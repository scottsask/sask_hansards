Hansard: June 29, 1992


 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 1101 

 June 29, 1992 

 

EVENING SITTING 
 

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 
 

Motions for Interim Supply 
 

The Chair: -- Order.  The business before the committee is 

interim supply, and in particular the motion by the Minister of 

Finance: 
 

 Resolved that a sum not exceeding $365,428,000 be granted 

to Her Majesty on account for the 12 months ending March 

31, 1993. 
 

Mr. Devine: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to give the 

minister an opportunity since supper time to perhaps respond to 

some of my earlier questions, and ask him again if he could 

outline, if he would, the role of the Saskatchewan Crop 

Insurance Corporation and its responsibilities during a drought, 

and how he Estimates what impact that might have on his 

budget.  I wondered if he could explain that to the public 

because obviously we could be in for a pretty serious drought.  

And we'd like to know how the insurance company fits into the 

scheme of things. 
 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, these are 

hypothetical questions.  We're dealing here with interim 

supply.  We're not dealing here with the policies of the 

Saskatchewan Crop Insurance or the program of Saskatchewan 

Crop Insurance.  I am not the minister in charge of the Crop 

Insurance and so therefore I am not in a position to answer the 

member from Estevan's question.  I can tell the member 

opposite that in the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance, for 

premiums there is a budget this year for $108 million plus 

some.  And the request in this interim supply is for one-twelfth 

of that. 
 

The Crop Insurance Corporation has some role to play in the 

event that there is a drought.  There is not a drought yet.  One 

can never predict.  There might be a drought.  But in the event 

that the Crop Insurance has a role to play there, that's really in 

the purview of the minister in charge of the Crop Insurance 

who will have to address that question when the Crop 

Insurance Corporation is before the legislature, before the 

committee. 
 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, are you saying to the House that 

in the event that there was a drought in say 25 per cent of the 

province of Saskatchewan's farm land, that it would have no 

impact on the budget?  No impact, there's no connection there?  

And if there is we would like to know that.  If there is not we 

would like to know it.  What are you saying, that there's no 

connection between a 25 per cent drought and the budget of 

Saskatchewan? 
 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, that would depend 

on a lot of things.  It would depend on the role of the federal 

government and what role the federal government might want 

to play.  The federal government has said, Mr. McKnight has 

said there might be additional money because of the money 

that the federal government has under the present 

circumstances.  So unless I know the situation, I can't respond 

in the hypothetical sense; I'm not going to.  That's not the way I 

deal with things.  Where 

it is within my jurisdiction as the Minister of Finance, I'm 

prepared to respond quite accurately within the terms of interim 

supply. 

 

What the member opposite is asking about is something that's 

within the jurisdiction of the minister in charge of the Crop 

Insurance Corporation who happens to be the minister in 

charge of Rural Affairs.  And he will have to have his officials 

here to assist him and then we'll be able to provide all the 

answers that the member from Estevan is asking questions to. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, when we get talking with 

other ministers -- I was here in Estimates in Education -- they 

say well that really, frankly, is the Minister of Finance because 

they want to know his view of how we would finance 

education.  And I asked about harmonization and about some 

other things.  I'm asking now how the province finances its 

crop insurance and its protection against drought.  Now that's 

right in your lap.  You know it's a multi-billion dollar 

corporation.  It insures farmers.  And there's a formula whereby 

Saskatchewan, like other provinces, participates in the 

co-operation with the federal government.  Now there must be 

some connection to your budget to the fact if there's a drought 

versus if there's a very good crop. 

 

I know you want to avoid that question, but I'm going to be 

very reluctant to leave here not having some relationship there 

because it seems to me, if I recall right, you have said from 

time to time, Saskatchewan and your budget can't afford to pay 

for drought because you'd have to raise taxes to do this.  So 

there must be some relationship between crop insurance and 

your budget.  Well I would like to hear what that is. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Yes the relationship is very clear.  

If the member looks at the budget Estimates, and if the member 

looks at the details of the second interim supply Bill which I 

provided to both parties in the opposition, he will find what the 

relationship is.  The relationship is that we have provided, as 

part of the needed funding for the Crop Insurance Corporation, 

$108.647 million for the full budget for this year.  We are 

asking in this interim supply Bill, which is what we are 

debating in this committee, one-twelfth of that, as is the case 

with most of the requests in most of the departments except 

where there are, I think, six exceptions because there are more, 

or in some cases less, than the need for one-twelfth. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, could you get your officials 

to tell me, tell the House, what assumptions you made about 

the crop when you made that estimate of $108 million, and 

what assumptions you made with respect to the crop and the 

relationship between what it might be and why you came up 

with $108 million.  And another part to that: you've assumed, I 

guess, Mr. Minister, that that was under the modified GRIP 

(gross revenue insurance program).  Is that true?  This was 

under the modified GRIP.  This was under the 1992 GRIP -- is 

that a fact? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I can address 

the member's question directly.  What we have 



1102 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

assumed in the Estimates here is a normal crop year -- not the 

bumper crop we had last year -- a normal crop year.  We have 

provided money on the basis of GRIP as it is for 1992, the 

program that is there for '92.  We've estimated in the GRIP . . . 

crop insurance 77 per cent take-up, and on the basis of our 

Estimates and on the basis of the money that we have provided 

we have no reason to feel that we will not be able to meet the 

objectives that were established and the targets that were made 

and the money that was provided. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Okay, Mr. Minister, we are starting to get some 

place.  You now said that this is going to cost you $108 

million, crop insurance, if there is a normal crop, with 77 per 

cent take-up and given the 1992 rules.  What is it, Mr. Minister, 

if it's half of normal? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, we are now getting 

into the bigger picture rather than the interim supply.  But that's 

a question that the member from Estevan is going to have to 

pose with the minister in charge of the Crop Insurance who will 

be able to answer that question.  We don't have that kind of 

information. 

 

We based the budget on certain assumptions.  I have said to the 

House and to the member for Estevan what those assumptions 

are.  That's as much as I can say.  That's as good an answer as I 

can give him. 

 

If he wants more specific . . . we determine the amount of 

money on the basis of a request made by the Crop Insurance 

Corporation on the best knowledge that the Crop Insurance 

Corporation has.  On the basis of their indications to us, the 

money is provided. 

 

All of the detail that the member opposite wants that the Crop 

Insurance Corporation will only be knowledgeable about -- not 

only, but that's their responsibility -- he should ask when the 

Crop Insurance Corporation is before the legislature.  This is 

not the Crop Insurance Corporation Estimates; this is interim 

supply asking for one-twelfth of the money that has been 

budgeted for the Crop Insurance Corporation or any other 

agency or department for which there has to be voted funds. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, you've also said that this is 

for 1992 GRIP.  Would you give me the estimate of what this 

would be under 1991 GRIP. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- No, Mr. Chairman, because this 

budget is not based on 1991 GRIP.  It is based on 1992 GRIP. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, now you have told the public 

what you thought it would cost, and I'm going to read your 

quotes of what you said it would cost and how you're trying to 

frighten people how you'd have to raise taxes to raise all this 

money if you had to pay crop insurance.  Now there's literally 

thousands and thousands of farmers out there who are very, 

very worried that they might not get a crop.  And on top of that 

you tell them that if I have to pay crop insurance I'm going to 

have to raise your taxes. 

 

Now you are telling me on one hand, really that's just a crop 

insurance issue; it has nothing to do with the budget. 

And you've said that over and over and over again.  Well if it 

doesn't, Mr. Minister, you must have some connection to the 

relationship because if it has something to do with the budget 

then you'd better be telling the taxpayers the connection. 

 

Now you tell me that this is based on 1991.  You must have 

some idea about 1992 and what it would cost you because the 

farmer knows that 1992 levers a lot more federal money.  So 

you should be able to give us some estimate, and I know your 

deputy has it, and I know your staff has it.  How much more 

money comes into Saskatchewan if you'd have based this on 

1991 GRIP, and what would it cost you and what would the 

farmers get?  That's a very relevant question to budget and 

financing, particularly when the whole thing's before this 

legislature and before the courts. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well the answer is very simple, Mr. 

Chairman.  We did not base any Estimates on 1992 GRIP . . . 

or 1991 GRIP.  The Estimates here are based on the . . . in this 

budget are based on the programs and expenditure proposals as 

they applied in 1991.  And that is what we have based the 

numbers on, $108 million in crop insurance.  The member's 

been talking about crop insurance.  That's what's budgeted in 

the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation and that's what 

we project is going to be the expenditure that we're going to 

have to make this year in order to meet our obligations. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, could you tell the House if there's 

a significant variation in this estimate if there's a 25 per cent 

drought, as opposed to your estimate of a normal crop, and 

what that might be.  You'd have that.  Your deputy has it; your 

staff has it.  But the public needs to know that because you're 

threatening tax increases if there's a drought.  Now you can't 

threaten tax increases if there's a drought unless you have some 

relationship there.  What is the relationship between drought 

and crop insurance and the Estimates you're preparing here that 

you want us to give the benefit of the doubt so that you can 

have your money? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, this is so 

hypothetical that it's impossible to answer the question.  In 

other words, the member from Estevan is saying, if there was a 

bumper crop we'd have money just pouring in and therefore 

we'd be erring on the other side.  I don't deal in those kind of 

hypothetical situations.  I can tell the House what it is we have 

budgeted, and I've given an outline of the assumptions we have 

made in providing that kind of allocation of funding, of money, 

for that budget.  There's nothing more I can say.  If the member 

wants to talk in detail about the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance 

Corporation, then he's going to have to ask the minister in 

charge when the minister is here in committee, because he will 

have the Crop Insurance officials here who will be able to 

provide the answers. 

 

(1915) 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, can you give us any estimate at 

all of the amount of money that it would cost your treasury to 

have 1991 GRIP normal conditions versus 1992 GRIP normal 

conditions?  Can you give us that comparison? 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1103 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- The answer, Mr. Chairman, is no, I 

cannot. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm going to have to call 

the minister on that because you've been telling the public that.  

You have an estimate in your own news release on interim 

supply.  You tell the public it's going to cost several hundred 

million dollars and you're going to have to raise taxes in your 

own news release.  And now you won't talk about it here.  

You're willing to talk about it outside the House and you're 

willing to talk about it in letters that go out, but you're not 

willing to defend it in here.  You say well let's go and pawn it 

off on some minister or some other minister. 

 

In your own news release you say Saskatchewan does not have 

the 2 to 300 million extra we would be at risk for by going 

back to 1991 GRIP.  And you published that.  Now how do you 

get that connection?  You've got to justify that before you get 

interim supply out of a legislature that is facing a crisis across 

Saskatchewan and drought in some parts of the province 

regardless of the weather, and maybe even a 25 per cent or a 50 

per cent. 

 

And you're saying well gosh we can't even back it up, we can't 

lever federal money and without raising taxes.  And I'm telling 

you there's no connection between this year's crop insurance 

and your budget. 

 

So frightening people . . . Let me just put it this way.  If you 

said this, Mr. Minister, then you've got to be able to defend it 

or else withdraw it and say to the public, it's not true. 

 

You said it costs 2 to 300 million more to have 1991 GRIP for 

the province of Saskatchewan.  I don't believe that.  That's 

saying you're frightening people.  It means that kind of money 

and more going into the farmer's pocket, mostly federal money 

with a 65/35 per cent relationship. 

 

Mr. Minister, I want you to explain to the public why you said 

this kind of money, and the difference between '91 and '92 and 

what it would cost the taxpayer, and any kind of a relationship 

you want to come up with because you can't just get off scaring 

people like this, frightening people. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, when the 

proper officials are here to be able to address that, when the 

Crop Insurance Corporation or the Department of . . . 

(inaudible interjection) . . . the member from Rosthern, you be 

patient.  When the Crop Insurance Corporation or the 

Department of Agriculture are here to discuss the various 

programs, we'll be able to answer those questions.  When the 

Department of Finance is here doing Estimates for the 

Department of Finance, which talks about the overall policies 

of the budget and the overall budget, we will then have the 

officials here to be able to answer that as well. 

 

We're not here doing that, Mr. Chairman.  We're here 

answering interim supply, which is for about approximately 

one-twelfth of the requirement that the government needs to 

pay the bills under the proposed budget.  That's what we're here 

for.  At the appropriate 

committee we'll be able to address those questions, and I invite 

the member from Estevan to keep them in mind, not to forget 

them, and ask them then. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, this news . . . this is the 

Government of Saskatchewan, Mr. Minister, news release, 

Department of Finance.  This isn't Crop Insurance release; this 

is the Department of Finance.  Now your name is on here, the 

deputy's name, the letter-head, all of this stuff, and it says 

"Saskatchewan does not have the $200 million to the $300 

million extra . . ." 

 

So this is Finance has already done the numbers.  I know that 

and you know that.  I want you to share that relationship and 

the numbers with this Assembly and your colleagues and with 

the farmers and the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

You want supply, you want to spend your money.  Now you've 

reneged on a contract and farmers are worried.  There's a threat 

of a drought.  You got elected in a crisis and you say there's 2 

or $300 million at stake that would charge the taxpayers, which 

is not true but you've left that impression.  So you can't get off 

pawning this off onto somebody else like in Crop Insurance; 

this is yours.  This is the Department of Finance and you have 

to justify those figures if you're going to get any support on 

interim supply, because the figures obviously aren't accurate -- 

therefore you must be frightening people -- or if they are, 

would you explain the relationship to the public and to the 

taxpayers so that we know what you're talking about. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, let me try to be 

helpful here because we want to be able to provide all the 

information that the legislature needs and requires.  We're here 

for interim supply.  If the member wants an analysis of all of 

that, I'll undertake to provide it to him and we will get it.  And 

if we need to ask the Department of Agriculture to give us an 

analysis we'll provide it.  But this is interim supply.  We don't 

have that here, Mr. Chairman.  But I'll give the member from 

Estevan the undertaking to work that out and provide it to him. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, all interim supply is is 

one-twelfth of what you expect to spend.  So we're talking 

about the overall Estimates of what you're going to do with 

your money.  We have a serious, serious amount of money here 

of 2 or $300 million that you're freely talking about outside the 

legislature and you won't address it in here.  And you're asking 

us to say well go ahead and spend this but cut the heart out of 

the Crop Insurance Corporation or don't pay the farmers or I'm 

going to have to raise taxes, when it's just not true. 

 

We've got to have the facts here if we're going to address 

interim supply.  We need to know how much a variation in 

crop insurance numbers will influence the interim supply 

month by month, or the overall budget.  And that's pretty 

significant because if it in fact is not connected to this year's 

budget then your hocus-pocus about raising taxes to pay for a 

drought is not on and we can correct that to the public and 

farmers can then realize they're entitled to crop insurance. 

 

And secondly, if we go back and look at what you might get in 

levering federal money, which could be 100, 200, 



1104 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

300, or $400 million, into the province of Saskatchewan, and 

we come to find out you won't receive that money because you 

won't have Crop Insurance participate even if it doesn't cost 

you on your budget this year -- and, like you said, maybe not 

even next year or the year after -- then we're doubly concerned, 

Mr. Minister, because you're not levering the federal money 

like other provinces are, and you're pulling a cruel hoax, a 

sham, on the taxpayers because even if we use 1992 GRIP, you 

don't have to raise taxes to pay for a drought. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, I think you're being unfair to the taxpayer, 

unfair to the farmers, unfair to your colleagues, unfair to the 

members of the legislature, and to the role as a minister that 

will put out: this is what it's going to cost -- and then stand in 

here in interim supply and you're the minister in charge of 

financing, and not talk about a $300 million statement that 

you're prepared to make outside the House. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, you wouldn't convince anybody here, I don't 

think many on either side of the House, that you can get around 

this.  We haven't been in here for two weeks because people 

have been worried about this, and you say, oh it doesn't matter; 

it doesn't matter.  There's no connection.  Go see Crop 

Insurance.  You go see Crop Insurance and they'll say, go see 

the Finance people; they want all our money.  Well there must 

be a relationship, and it must be pretty significant.  So, Mr. 

Minister, again I ask you, please, for the farmers and for the 

taxpayers, the members of the legislature, tell us what happens 

to your budget under various kinds of drought conditions in '91 

crop insurance program or the '92 crop insurance program, so 

we know what we're up against.  Because you have said it costs 

up to $300 million.  Would you please defend that number, 

explain it, or tell people that you were just throwing out 

numbers. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to 

agree with the member that interim supply is what the 

government intends to spend for one-twelfth of the fiscal year.  

And that's what we're here for, for one-twelfth of the fiscal 

year, for interim supply.  Nothing about what the member 

opposite talks about in his last comments will have an impact 

one way or the other on this interim supply Bill or the 

expenditure requested here, for this one-twelfth.  There will be 

no impact on it.  This is a straight number, straight amount of 

expenditures.  It's clear; it will not change.  That's what's 

required for July, nothing more and nothing less. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, we have the minister of 

Crop Insurance who says it's going to be one number.  We have 

the Minister of Agriculture who says it's probably going to be 

40 to $60 million.  And then we have the Minister of Finance 

who said it's going to be 2 to $300 million.  Now the public 

deserves to know. 

 

If we could get you all on your feet at the same time, all on 

Estimates, and then the Premier to kind of ride herd on you, 

then we could probably get you to admit that what you're doing 

is trying to frighten the people about 1991 GRIP.  And number 

two, there is no relationship between the Crop Insurance 

expenditures in an insurance company and the 1992 taxes. 

So whether it's a twelfth, Mr. Minister, or whether it's half of it 

or all of it, you must be somewhat interested in Crop Insurance 

and its number.  And I'm asking you to share those scenarios 

with the public.  Because this is one-twelfth of -- what have 

you got -- a $5 billion budget, $5.2 billion.  You say, well don't 

worry about it.  It's just a twelfth.  Well that's not the point that 

it's a twelfth.  How does the relation work?  Because when it's 

all over at the end of the year it will be 12 out of 12.  How do 

you come up with the number of 108?  And how does that 

number vary if there's a 25 per cent drought and you've got to 

have that number?  And how would it vary if in fact the court 

case wins and the farmer gets 1992 GRIP . . . 1991 GRIP, and 

we lever a whole bunch of federal money in here?  How much 

more does Saskatchewan get in federal dollars if we had 1992 

GRIP . . . 1991 GRIP over '92? 

 

Those questions you've worked out.  You had to, to make this 

news release.  This news release is now a part of Estimates.  It 

is now a part of interim supply.  It's yours.  It comes from the 

Department of Finance.  You can't say this belongs to Crop 

Insurance or to Agriculture, or the lady down the street, or any 

place else.  This is yours.  And you've got to be able to justify 

that and explain to your colleagues in the legislature the 

relationship between that 2 and $300 million out of '91 GRIP 

versus '92, and the impact on any drought . . . of any drought 

on the budget in Saskatchewan. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I repeat again that 

nothing that can happen, whether we get indications of a 

bumper crop or whether we get indications of some disaster out 

there, will impact on the amount of money that's being 

requested in this interim supply Bill.  It's one-twelfth of the 

$108 million in Crop Insurance that has been budgeted which 

the interim supply Bill is requesting.  So there can be no impact 

on that under any circumstances.  We are operating under the 

1992 farm program, the 1992 GRIP program; not under the 

1991.  That's been decided.  That's in the budget.  That's what 

we can afford.  There are some changes that were beneficial.  

And all we're doing here is asking for one-twelfth.  That cannot 

change. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, I'm going to read this sentence 

again to you, and if you want I'll send it across to you.  It says, 

and I quote, it's you talking: Saskatchewan does not have the 

200 million to 300 million extra we would be at risk for by 

going back to 1991 GRIP.  Would you please explain that 

statement so that we can have some estimate of what you base 

your one-twelfth interim supply on when it comes to Crop 

Insurance?  Please do that, Mr. Minister. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, without getting into 

any details, because I said to the member opposite, we'll 

provide the analysis and the people in Crop Insurance and the 

Minister of Agriculture will provide some details, but the 

Estimates that the member talks about were based on the 

discussion that was taking place with regard to the GRIP 

program and the crop insurance program and the amount of 

extra that would be expended in premiums both by, some by 

producers, some by the provincial government, and in the event 

that there were crop failures of a significant amount.  But we 

don't have 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1105 

that here.  That's something that is in the Department of 

Agriculture information.  I will ask the Department of 

Agriculture to provide that analysis and we will then make it 

available to the member, even as early as we can. 

 

(1930) 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, this was June 23, last week, out 

of your department.  June 23, 1992, a news release, Finance 

No. 92-417, and you said it's going to cost 2 or $300 million 

more if the court was successful in saying that you're guilty and 

1991 crop insurance came out.  Now you know that that's not 

the case.  It wouldn't cost you that.  That's a false statement and 

you can't get out of here giving false statements.  That would 

not cost Saskatchewan people $300 million.  It might cost the 

feds something like that and you'd have to pony up your fair 

share, another 3, 4, $500 million in total which is a lot of 

money for Saskatchewan people.  But don't tell the people of 

Saskatchewan it's going to cost you that and put it out under 

Finance letter-head as if you knew what you're talking about.  

This is last week you said this and now you deny it or now you 

say it isn't part of your analysis.  You must have had analysis to 

say this.  And I want you to prove it to this House and to the 

people of Saskatchewan.  Or we know, as we suspect, that your 

whole budget operation is as hoaxy as this statement. 

 

All the accumulation of all the stuff you bring up in one year, 

then you say we've got to pay for it all now, and then from now 

on we'll be cash accounting -- the old big bat theory, scare the 

pants off people.  We can't even give them crop insurance.  Use 

these numbers and now you won't talk about them.  Mr. 

Minister, I give you another chance.  Tell us how you come up 

with $300 million last week. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, the matter that the 

member raises has got nothing to do with interim supply, so I'm 

not going to deal with those kinds of issues which belong in the 

bigger committee of Agriculture, Crop Insurance, and the 

Estimates of the Department of Finance.  Well we're talking 

about policy, overall government budget, and so on. 

 

We're here with interim supply, and, Mr. Chairman, I think that 

the House should be dealing with what is under the 

consideration of the interim supply which is the one-twelfth 

expenditure. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, obviously the chairman knows 

that if you're talking about a 2 or $300 million variation it 

might impact interim supply and one-twelfth.  Now I'm trying 

to find out for the public and the taxpayers because you've had 

-- we'll get the quote . . . you say we'll have to raise taxes.  The 

Premier said taxes may have to go up if we pay crop insurance.  

And you know that's not accurate.  Therefore you know that it 

hasn't got an impact on this year's one-twelfth, or this year's 

budget at all.  But you're saying it, and I'm calling you on it 

here. 

 

And you can't get away with it and say, well but we're only 

dealing with the twelfth; therefore I can't talk about it.  Or there 

might not ever be any impact on Crop Insurance, or I really 

didn't mean anything by 1991 costing $300 million.  Well you 

meant a lot.  That's a great 

deal of money.  So, Mr. Minister, again I've got to come back 

and say: you either retract that statement or you defend it.  How 

can you ignore it in this legislature? 

 

You just said it last week, and here you are standing in your 

place as the minister.  Only a $500 million deficit after all your 

tax increases and now you're threatening more.  Mr. Minister, 

you have to defend this statement or retract it and tell people 

the truth, which is simply this: the crop insurance pay-outs this 

year have nothing to do with taxes in 1992-93.  And that's the 

truth. 

 

Can you . . . I'll tell you what, Mr. Minister, could you accept 

or deny that last statement?  Is that true?  Well I'm sorry to get 

your attention.  Is it?  The 1992 crop insurance, 1992 crop 

insurance, does it have anything at all to do with the tax level 

in 1992 and '93? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, obviously 

when there are certain tax measures in the budget, which we'll 

talk about when we get into the Estimates of the Department of 

Finance and the different tax Bills, they're there to meet the 

expenditures of the government overall. They're not targeted . . 

. tax measures aren't targeted for this program or that program 

or some other program.  The member opposite knows that it 

goes to the Consolidated Fund, and the reason why we've had 

to have the tax measures is so that we could pay the bills and 

keep the deficit down to $517 million. 

 

So indirectly of course it has some.  But the taxes aren't 

targeted for any one expenditure of government or the other.  

They go into the Consolidated Fund.  And we need the 

revenues to pay the bills and keep the deficit down.  Next year 

because of the plans we've put into place in this budget the 

deficit will go down some more.  And we'll be making those 

decisions on the 1993 budget when we get around to it and 

when we do the next budgetary cycle which is going to start 

very soon. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Just a minute, look at these two pieces of paper.  

This is the Estimates that you gave me and it's got total to be 

voted, $108.647 million and one-twelfth of that.  Now a week 

later, earlier, you've got this could vary by $300 million.  Well 

there's the two of them and you want me to pass interim supply, 

one-twelfth of a variation of $400 million. 

 

Now, Mr. Minister, you can't just stand in your place and say, 

well trust me, it'll be all right, when you're going around telling 

the taxpayers, well I'll have to raise taxes if I got to pay that 

GRIP.  It's not the case.  That $300 million is three times your 

total estimate of Crop Insurance.  And if you refuse to answer 

that . . . I mean we can take Hansard and take it around the 

province too.  You're out $300 million on your guess what this 

might be, and you won't explain it. 

 

You could clear it up if you just tell us about the 2 to $300 

million.  Would you do that? -- 2 to $300 million it would cost 

Saskatchewan if you had to pay out the crop insurance.  Please 

explain that.  Because you've got two different figures here. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, as the budget is now 

and as the interim supply request that is before the 



1106 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

House, there will be no changes, the kind of which the member 

talks about.  The issue the member talks about has got nothing 

to do with the present budget or with the 1991 GRIP program . 

. . 1992 GRIP program or with the amount of money that's 

being requested in interim supply.  He's mixing two different 

things all together which is not even relevant to the issue that 

we're discussing here. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Obviously when the Minister of Agriculture 

was asked, well how will you make the '92 changes legal, he'll 

say, we'll get around it somehow, quote/unquote, and I'm 

paraphrasing.  You obviously had some preconceived notion 

that 1991 GRIP, if there was a drought, might pay farmers 

pretty well.  Now that would cost the Crop Insurance 

Corporation some money and you said it would cost 2 to $300 

million at the same time saying and that would have to be 

raised by taxes.  The whole budget for Crop Insurance is only a 

third of that.  Are you telling us or trying to tell the public that 

you want us to believe that '92 GRIP is only one-third of 1991, 

in terms of crop insurance?  That's what it is, your one number 

last week is 300 million for '91 GRIP, this today is 100 million. 

 

So you're telling me that we lost a third of the support for 

farmers going to your leg . . . no wonder they're upset.  No 

wonder they're upset, they've doubled the premiums and they 

got one-third the coverage, one-third the total coverage and 

you've doubled the premiums, no wonder they're upset and the 

wind blows and the drier it gets, they're going to say, well, ring 

the bells, boys. 

 

I've got your two numbers here and you can't get out from 

under them.  Well, Mr. Minister, you have got a serious, 

serious question to answer, serious question.  Which number is 

accurate?  And if they're both accurate would you explain the 

relationship between 1991 and 1992? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman . . . (inaudible 

interjection) . . . any time.  Mr. Chairman, let me make it very 

clear, the accurate number we're dealing with today is interim 

supply for one-twelfth of the money that has been budgeted for 

the Crop Insurance Corporation.  The money that has been 

budgeted which is going to have to be voted is $108.647 

million.  That's what's in the budget.  That includes the 1992 

GRIP program and the Crop Insurance program.  That's clear, 

nothing confusing about that or misleading about it.  We're 

talking about the 1992 budget of this government and hopefully 

this legislature's eventually and we're asking for one-twelfth 

which is $9.054 million.  That's got nothing to do with what the 

member refers to in the paper that he's waving around -- got 

nothing to do with the 1992 GRIP or crop insurance program. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, if we took one-twelfth of last 

week's estimate, it would be $25 million, one-twelfth of 300 

million.  Now this week it's one-twelfth of 108, so you got her 

down to 9. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Wait another week. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Heck yes, we can keep waiting and waiting and 

we'll get it right down there and of course, the farmers have 

less and less protection.  You've doubled the 

cost to them.  You've pulled back; other provinces are there 

ponying up for them and if there is a disaster in other provinces 

at least they pay their share.  Here, no we won't do that.  So you 

cancel this and you cancel these and you cancel programs and 

you raise taxes and then you threaten people with more and 

more taxes if you have to pay crop insurance.  Now if you 

think these numbers are accurate, I just asked the minister, are 

these numbers out of your financial department from last week 

and your words accurate as well? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, for the purposes of 

interim supply we're dealing with what is in the budget.  That's 

provided.  I have provided it to the members opposite in 

printed form so that they would be made available.  There's 

nothing inaccurate about it. 

 

The debate that the member talks about during the time that the 

members opposite were ringing the bells was another issue, the 

issues dealing with the proposals of the federal government, 

proposals of the members opposite, 1991 GRIP.  We're not 

here talking about 1991 GRIP program as it was.  We're here 

asking for interim supply for the 1992 GRIP and crop 

insurance program. 

 

Mr. Devine: --  But, Mr. Minister, wouldn't you believe if it's 

your officials that are using their talents to forecast 108 million 

that I say well fair enough, they've got a good forecast of what 

would cost.  Now I'm just testing your forecasting ability.  

Would you tell me how they forecasted 300 million so I have 

something to compare it to?  Because we're trying to find out if 

you know what you're talking about. 

 

You forecasted that '91 would cost 300 million and you 

forecasted that '92 would cost a 108.  And one of them is 

obviously way out of whack.  Now if it's not accurate and if 

you've got 150 degrees of freedom on these Estimates on either 

end of it, why should we believe that one-twelfth or one-tenth 

or one-half or all of it is anywhere close?  You see my point? 

 

Last week you said we should believe you at 300 million and 

your officials.  It does. It's your estimate of crop insurance.  

Well explain it.  Explain it.  What formula did you use?  Is it 

the same formula you used for 108?  Is this normal crop under 

1991 that would cost 300 million more?  Who pays for that? 

 

You see, Mr. Minister, that's the reason people are upset.  You 

say all kinds of things that don't make any sense and they don't 

add up.  You've got them frightened because of tax increases 

and you've certainly levelled those.  I mean, just everything 

you said you'd never do -- you've raised taxes, raised taxes, 

raised taxes, raised taxes.  Now you've cut their crop insurance 

program.  And then if they did happen to win in court you 

scared them by saying but that would cost the Saskatchewan 

people, Saskatchewan, you say 300 million.  It's absolutely 

false because the whole crop insurance is only 108. 

 

Well I don't know how you explain this to your caucus.  How 

do you explain it to your party and how do you explain it to 

your farmers and how do you explain it to anybody?  Any other 

members, you explain it.  Anybody over there.  Anybody there 

or there, could you stand up 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1107 

and explain this estimate?  I mean if somebody else wants to 

take a run at this you're more than welcome.  I've got no 

answers out of the minister and he's afraid to answer.  He's got 

two Estimates of crop insurance and he won't address it.  I 

know one of them, Mr. Minister, is absolutely false.  It's either 

this one or this one is absolutely false.  And you can't pass 

interim supply giving information that is false.  So clear it up.  

Which one of these is an accurate estimate of what crop 

insurance would cost the public, and explain the difference 

because they're 300 per cent difference, which is just totally 

unacceptable. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I say again, I refer 

the member to the budget documents which show that the 

budget for the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation, 

which will be voted at the end when the budget is finally 

passed by this House, is $108.647 million.  That's for 1992-93 

under the existing programs as outlined by the Minister of 

Agriculture and the Minister of Rural Affairs. 

 

We are asking for one-twelfth of that $100-and-some million.  

That's pretty clear.  Under the 1992 program, as it exists, that's 

accurate.  The member can talk about it not being accurate, but 

I'll be able to stand up in this House during the next fiscal year 

and show to the member opposite, unless there's something 

happens that is unpredictable, that that objective is going to be 

met.  The member can hold me to that.  But the budget is clear 

and firm and he will see whether we achieve it or not, and if we 

don't we'll have a good explanation for it. 

 

(1945) 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, you must realize that there's 

more to this Legislative Assembly than you giving us your 

word that this is going to all work out when you walk out of the 

legislature and you tell the public something all together 

different.  This House means that there's grievance before 

supply.  We want to know how you do this.  And you've made 

a wild, wild inaccurate statement last week about costs to 

GRIP.  For all we know maybe it costs less to have 1991 in the 

medium to the long haul because you're going to have money 

in farmers' pockets.  They won't be on welfare, they won't be 

going to court. 

 

I mean for Heaven's sakes you know there's a crisis out there 

and you won't even talk to me or the farmers or the public 

about how you're going to address that.  You throw out 

statements that you can't defend.  Obviously this is wrong.  

You can't defend this; you don't even want to try.  You don't 

even acknowledge it. 

 

Mr. Minister, would you acknowledge that you put this out?  

Would you acknowledge that?  Sorry, didn't mean to get your 

attention.  Did you publish this statement last week? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, we're not here 

debating what happened last week.  We're here debating 

interim supply.  Obviously if there's a press release that it was 

issued at a press conference under my name, I issued it.  But 

that's got nothing to do with the interim supply Bill and what 

we're requesting here, which is appropriation for all of the 

expenditures of the 

government on which there has to be a vote. 

 

And, Mr. Chairman, I have already said to the member 

opposite, all the analysis he want will be prepared by the Crop 

Insurance Corporation and by the Department of Agriculture.  

And he will have an explanation for all of those questions 

dealing with those things directly related to those agencies and 

those departments, because they are the ones who have the 

information and will be able to provide it. 

 

I will undertake, as I said earlier, to make sure that they 

provide the information not only to the Minister of Agriculture, 

but I'll get informed about it when they provide the information 

to the Minister of Agriculture.  So that if you don't get your 

answers in the Department of Agriculture, and I know that you 

will, when those Estimates are here, we'll be able to address 

them when the Department of Finance Estimates are before the 

House.  We're not dealing with the Department of Finance 

Estimates here. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, you now have acknowledged that 

you actually said this and it's your release.  I have another 

question.  Just take it slowly now.  Did you provide these 

numbers from your department or did you get the numbers 

from Crop Insurance?  That should be easy enough for the 

officials to decide.  Was it their estimate, or was it Crop 

Insurance estimate, this 2 to $300 million? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, obviously those are 

numbers that would come from Crop Insurance and would 

come from the Department of Agriculture.  And that's why I 

keep saying that that's the appropriate place to ask those 

questions. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, then obviously you believed this 

number, 2 or $300 million, that came from Crop Insurance.  

This number that came here today, is that from Crop Insurance 

or is that from Agriculture, or is that from the Department of 

Finance -- the 108 million? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- It's in the budget.  It's in the budget 

of this government which has been presented in the House.  

The member knows how it works.  The Crop Insurance 

obviously presented to the government a requirement of a 

certain amount of money.  And therefore, that kind of money is 

provided for the Crop Insurance Corporation.  And it's here.  

And you've got it. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, you're telling me that I can go out 

to the farmers and say, Crop Insurance gave us an estimate of 

the Department of Finance that would cost $300 million more 

if we went to '91 GRIP.  Now that's what you've said.  Now I'm 

going to go find Crop Insurance officials that will give me 

anything close to that, and I'll bet you they're scarce as hen's 

teeth.  You won't find Crop Insurance officials to admit to that.  

That's right out of your department.  That's right out of your 

office.  I know enough about Crop Insurance, being the 

minister at one time, and there are certainly other people here 

who have been the minister.  That didn't come out of Crop 

Insurance. 

 

Mr. Minister, well you're on record saying this estimate of 



1108 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

$300 million in GRIP 1991 came out of Crop Insurance.  Now 

you're taking this whole load of your financial problems and 

your own political mistakes, and you're blaming Crop 

Insurance officials or the Crop Insurance minister. 

 

Well, Mr. Minister, didn't you check the number that came 

from Crop Insurance?  Did you believe it?  Did you believe the 

number, the 300 million -- that it was three times what the 

number in the budget is?  Did you not even think about it when 

you said this? 

 

Well I just ask you, Mr. Minister, was it just convenient to 

throw out 300 million to frighten people?  Or didn't you think 

at all that that might be three times the entire Crop Insurance 

budget in one statement?  And then you'd say, oh my gosh, I'd 

have to tax people and the media might just believe me. 

 

Well I'll tell you, Mr. Minister, that's poor.  That's poor.  You 

can't just blame Crop Insurance officials.  And your people, 

certainly Finance people, know exactly whether that's relevant 

or not, or any connection to what it is. 

 

Mr. Minister, would you just confirm or not whether you 

actually checked or even thought about confirming this 

estimate of $300 million to the Saskatchewan taxpayer if you 

went to 1991 GRIP. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, we're not here 

talking about 1991 GRIP.  We're here talking about the interim 

supply Bill which is asking for one-twelfth of the funding 

generally for the expenditures of the government, based on the 

1992 budget of the government -- which includes the 1992 

GRIP program, which is in place and under which farmers have 

subscribed. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, could you just give us a break?  If 

you're not afraid of '91, and farmers want it, and you're in court 

over it, and it doesn't affect your Estimates much -- or interim 

supply much -- and it levers a bunch more money, hundreds of 

millions of dollars from the federal government, why don't you 

just go for 1991? 

 

We've been through this with the Speaker who's been kind 

enough to set it aside so we can talk about it.  And it's a lot of 

money for Saskatchewan people.  They need insurance 

coverage.  Goodness knows they need insurance.  And you 

won't admit that there's any connection.  I'll take you at your 

word.  There's no real connection to the budget.  Why not just 

give them '91?  They'll have great coverage.  We'll work 

through improved GRIP in '93 and '94 and '95. 

 

You see my point?  This is Estimates of how the government is 

going to spend its money for the people.  The last time I 

looked, about half the population was rural.  And the towns and 

villages and the people that come in to shop and spend their 

money are important part of Saskatchewan.  And they need 

your help.  They really do. 

 

Mr. Chairman, we get these catcalls from the MLAs (Member 

of the Legislative Assembly) in the back -- the member from 

the Quills -- who must know that there are people that are 

hurting all over the province. 

Mr. Chairman, would you ask the member from Quills if he'd 

answer this question if he thinks he's got some relevant 

information . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . You wouldn't get 

elected on this material.  You wouldn't get elected on this 

material.  You don't even come clean at election time.  Hey, 

come on.  Tax, rip up the rural roads, cut out their pension plan, 

take away their insurance programs, want to get on . . . What is 

this, we're going to debate the election here, Mr. Minister? 

 

Where's the real brochure?  Where's the real brochure? 

 

The Chair: -- Order, order.  Order.  The members have an 

opportunity to ask questions of the minister, and we should 

allow the minister an opportunity to respond.  Other members 

who want to ask questions should take their turn and do so. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, I'll just ask again.  Do you think 

that the provision of 1991 crop insurance coverage for farmers 

would have changed your Estimates in an appreciable way?  

Would it have done that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Obviously, Mr. Chairman, it's a 

hypothetical question.  We're not here debating the substantive 

issues of the Bill which the member referred to, which was the 

issue of the bell-ringing that took 18 days away from the 

legislature.  That's not what interim supply is.  That's out of 

order. 

 

We're not here debating the GRIP program.  That's something 

that the Minister of Agriculture is going to have to respond to 

when his committee is before this legislature.  The member 

opposite knows that.  He's trying to make some other point 

which is beyond me, but that's fine.  That's not my concern.  I 

won't be able to respond on either the GRIP program or the 

substantive issues of the Bill because that's not within my 

realm of responsibility.  The appropriate ministers are going to 

have to deal with that.  I'm here responding to questions 

dealing with interim supply. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, interim supply is money.  That's 

what we're talking about.  And you've recently mentioned a 2 

or $300 million variation in the amount of money you may 

have to spend.  Well we can at least ask you how to explain 

that variation. 

 

If there's no connection, would you tell the farmers and tell the 

public that there's no connection between '91 and '92 GRIP as a 

financial exposure and your Estimates.  Either there is or there 

isn't.  And if there's not, fine; we can talk seriously about going 

to something that'll provide several hundred million dollars 

more to Saskatchewan people -- Lord knows they need it. 

 

And if there is a connection, it would be interesting to know if 

it really did impact on taxes or not because if it didn't then Crop 

Insurance as a financial corporation carries that on and back 

and forth as any insurance company does.  And this whole 

hocus-pocus about 300 million and higher taxes might just be a 

sham.  It might not be the truth, which would mean we could 

actually get federal money coming into the province of 

Saskatchewan with hardly any additional cost to the 

Saskatchewan 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1109 

taxpayer, and it wouldn't have any impact on this year's budget 

and maybe not any on next year's.  Mr. Minister, can you tell us 

from a financial point of view -- just finances -- what impact 

various programs can have on your Estimates. 

 

The Chair: -- Order, order, order.  Members on both sides are 

intervening in the questioning. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, could you try once again to reach 

down and say, I will give you some indication of the impact of 

a '91 program over a '92, so that we can have some idea 

whether it would have a significant impact on your budget or 

not.  Because people would really like to know that.  It's a 

question on everybody's lips all across Saskatchewan, and 

indeed across the country.  They've been listening to the 

bell-ringing.  It's a financial question.  It's a legal question, one; 

and a financial question, number two.  So we need to know. 

 

Let me put it another way, Mr. Minister.  And it is 

hypothetical, and I grant you, but the taxpayer might like to 

know.  What if the courts were to say, we had to do '91 GRIP 

in '92?  Now you must have some idea what that would cost, 

even if we wanted to build in a provision to protect you; if we 

want a provision in here so you'd meet your targets.  Would 

you admit, or would you come forth, with your Estimates?  I 

know you have them.  I know you do, and your officials know 

that you do.  Departmental stuff is all there before you.  You 

had to have something to come up with the $300 million.  If 

you would just clear it up at all, then we could tell where we 

are in terms of exposure. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, could you just ask your officials again to give 

you any information with respect to the impact of 1991 kind of 

program on the financial exposure in the province of 

Saskatchewan for our one-twelfth, versus a 1992 program and 

its financial exposure on one-twelfth of the budget, which is 

Crop Insurance and all the rest of them.  Could you talk to us 

about that relationship. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- The answer, Mr. Chairman, is no, I 

cannot talk about that relationship because the GRIP program 

is not something that the Minister of Finance is going to deal 

with in an interim supply Bill.  The GRIP program and the crop 

insurance program is something that's going to be dealt with by 

the Minister of Agriculture and by the minister in charge of the 

crop insurance program, at the appropriate time when they're 

before the House, because they have the officials.  They are the 

ministers who are able, and will be able, to provide the 

information.  The 1991 GRIP program will not impact on this 

interim supply Bill because we don't have a 1991 GRIP 

program. We have a 1992 GRIP program on which the budget 

for Crop Insurance and GRIP is based. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, you spent a great deal of trouble 

and time in your cabinet, and I'm sure in your caucus meetings, 

changing the '91 program for financial reasons.  Why won't you 

share with us what your financial concerns were?  You say so 

in the public, you say so in the press, it's in the newspaper, 

radio, and television. 

 

(2000) 

We came in here to talk about your Estimates and interim 

supply -- can't talk about that.  That's unacceptable Mr. 

Minister, it's unacceptable -- to explain to us why you had this 

big concern about 1991 crop when it comes to financing.  I'm 

not talking about the specifics of the program.  You're the 

Finance minister.  What did you think '91 GRIP would cost 

you? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, the minister in 

charge of the GRIP program, the Minister of Agriculture, will 

be able to answer that question.  As the Minister of Finance I 

put together, or the government put together under my 

stewardship or through the Treasury Board, the funding 

necessary for the 1992 GRIP program.  That is clear.  That is in 

the budget.  It's in the budget speech.  It's in the Estimates.  It 

has also been made very clear in the interim supply information 

which I have handed over to the members opposite. 

 

There is not more that I can say to address the concern of the 

member opposite.  The Minister of Agriculture will be able to 

provide the analysis that the member opposite wants.  I've 

already indicated that we're going . . . that I'm going to direct or 

request the Crop Insurance Corporation, Department of 

Agriculture, to put that analysis together.  I'm sure they have 

already.  But that's not the officials nor the minister who's here 

tonight, because this is an interim supply Bill, and not the 

GRIP program or the crop insurance program, which will be in 

this House in the near future. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, a couple of points here.  

You put this out knowing that we're going be into interim 

supply in the next couple of days. This is under your heading.  

And number two, Mr. Minister -- and I'm going to read you the 

last half of this -- you took over the crop insurance department, 

you talked about GRIP all through your release like you were 

the spokesman for the financial considerations in GRIP. 

 

It goes on to say the following: 

 

 "As well, our farmers have made their cropping decisions 

based on 1992 GRIP and the government has made its budget 

Estimates on 1992 GRIP.  There is no other program 

available to farmers. 

 

 "Anyone telling you that 1991 GRIP can be made easily 

available simply by pulling the current legislation is not 

being truthful." 

 

 Tchorzewski said that the June 24 GRIP court case will 

obviously be fought without the bill entered as evidence. 

 

And you went on to talk about GRIP. 

 

Now here's the Minister of Finance talking, number one, about 

financing, an up to $300 million problem; number two, he talks 

about GRIP as if he's the minister of Crop Insurance.  But you 

get him in the legislature -- oops, he's disappeared.  And there's 

no Crop Insurance minister here, because it's your interim 

supply, and you won't even talk about what you did a couple of 

days ago knowing we'd be in here talking about these numbers. 



1110 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

Mr. Minister, the public wants to know what you're so worried 

about.  Why are you worried about 1991 GRIP?  What would it 

do to help the farmers?  And what would it cost this 

government? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Speaker, I am unable to say to 

the member opposite what the 1991 GRIP program would be 

because I am not the Minister of Agriculture.  The Minister of 

Agriculture will be quite prepared to say that when he is here 

addressing that question. 

 

I am here to talk about the 1992-93 interim supply Bill for the 

month of July which is now several days overdue, but we'll 

manage that somehow, and that's what we're here talking about.  

The member wants to talk about the GRIP program or the crop 

insurance program he will have to talk about that to the 

Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Rural Affairs both 

of whom are respectively responsible and ministers in charge 

of those programs. 

 

What we're talking here about, Mr. Chairman, has got nothing 

to do with the debate that took place on the ringing of the bells 

or the Bill that was being dealt with by the courts or the 1991 

GRIP program.  They've got nothing to do with interim supply 

which is what we're considering here today. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Look, we're going to come through this session 

tonight and the public will know.  And we can talk about that 

you will say it's going to cost us up to $300 million if we do 

one program versus another, and you won't even confirm your 

figures.  You've now said to me, you said this, tell me how you 

got it and tell me why it's three times 1992. 

 

Come on, you can't just say I didn't get it.  You've admitted 

you've done this.  You've admitted it's 300 million.  Tell me 

how you got it and tell me why it's three times 1991?  And if 

you can't do that then I know you made this up, and I know 

your lines about having to raise taxes are false.  And it's not 

true, like your lines were in the last election, we'll reduce taxes.  

You get my point? 

 

It's in terms of management.  And you want to talk about 

honesty and integrity and coming forth with one-twelfth of 

anything.  You do this few days before interim supply and 

we're not supposed to ask questions about it.  This is $300 

million; not bushels, not cows, not pencils, it's dollars.  And 

you're the Minister of Finance and you said it and now you're 

ducking and you won't address it.  And people are hurting and 

there's worry about drought.  And you can lever more federal 

money, and all you talk about is the American system.  And 

you're into one-twelfth. 

 

Well it's a sad day in this House, Mr. Minister, when you can't 

even share with your colleagues what you think will . . . I'm 

sure you must have told them in caucus some number.  Did you 

make it up too?  Multiply by three and then add another 50 

million and times two more and then say, well I guess we'll 

have to raise taxes.  And then when you get in here, oh no the 

number's right there. 
 

Well, Mr. Minister, if I could get your attention please.  Good, 

okay.  Would you explain how you got the 2 or $300 million 

estimate that you used to frighten people about the cost of '91 

GRIP.  Could explain that to the 

public. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, that's not relevant 

here.  We're talking about the 1992 GRIP and crop insurance 

program and that portion of which is under this interim supply 

Bill.  What the member is talking about is the 1992 GRIP 

program.  He's talking about some potential crop disasters.  

He's talking about the debate that took place over the ringing of 

the bells and the Bill that's before the courts.  That's got no 

relevancy with the interim supply Bill which we're considering 

here today. 

 

I want the public to know what this interim supply Bill is all 

about.  I want the public to know what the budget item is for 

things like crop insurance.  That's why we presented those 

numbers in the House today, and they are very clear.  The 

budget for Crop Insurance is $108 million.  We're asking for 

one-twelfth of that, and it's based on the provisions of the GRIP 

program as it exists for 1992. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Could you please explain why you wouldn't 

want to do 1991 in terms of the financial implications. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, when we get to talk 

about the GRIP program when it comes as a program to this 

legislature, that will be all explained.  We're not here to talk 

about the GRIP program; that will be done when that program 

is here with the appropriate department, the Department of 

Agriculture and the minister.  We're here talking about 

one-twelfth expenditure for interim supply for this fiscal year. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, again you are asking us to believe 

that your officials or at least your people or your office or you 

are entirely accurate when they put together these two different 

sets of numbers, two different sets of numbers.  And they're 

very recent.  You've got 1991 crop insurance would cost $300 

million more than '92, and that's financially impossible.  So 

either one of these is wrong; one of them is wrong.  But you 

didn't say the total would be 300, you said an extra, extra 300 

million. 

 

Now one of them is wrong.  Would you tell us which one is 

accurate and which one is false so that we can get on with 

interim supply and knowing what you're talking about.  Which 

one?  You've got a wide variation in numbers here, too wide for 

us to be comfortable with or the public to be comfortable with 

or taxpayers to believe they have more numbers, more tax 

dollars to pay for this.  And they're both your statements.  This 

one is out today.  This one was out last week.  And they're 

several hundred million dollars apart.  You got a problem and 

you have to come clean with the public.  Either you were 

stringing them on this one or you're stringing us on this one.  

Which one is accurate? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, the numbers we 

have before the House are accurate.  I want to tell the member 

that and I want to put that on the record.  We're dealing here 

with the appropriation for the 1992-93 budget, the interim 

supply.  The numbers are before the House.  The member's got 

them.  I've got them.  They're now on the public record and 

they are there for all to see.  And they are there for the 

government to be judged on later when this fiscal year is 

completed.  I'm not going to 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1111 

repeat the number.  I've already repeated it several times but its 

there.  It's before the House for consideration. And that's all I 

can say.  And there's no doubt about what the numbers are.  

And all we're doing is asking for one-twelfth of those numbers. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, you might recall the last 

time that you gave a budget in 1982 you ended up being about 

$400 million out.  The 1982 budget, remember that?  You 

ended up $400 million out.  Now here we are today, Mr. 

Minister, 1992.  You've got Estimates of Crop Insurance that 

are $300 million out in one week. 

 

So we're going to ask you which one of these is valid and 

which one isn't.  If you say this one's valid then the 300 million 

that you put out last week is not valid because you can't have it 

both and you quickly said well, I'll go with this one.  Well what 

does that say about this one?  Were your 300 tripling of the 

Crop Insurance expenditures just out of this blue sky and then 

the tax threats after that?  And if that's the case, that's not 

acceptable when you're asking for interim supply and 

threatening higher taxes if we don't co-operate. 

 

So in your last record, Mr. Minister, you personally were out 

several hundred million dollars and now you're out 300 million 

in Crop Insurance alone.  So you've got to say, if you think this 

is accurate, what does it say about last week's statement that it 

would cost us 300 million more to help farmers with 1991 

GRIP.  Would you explain that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, my record has to be 

the judge of whether the interim supply information we provide 

is accurate or not.  I'm prepared to talk about that record 

because the last budget for which I as the Minister of Finance 

was responsible for resulted in a surplus of $139.208 million. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- The next budget, Mr. Chairman, 

was something that the members opposite were responsible for 

and they ran a deficit for the first time of $227.175 million and 

it has never ended until we now face a situation where we have 

interest charges and payments of $760 million this year and an 

accumulated debt of $15 billion, the highest per capita debt in 

all of Canada. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Chairman, you see why we're worried 

about his financial forecasting.  In an election year, he forecast 

a $150 million surplus and he ends up with a $200 million 

deficit -- in an election year.  This time we had an election last 

fall.  What's he say to the people of Saskatchewan?  He says, I 

can cut your taxes, I can give you the cost of production, I will 

do all these good things.  And then what happens?  He comes 

in with a $800 million deficit, then his next budget is a $500 

million deficit, and today he's out 300 million in one program. 

 

Now you went back and said, in 1982 you provided the 

estimate and we provided the budget.  Well flip that around in 

1991-92.  We provided the estimate and then you failed to 

provide the budget.  So you have 

accumulated an $800 million deficit from '91, another $400 

million from '82 the last time you were the minister.  You've 

got $500 million in this budget and now we find out you're 

$300 million off on one number, one line in the Estimates.  So 

we're entitled to ask how you forecast in Crop Insurance 

because it has big financial implications. 

 

Now you've admitted, Mr. Minister, this for you is accurate.  I 

want you to tell us, then, what this is.  If 108 million is 

accurate, how do you settle that or balance that or reconcile 

that with $300 million in Crop Insurance if you went with 

another program? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I don't want to say 

this too unkindly, but it's really difficult to take lessons on 

accuracy from a gentleman who was once the premier and in a 

budget was $1.2 billion out on his estimate.  I want to tell the 

member from Estevan something that he should listen to with 

some care.  This statement that reported on the $139 million 

surplus was signed by his minister of Finance, the Hon. Gary 

Lane.  So it was not something that somebody from the New 

Democratic Party was putting together.  His own government 

had to admit to that because that's what the Public Accounts 

showed. 

 

(2015) 

 

In 1992-93, which was the election year, in 1992-93 which was 

the election year, was the members' opposite budget.  Because 

the member from Estevan, when he was the premier, did have 

an opportunity in 1992-93 to have a balanced budget.  He had 

an opportunity.  That was a choice he could have made.  He 

could have had a balanced budget.  He could have stopped this 

growing debt which has now accumulated to almost $15 

billion, $10 billion of which was accumulated during the 10 

years when he was the premier.  He had a choice.  He chose to 

do things like eliminate the gasoline tax.  He reduced the 

royalties during a time when the price of oil per barrel was at 

the highest level in the history of oil in North America.  He 

chose to bring in all kinds of give-aways and expenditures 

without any due diligence, without any accountability, without 

evaluating whether he was going to get value for a dollar.  

They spent like drunken sailors. 

 

In 1992-93 there could have been a balanced budget, but 

because of decisions that that gentleman made when he was the 

premier, instead it resulted in a deficit of $227.175 million 

under the first term of the Progressive Conservative 

government.  And it never, never stopped.  It never stopped. 

 

In 1986-1987 they predicted the deficit to be what? -- $389 

million.  Boy, that was a sound prediction for an election year.  

What did it turn out to be?  This is the man who talks about 

accuracy.  It turned out to be $1.2 billion, $800 million out.  I 

can assure the House we're not going to be out in that kind of 

degree because we're managing well and because we're 

providing a budget which can be defended. 

 

Now, Mr. Chairman, the member opposite can talk about 

accuracy all he wants.  But I can tell the member for Estevan, 

when it comes to accuracy he has no moral 



1112 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

authority to be able to talk about accuracy or accountability 

because his record when he was in the government shows that 

they were not able, under his stewardship, to ever reach an 

estimate that was made in a budget. 

 

That's one of the reasons why we are in the financial crisis 

which this province faces today.  That's one of the reasons why 

we can't make additional expenditures of money in all of kinds 

of areas which would be useful and helpful and would assist 

people, including the farm community -- because we're 

strapped with a $15 billion debt, a $760 million interest charge, 

credit rating agencies threatening to downgrade our credit 

rating, financial institutions and people who borrow our 

money, some of which will not look at our bonds if our credit 

rating from Moody's, for example, drops down to a BBB.  Not 

a creation of this government -- a creation of the member from 

Estevan when he was premier.  And this is the man, Mr. 

Chairman, who talks about accuracy. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Chairman, or Mr. Minister, in the last eight 

months you have run up $1.3 billion.  And we're asking you 

now . . . yes, $1.3 billion in deficit, $800 million in '91 because 

you wouldn't implement any of the programs, another 517 

million this year, right?  Well, what was the deficit in '91?  

Eight hundred million dollars, you said.  And now this year it's 

500 million.  So you're up to $1.3 billion deficit on your back 

right away.  On top of this now you're coming down with 

numbers that say you're going to be $300 million out in one 

program. 

 

Mr. Minister, all I'm asking you, as I did, Mr. Minister, over 

and over and over again, would you tell the public why you 

have two Estimates of what crop insurance costs that are 300 

per cent at odds with each other.  If you like this one, fair 

enough, would you then explain the $300 million difference 

here, so that we can look at the other departments which may 

have similar variations.  If you're 300 per cent out in one of 

these lines, how do we know you're not out on other lines?  

Because if you can go outside the House and say, well really 

Crop Insurance is 300 million not 100 . . . 

 

An Hon. Member: -- 300 million more. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- . . . 300 million more, then the public's going to 

say, well maybe he's wrong on Education, maybe he's wrong 

on Health, maybe he's wrong on something else.  And the 

Minister says, well fine, if you like this one would you care to 

explain to the public why you would tell them it would cost 

$300 million more if we had a different kind of crop insurance 

program.  And if you can't and if you fail to do that in here, 

then the public has to believe this isn't true.  And if that's the 

case, then they're going to be that much more upset in realizing 

you've taken away an insurance program for them that could 

protect them with hundreds of millions of dollars at virtually no 

cost to the Saskatchewan taxpayer.  Now wouldn't that be 

something. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, I come back.  Reconcile these two 

differences so that we can get on to other departments. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I'm quite prepared 

to let the public decide what they're going to 

believe based on the record.  I know what the public believes of 

the member from Estevan and his former administration, based 

on the record.  They showed what they believed on the election 

of October 21.  I don't want to debate the election because 

that's not what interim supply is all about, but I'll make that 

throw-away comment. 

 

The member talks about surpluses and deficits, so I want to 

respond.  I want to tell the member, if he will look at the 

budget documents he will see that on the operating side of the 

government this budget has a surplus of $242,000,940 on the 

operating side of government, and that includes the capital.  

His last budget, 1992-1993 . . . or 1991-1992, on the operating 

side had a deficit of $326.903 million.  The only thing that 

makes the difference is the interest on the public debt which is 

$960 million and so we're running a deficit of $517 million.  

That's the story on deficits. 

 

This is a major achievement that this government has 

accomplished on reducing the deficit from where it was and 

where it was going.  And it's an achievement that has to be 

made and an achievement that has to continue to be made into 

the years to come so that we can, in the next four to five years, 

get a balance in the budget so we have the flexibility to provide 

the financing and the funding for people's programs, maybe 

even reduction in some taxation if that's possible.  But we can't 

do that as long as we are burdened by ever-growing deficits 

which began in the first budget of the former administration. 

 

Whether you apply it to crop insurance or farm assistance of 

any kind or apply it in social services, the huge debt -- the 

member from Morse will agree -- the huge charges of interest 

on the public debt tie the hands of this government or would of 

any government until we get the finances of the province under 

control. 

 

The public believes that and the public supports the need to 

take some measures.  Now it would be very easy, member from 

Estevan, to do what you did -- spend, just no regard for what 

the implications are.  Just sign a cheque, put in a budget and 

then six months later bloat it totally different from what it 

originally was estimated to be.  That was the record of the last 

10 years. 

 

That's not what we're going to do because we care about our 

children.  We care about their future.   We care about the future 

of this province.  We care about the farmers.  We care about 

people who work in our shops and in our service industries and 

our manufacturing plants, and we showed how we care about 

them by getting the finances of this province under control. 

 

Because they know, and we know, and I'm sure the member 

from Arm River knows, if we continue to go along in the path 

that was there in the last 10 years, there would be a huge price 

to pay in a very short few years into the future.  Because we 

would . . . at the rate that the deficit we're growing, we would 

have in three years to pay a billion dollars worth of interest in 

the public debt -- a billion dollars in interest on the public debt 

-- before we could even start to ask how much money we spent 

on highways or crop insurance or social services or education 

or health.  That's why we have taken the steps 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1113 

that we're taking.  And I'm prepared to have the public judge us 

on that when that appropriate time for the judgement comes. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, you see the point that I want to 

get to is, you are telling the people one thing outside the House 

and another one inside.  Now that's what you did in the last 

election.  You didn't care to tell them the facts.  You didn't care 

to tell them the whole story.  What did you say?  And that's just 

what you're doing in here -- exactly the opposite.  And you're 

way out.  You said no new taxes; we'll eliminate the PST 

(provincial sales tax).  That's what you said when you were out 

campaigning.  You get in the legislature, what's in your 

budget?  Increased phone rates, power rates, natural gas rates, 

SGI (Saskatchewan Government Insurance) and vehicle 

insurance.  Increase in 1 per cent E&H (education and health) 

tax; new surtax on personal income, 10 per cent; increase on 

fuel tax, increase on tobacco tax, increase on 1 per cent in the 

corporate income tax, increase of 1 per cent on the corporal 

capital tax surcharge and an increase of 2.25 per cent in the 

corporation capital tax rate.  You wouldn't have got elected on 

that, Mr. Minister.  You wouldn't have got elected on it.  You 

said, no, no, we'll reduce taxes.  Now what did you do?  You 

walked in here and said something else, just like you've done 

today.  Last week out in the public where they couldn't get at 

you in questions you said, oh it cost us $300 million, you get in 

here and it's a third of that.  That's the point. 

 

Mr. Minister, you promised to stand behind rural people, 

Saskatchewan people.  You said you'd give them the cost of 

production, you'd get more money from Ottawa and you'd help 

them.  What did you do?  You eliminated the Saskatchewan 

Pension Plan; you have frozen and eliminated health facilities 

in rural areas; you cancelled the rural natural gas distribution 

program.  You've gutted the GRIP crop insurance protection 

program.  You've reduced municipal revenue sharing up to 30 

per cent.  You've got user fees for cancer clinic patients from 

outside Regina and Saskatoon.  You've reduced the number of 

rural municipalities; eliminated crown lease surface rights; plan 

to withdraw the election boundaries so that you can redo them.  

You cancelled rural distribution and fair share programs; 

you've cancelled the feed grain adjustment program; you've 

increased pastural rental fees; cancelled all the cash advances 

and you've capped the fuel rebate for farmers.  Now did you 

campaign on any of that? 

 

You said one thing out there and then when you get in here 

you've got your little budget and you say, oh well I'm really 

going to be helpful and you've got a completely different story 

in here.  So I have some motivation on behalf of the taxpayers 

who have gone through this to say, what is the truth and if this 

is accurate then what you're saying outside the House is 

completely false as it was in the election, so they bought a pig 

in a poke.  You did the opposite to what you said you were 

going to do and now you're not telling them the truth on 1991 

GRIP and there's tens of thousands of farm families who are in 

big trouble and you're making light of it, saying it's 300 million 

more than this one. 

 

And I can go on to the other promises you made outside the 

legislature, but you get back into here and it's a 

completely different story.  Funding will be increased for 

health care and education, you campaigned on and your 

Premier did, your leader did.  What do we see? -- user fees for 

chiropractic and optometric services; increased deductible for 

prescription drug plan from 125 to $380; removed diabetics 

from the drug plan; freeze on all capital projects in health care; 

cuts in funding of both education and health care; proposed the 

closure of many rural schools; rip up rural roads, the paved 

roads and turn them to gravel; increase air ambulance fees. 

 

Now, Mr. Minister, when you say all of these things outside 

and then you do the opposite inside and then we catch you at it 

within one week and you say, well I can't comment on that 

because it's crop insurance or it's health care or it's education 

and that's another portfolio, and you're out hundreds of millions 

of dollars, the public says, for Heaven's sakes, maybe this 

whole operation has just been a political hoax to get elected 

because they really don't plan on doing what they're saying at 

all. 

 

So you have here two Estimates of Crop Insurance that are a 

hundred million apart, hundreds of millions apart, and you 

won't address it.  And I'm just going to stay on that line because 

we can go through department by department by department 

where you've said one thing outside and something else inside 

this House, and then you ask us to support you and say, we'll 

let it go; I guess he's going to fund it all right. 

 

Well on top of that there is a crisis, and all I can say to you, Mr. 

Minister, you must agree that it's totally irresponsible to throw 

out numbers like $300 million and frighten people and not have 

the courage or the professionalism or the respect even for your 

colleagues to defend the number.  Please defend that $300 

million so that we can get on with this interim supply. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- That's the point, Mr. Chairman.  

That number and what the member is talk about has got 

nothing to do with interim supply because none of that is in the 

interim supply.  The interim supply deals with the budget 

request for certain amounts of money based on the budget for 

1992-1993. 

 

(2030) 

 

What the member opposite is talking about, the member from 

Estevan is talking about some debate that took place while the 

bells were ringing while the Conservative Party would not let 

the House function -- obstructed the process of this legislature.  

And we're talking about court cases, talking about Bills which 

were not made available because they would not let the vote 

take place, talking about 1992 GRIP programs.  What the 

member is talking about there is the potential costs of the 1992 

GRIP program under certain disastrous circumstances, 

something which the Department of Agriculture and the 

Minister of Agriculture will have to address in this House and 

they will. 

 

We're talking here about 1992 and '93 budget and the interim 

supply that is based on that budget. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, we're going to try this again.  

We're concerned about your financial accuracy because 



1114 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

we're looking at one-twelfth of your Estimates.  That's fair 

enough.  I think you'd acknowledge that's a fair question.  What 

are you going to spend? 

 

Now if this news conference where you did this . . . and you 

said there'd be a $300 million exposure.  You had an estimate 

of the crop and you used it.  All we're asking is how did you 

calculate that?  And you can have various scenarios. 

 

Today you could probably talk . . . and if I wanted to go say, 

what's your Estimates of revenues if sales tax is up or down 1 

per cent?  What is it if oil goes up 1 or $2 a barrel.  What is it if 

you've got a 25 per cent variation in crop production?  You've 

got that.  And it's only fair, if you're . . . if we're asked to give 

you leave to provide one-twelfth of your Estimates, to tell us 

how you're estimating what these programs are going to cost.  

So I just asked you a straightforward, professional question.  

To come up with the $300 million in the '91 program, what was 

the estimate of production?  How was it calculated?  And 

please explain to the House how it might have had impacted on 

your budget. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, the straightforward 

answer is that the Crop Insurance Corporation will have that 

analysis and the Crop Insurance will be able to provide it.  

Were I the minister in charge of the Crop Insurance 

Corporation and had the officials here I would be able to 

provide the answer right now.  But that's not the way it is.  I'm 

the Minister of Finance dealing with interim supply. 

 

I assured the member from Estevan on several occasions 

already that we will provide that analysis, and we will provide 

that information.  It will be done.  You will have access to it, it 

will be public, it will be brought to this House when the Crop 

Insurance Corporation reports.  I will in the interim try to get 

the information from the Crop Insurance if the Crop Insurance 

Corporation is not here for too lengthy a time.  But that will be 

provided.  I don't have it here because this is not the Estimates 

for the Crop Insurance Corporation. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, are you telling me in five 

days you've forgotten your own news conference?  You've 

forgotten?  I mean, how can we have much confidence in the 

Minister of Finance if within five days he forgets a couple of 

300 million and how he got it?  I mean you had a news 

conference on this because it substantially will impact on your 

budget.  And then when we ask you about it you've 

substantially forgot it. 

 

How can you forget how you got these numbers?  And the 

Finance people here, and they had it, they had all the 

information and Finance officials had prepared you and it was 

just last week.  And now you've forgotten how you calculated 

it?  I mean, we can't believe that.  And if you do . . . I mean we 

wouldn't have much confidence if you could remember, you 

know, the relevant information from day to day, and I don't 

think that's the case. 

 

So that must mean you don't want to tell this House how you 

calculated it.  And you don't want to tell the farmer how you 

calculated it because it might not be accurate.  Maybe crop 

insurance . . . maybe the '92 GRIP is a lot like 

'91, or '91 is a lot like '92 . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . hardly, 

the minister says. 

 

Well then tell us about it.  Tell us about how it works.  You just 

finished talking about it.  You said it's yours.  We know that 

you used the numbers.  And if it doesn't have any big impact 

then you could say, well let's go '91 and farmers could just . . . 

I'll tell you a sigh of relief would come across the province of 

Saskatchewan like you couldn't believe, Mr. Minister.  They 

just want to know what you're so concerned about.  And 

particularly if it doesn't have an impact on your tax level and 

your budget level -- this year it certainly won't -- then there 

really is nothing to be concerned about. 

 

Mr. Minister, this was five days ago.  Can you just search back, 

ask your officials, and I'm sure they were there, how you got 

the 300 million and what the production Estimates were to 

generate that figure. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I have no trouble at 

all providing that information to the member opposite.  But I 

will provide it when I have that information here.  I don't have 

that information here because this is interim supply.  I've 

already assured the member opposite that information will be 

provided and he knows that it will be here.  But that has got 

nothing to do with interim supply which is what we're 

considering here at the present time. 

 

I think the member has been pursuing the same series of 

questions all evening.  This is much the same like ringing the 

bells -- filibuster the House, take a lot of time so the business 

of the House can't be done. 

 

That's perfectly the right of the member from Estevan.  I don't 

object to that.  All I can do is say to the member opposite and 

assure him that the  information he asks will be provided in the 

appropriate forum.  We're not dealing with that issue now.  

We're not dealing with the crop insurance program.  We're not 

dealing with the GRIP program.  We're dealing with interim 

supply.  When those are dealt with he will get the information.  

As a matter of fact I've already indicated I will try to get that 

information even before so the member has access to it. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well all I can say to the minister is he must 

have thought that it would come up in Estimates or interim 

supply when he makes a guess that $300 million impact five 

days ago if you had to hang in there on '91 GRIP and today it's 

108 million on '92.  And obviously the 300 million is in 

addition to it so he must have been looking at a 400 million 

program for Saskatchewan people alone which is absurd. 

 

So we're just asking you to come clean and say and admit 

maybe you got a little excited, maybe you had a little bit of a 

political agenda, saying oh well, it would cost these several 

hundred million dollars, we're going to have to raise taxes if 

farmers don't back off their court challenge.  Now we don't 

think that's true.  We don't think it's accurate.  We actually 

believe if you did '91 you'd make money here because money 

would come into Saskatchewan. 

 

What if 3 or $400 million came into Saskatchewan this 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1115 

year?  $500 million.  $600 million.  Wouldn't you like to see 

that?  I'll ask the minister, wouldn't he like to lever money, 

would you like to lever money through crop insurance to come 

into the province of Saskatchewan like we see in other 

provinces that have a similar formula?  How much are we 

missing because you won't give us these numbers and you 

won't participate?  How much money is not coming from 

Ottawa because you won't do this? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I think the member's 

last series of comments are about as wild-eyed as the 

comments that the member made in the House in 1986, and his 

Minister of Finance, when they said that their deficit was going 

to be a $389 million and then out of the House after the 

election announced that it was going to be $1.2 billion. 

 

It's a question of credibility here -- your credibility against the 

credibility of this government's budget and how it's 

implemented and what the end result is going to be. 

 

I'm saying to the House, Mr. Chairman, the interim supply is 

based on the budget appropriations which have been 

announced in this legislature on budget day, which are in the 

Estimates, which are clear.  That's what the projections are, on 

the assumptions that I explained earlier.  That's what we're 

talking about here, Mr. Chairman.  We're not talking about the 

1991 GRIP program or what might have been the cost of the 

1991 GRIP program, because the interim supply Bill does not 

deal with that. 

 

I'm not going to talk about hypothetical assumptions and 

hypothetical circumstances.  When it comes to explaining the 

GRIP program -- and the cost implications of that -- I'm going 

to have the Minister of Agriculture do that because he is the 

person who will know more about it because he will have those 

officials here in order to be able to answer the questions. 

 

But I say, Mr. Chairman, this House would be far better served 

if we moved onto interim supply rather than some attempt by 

the member from Estevan to try to rationalize the kind of fiasco 

that he created in this legislature for 18 days when they 

wouldn't allow the Bill to be introduced for third reading on 

which there was a dispute, so that the public couldn't know 

what it is.  That's what the exercise is here about. 

 

The member opposite knows that the public has said -- and you 

take the front page of the Leader-Post today -- that the 

members of the opposition were, by 73 per cent or more, wrong 

in what they did.  So the exercise here today is trying to justify 

that. 

 

You don't have to justify that to me.  I know the process in 

here.  I know the theatre that takes place in here Mr. Member 

from Estevan.  You should justify it to the public of 

Saskatchewan.  That's who you should justify it to. 

 

There is a Bill in the court that the court will deal with.  Fine, 

we'll let the courts deal with it.  That's there . . . (inaudible 

interjection) . . .  Well it is.  Nothing I can do there.  You're 

also going to have it in here, because it is 

part of the legislative program of the government. 

 

And if you really are interested in it, let it be introduced so it 

can be debated. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Well, Mr. Minister, the reason that we're 

interested in it is because if you really believe that your 108 is 

accurate, why are you running around talking about 300 

million or more?  Why do you have to do that?  Why don't you 

just say 108?  Say 108, if that's what it is.  And if it is $300 

million, then explain that. 

 

The reason that we asked to see the Bill is we want to know 

why you want to monkey with the courts.  . . . (inaudible 

interjection) . . .  No.  We want to see it so that you don't 

tamper with the evidence.  If this is the kind of stuff, the games 

you're playing, why would we trust you?  Why would we trust 

you? 

 

If you don't want retroactive legislation and the public doesn't 

want it . . . All our research says the farmer should have his day 

in court because maybe they're entitled.  They signed a contract 

with Crop Insurance and it's worth X million dollars and they 

want it honoured, and you want to break it and you won't even 

explain why in terms of money and you're asking for more 

money.  It's pretty relevant. 

 

Mr. Minister, if your numbers are accurate that you're standing 

by here today, then why do you go out and triple them a week 

ago when you're talking about other programs, particularly 

when you know farmers are hurting and particularly when you 

know you could get more money coming from the federal 

government, and they know it, with 1991 GRIP?  Why do you 

say one thing in the House and another thing outside the House 

when it comes to $300 million in your Estimates? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, the member from 

Estevan talks about levering.  Well let's talk about levering for 

a while.  Let's talk about the success of levering, and I fail to 

understand how you use the crop insurance program for 

levering federal money.  If the member from Estevan can 

explain that I would be quite happy to have him explain that, 

how you use the crop insurance to do that. 

 

But here is the success of the member from Estevan on 

levering.  In 1989-90 the crop insurance program cost the 

province $19 million, the taxpayers of Saskatchewan.  Through 

the member from Estevan's brilliant negotiations with Mr. 

Mulroney, the Prime Minister, he managed to raise the cost to 

the province and the taxpayers of Saskatchewan from $19 

million to $108 million, which is the cost this year.  Great piece 

of levering that was.  Great piece of levering.  The province 

and the producers have now got to pay a greater share of the 

cost of crop insurance, a greater share of the administration 

because the member for Estevan said yes every time the Prime 

Minister said jump. 

 

And the Prime Minister off-loaded hundreds of millions of 

dollars on Saskatchewan of federal funding that the federal 

government used to pay.  Let's talk about levering.  Who got 

levered, Mr. Speaker?  I think the people of Saskatchewan got 

levered, because what happened, Mr. 



1116 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

Speaker, is that we now have an off-loading by the federal 

government of $517 million in this year alone on programs and 

expenditures that the federal government once paid because 

they were a national responsibility.  But because of the great 

leverage ability of the member from Estevan, the federal 

government was successfully able to off-load that on the people 

of Saskatchewan because we had a government for 10 years 

who wouldn't stand up to the federal government and say, 

enough is enough, you have a responsibility, carry it out.  So if 

it were not for that off-loading we would have a balanced 

budget this year.  We would have a balanced budget this year if 

it were not for the off-loading of the federal government which, 

Mr. Member from Estevan, you were so successful in 

negotiating while you were the premier. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, if you could get 2 to $3 for every 

dollar you spent, would you think you'd consider it, on behalf 

of Saskatchewan farmers who are in a crisis?  Would you 

consider that?  If you come up with 100 million and they come 

up with 2 or 300 million from the feds, would you consider 

that?  Would you consider it?  On behalf of Saskatchewan 

farmers and families who've gone through $2 wheat, 18 to 22 

per cent interest rates under your administration, and drought, 

and drought, and drought -- and they need help -- would you go 

three to one?  Would you go two to one?  Would you help lever 

federal money into the province of Saskatchewan that needs 

billions of dollars?  Would you help do that? 

 

(2045) 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, no I would not get 

into the business of auctioning Saskatchewan people and their 

tax dollars with a federal government who has certain 

responsibilities which it ought to maintain and carry out. 

 

The federal government has a responsibility for third line of 

defence which the federal government promised.  The member 

from Estevan knows that, that that was a promise that was 

made.  There was a resolution . . . I want to talk about whether 

the member from Estevan would do the right thing.  There was 

a resolution in this legislature early in the session, a 

non-partisan resolution which urged the federal government to 

deliver on that promise and that commitment of third line of 

defence -- $500 million. 

 

There was a good debate in the House.  The members of the 

government and the Liberal member voted for that resolution.  

The member from Estevan and his colleagues voted against 

that resolution because they want this government to practise 

the same procedure that they practised.  They practised the 

procedure where they spent money that they didn't have.  Why 

did we accumulate an increase in our debt by over $10 billion?  

Because the member from Estevan, and the member from Arm 

River, and the member from Thunder Creek, spent money we 

didn't have.  The member from Estevan is saying, spend money 

you don't have. 

 

We have a budget.  It's the best budget we could come up with 

under the circumstances of the finances which face the 

province today.  And we're saying to the federal government, 

we're saying to the federal government, you have a 

responsibility.  You have a responsibility when the 

farmers of this province have to compete with the European 

Economic Community and with the United States' treasury to 

provide the funding that's necessary in order to be able to assist 

them.  That's a national responsibility and we expect the federal 

government to carry it out. 

 

And other than what the members opposite did when they were 

in the government, we're going to maintain that argument with 

the federal government.  We're not going to back off because 

the Prime Minister says, oh please go away, I've got a different 

kind of a deal for you.  We finally have a government here 

that's going to speak for Saskatchewan.  We've done it.  We 

will continue to do it.  And the federal government is going to 

have to decide whether it has a responsibility, or face the 

consequences in the next federal election which is very soon 

coming. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, do you recall what you said in the 

1980s to the government of the day?  Do you recall, Mr. 

Minister?  You weren't elected during the whole period but you 

were about half of the 1980s.  I recall, and what you said is 

spend more on health, spend more on education, spend more 

for the farmers, cut the taxes.  And every time we come into the 

Saskatchewan Pension Plan or something else you said well, 

spend some more.  Do that and do that and do that. 

 

Now when we ask you to at least defend any kind of rural 

conscience that you have, to stick up for farm families and not 

only protect them in the short while but look at a program that 

was designed to protect them that you voted for, and now when 

you're in government you take away, you see why people are 

concerned.  You said one thing in opposition and another thing 

in government.  You said one thing outside the House and 

another thing inside the House. 

 

Again I have to remind you, you have no help now for farmers 

except it's the federal government.  In 1982 there's 22 per cent 

interest rates, no help for farmers.  It's the federal government.  

It's the same story over and over again.  So we're asking you to 

please explain your rationale for providing this program that 

supposedly costs $300 million less, rather than another 

program, and you won't do it.  You just refuse to say why you 

come up with one number one week and you come up with 

another number another week. 

 

Mr. Minister, if we look at the numbers that you could bring to 

the province of Saskatchewan by providing adequate crop 

insurance which is actuarially sound, you know that you could 

have one to two to three times as much money coming into this 

province, and you can balance your budget at the same time.  

You know that. 

 

At the same time you know that you have the opportunity to 

provide the security and the safety that other provinces do.  

What's the province of Manitoba done?  What's the province of 

Alberta done?  What have other provinces done with respect to 

crop insurance?  They're providing the coverage for crop 

insurance on the same basis that we designed it.  Levers . . . 

money coming in from the federal government.  You have 

denied Saskatchewan people hundreds of millions of dollars 

because you won't co-operate with the federal treasury that has 

the money to 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1117 

bring it in here. 

 

Now what that says to the people of Saskatchewan and it says 

here tonight is that you won't honour your national contracts 

and your commitments on behalf of Saskatchewan farmers.  

Well, Mr. Minister, if we look at the current safety nets and the 

comparisons of costs of current safety nets and the safety net 

GRIP '91-92, we find, Mr. Minister, that you can lever a great 

deal of money to the people of Saskatchewan, a great deal of 

money.  And if you're prepared to stand in the legislature and 

describe why you won't do that into some detail, then we can 

move on to Estimates, whether it's Health, Education, and 

anything else.  But obviously the people of Saskatchewan and 

farmers are very, very concerned by the fact that you will not 

even talk about it in here, yet you'll go outside the legislature. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, I draw to your attention . . . and we can 

provide you with the presentation of the new long-term safety 

net program and statistics which says that we can lever a great 

deal of money from the federal government.  And if you won't 

comment on them, at least I will have them here and we can 

use them to describe to farmers what you could have under a 

1991 program and what you could afford to do if you'd have 

the courage to defend the Estimates that were there, that you 

talked about.  Either deny them or defend them.  And we'd like 

you to defend them, Mr. Minister. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, if this process that 

the member from Estevan talks about, of so-called levering 

money, that is, spend millions from Saskatchewan, more than 

we've spent which we don't have, and at the same time it would 

balance the budget, I ask the member from Estevan to explain 

to the public and the audience that's watching on television 

why he was not able to do that in the 10 years when he was the 

premier. 

 

If this process is so successful and the model that we're 

supposed to follow that the member from Estevan followed, I 

say to you, Mr. Chairman, and to anybody who cares to listen, 

it's a model I prefer not to even consider.  Because it's exactly 

that kind of attitude and that kind of approach that has caused 

the situation where we have the highest per capita debt of any 

province in Canada, which ties our hands and restricts what we 

can do. 

 

The member opposite said that in opposition this government 

said, spend money on health, spend money on education, spend 

money on other things.  Yes, we did.  But what we said, Mr. 

Chairman, was, don't spend $1,000 a night on hotel bills, which 

you did, Mr. Member from Estevan.  We said, don't spend 

$3,000 a day on consultants from Margaret Thatcher's England, 

which you spent and wasted money.  We said, don't spend 

thousands of dollars on free booze delivered from the Liquor 

Board to your offices when you were on the Executive Council 

of government.  We said, don't waste almost $2 million in 

salaries to provide political staff for you, Mr. Member, when 

you were the premier, even though they did not work in your 

department; you seconded them.  Two million dollars a year -- 

that's how you wasted the money. 

We said, Mr. Chairman, don't sell the Potash Corporation at a 

loss of $442 million, which you sold when you were the 

premier, even though your own advisors -- and it's here 

documented -- said, don't do it.  Your own advisors that you 

paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to give you advice for 

said, don't do it because you're going to lose money.  And you 

made a political decision and you sold the Potash Corporation 

and you lost $442 million, which is now part of the 

accumulated debt of the province because there is no asset to 

pay for it, and the taxpayers have to pay for it. 

 

Well it's a very uncomfortable laugh I see over there, Mr. 

Chairman, and I'm not surprised because that is the record.  

That is what brought this province to the financial crisis we 

face today.  Now if the member wants to hear a whole litany of 

the millions of dollars that were wasted, we could get into that.  

We can talk about the Pioneer Trust fiasco.  We could talk 

about the Joytec fiasco where money was run off with friends 

of the government because your ministers handed money out if 

somebody was closely connected to you.  We could talk about 

the money you lost in GigaText.  We could talk about former 

cabinet ministers being appointed to trade offices and the 

federal off-loading.  We could talk about that. 

 

Mr. Chairman, we said to you in those years, watch where you 

spend your money.  Don't waste it.  Don't blow it.  It's 

taxpayers' money, and the chickens will come home to roost.  

They have come home to roost.  We have this debt.  We have 

this $760 million in interest on the public debt which the 

taxpayers now has to pay.  And fortunately they have a 

government in power now that's prepared to make the decisions 

that are required to be able to manage that and lead to a balance 

eventually. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, you must remember that you 

campaigned on the fact that you were going to reduce taxes, 

and you were going to spend more on health care, and you 

were going to help farmers.  Now I don't know, Mr. Minister, 

what you go through in explaining this to your colleagues or to 

your constituents or to your public, but when you end up 

changing your mind and increasing taxes and reducing the 

support for people, which is exactly opposite to what you 

promised to do, then the public has every right to ask you some 

serious questions.  And particularly when you said, well it's 

going to cost $300 million on one program when you're outside 

the House; and you come in and it's going to cost another 100 

million or only 100 million when you're inside. 

 

Now that reminds us of your election campaign because you 

wouldn't . . . you know very that people would not vote for 

GRIP 1992, and they wouldn't vote for the tax increases, and 

they wouldn't vote for all these cuts in health programs and 

education.  So you walked in and you told them one thing 

outside, and when you get inside it's completely different. 

 

And, Mr. Minister, you bring up something like . . . well you 

brought up GigaText.  You said it was about a 4 or $5 million 

loss.  The officials beside you will tell you you can 



1118 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

save 5 million a year if you'd even harmonize the tax systems, 

plus it raises you a couple of hundred million dollars.  And you 

won't do that.  You won't do that.  Are you considering it? 

 

He's smiling.  I think he's considering it.  Actually, it's a plan.  

He's going to harmonize because your own Associate Minister 

of Finance and your own officials say that was a good plan: 

one tax system, we pick up $200 million, we save 5 million in 

administration every year.  He said, oh no, he would not do that 

at election time. He had a better way.  Now he's into a situation 

where he's taxing people, cutting their programs, not defending 

farmers in a rural crisis.  And then he goes on, Mr. Chairman, 

and he says, well for Heaven's sakes, you sold the potash 

mines.  Well guess who nationalized the potash mines and paid 

way too much for them, and never paid them back? 

 

They borrowed a bunch of money from New York, bought a 

bunch of potash mines for 4 or $500 million, never paid it 

back.  When you put it on the market you find it isn't worth that 

amount and he says, oh we lost too much.  It's like the NDP 

bought a used car and they paid $500 more than the car is 

worth.  You put it back on the market and it's only worth $500.  

And they said, oh my gosh, look at what these people did. 

 

I didn't nationalize the potash industry and nationalize the 

uranium industry, nationalize the oil industry.  You know.  So 

we're asking, Mr. Minister, if you are now going to flip-flop 

back and forth in terms of what you say outside the House and 

inside the House, like you did during the election and after the 

election. 

 

We just want to hold you to it and say, why do you go out and 

say to the people of Saskatchewan that crop insurance is going 

to cost 3 or $400 million when in fact that's not the case?  Now 

that's what we want to know.  And the public deserves to know.  

And certainly the farmers before the courts deserve to know. 

 

So if you're not prepared to address that, then we will say, Mr. 

Minister, you have two Estimates of crop insurance.  You don't 

really care to explain the difference.  And the farmers will 

know from reading Hansard that you say one thing inside the 

House and something else outside.  And if that's the way you 

want to leave it, fair enough, Mr. Minister.  We can leave it at 

that and say you have got a variation of 300 per cent of what it 

will cost the crop insurance, and the farmers will know whether 

to believe you or not.

Now if you don't want to comment on this $300 million, then 

all I can say to you and to your colleagues and others is that 

there must be something you're hiding, or in fact you just don't 

want to address it because this was simply a political statement 

and it isn't accurate. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, I'll ask you one more time: would you care to 

justify, tonight, the $300 million estimate of the insurance 

program under 1991? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, we're not here 

talking about the 1992 GRIP program.  We're talking about 

here the interim supply for 1991 which is based on the budget 

which assumes the 1991 GRIP and crop insurance program . . . 

1992 crop insurance GRIP program, Mr. Chairman. 

 

The member opposite talks about saying one thing here and 

one thing somewhere else.  Well let me say for the record what 

this government said prior to the last election: that we would do 

certain things as finances permitted.  Make that very clear.  

Read the program platform of the New Democratic Party in the 

last election campaign.  And then, Mr. Chairman, we wrote to 

the minister of Finance, the member from Estevan's minister of 

Finance, and asked them to assure us that the deficit of $265 

million, which the former premier said was going to be the 

deficit, was accurate.  The minister of Finance wrote back at 

that time, in the midst of an election campaign, and said yes, 

it's going to be $265 million. 

 

Well, Mr. Chairman, it turned out it was going to be $930 

million, $930 million, just as the 1986 deficit of $365 million 

turned out to be $1.2 billion.  Now talking about some 

integrity, Mr. Speaker.  I won't go further than that as to say 

that that's the kind of shenanigans that you're not going to see 

from this government.  On the basis of what was inherited 

when we opened up the books for public scrutiny, Mr. 

Chairman, we discovered that if we did nothing, this year's 

deficit would have been $1.2 billion. 

 

Now the member from Estevan might want to stand up and say 

whether a deficit of $1.2 billion was something he would have 

introduced.  Well I say it would have been wrong.  Financially 

it would have been insane to bring in a deficit of $1.2 billion 

which was the deficit that we were going to have if we 

implemented the programs and the policies and the taxation 

measures that the former government left behind. 

 

It is true that we had to bring in some tax revenues.  It is true 

we had to bring in some tax revenues as well as make some 

program expenditures because we were not prepared to 

jeopardize the future of our families and the future of our 

children by continuing down the insane financial route that was 

being pursued by the members opposite when they were in the 

government.  We made the correction in this budget.  We're on 

the right track to balanced budgets which we have to do. 

 

All I can say about the harmonization which the members 

opposite talk about so glowingly as they seem to be talking 

about their record all the time, is the public of Saskatchewan 

spoke loud and clear on October 21 about your harmonization.  

I think the decision the public made was clear and unequivocal.  

We respect the opinion of the public. 

 

And they made that decision, Mr. Chairman, on the basis of the 

budget that the former members presented to the people of 

Saskatchewan which they would not allow to be debated or 

voted in this legislature.  They left this legislature in June at the 

decision of the member of Estevan, did not return here, did not 

call an election until October, leaving all that period of time for 

the province to run without any accountability and without any 

budget. 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1119 

Mr. Chairman, that's not going to happen under this 

administration.  We're going to have budgets, we're going to 

have budgets voted, we're going to have interim supply Bills 

when they're needed so that they can be debated in the House.  

We've been debating this now for several hours.  That's 

appropriate and that's correct.  And I'm going to answer the 

questions as requested when they are under . . . in the context 

of interim supply.  And we've been doing that; we will continue 

to do that. 

 

But when it comes to discussing individual programs of 

government which various departments and ministers have a 

responsibility for, I'm not going to get into that because I don't 

have that expertise and neither do my officials.  It is the 

ministers in charge of specific departments who do have to 

come to this legislature who will discuss that in some detail or 

to the extent of detail that the members opposite may request at 

any particular time. 

 

Now I want to say, Mr. Chairman, that why do we face these 

difficult decisions?  I already gave you some examples because 

of the kind of expenditures that the members opposite made 

without any due regard for the future, without any due regard 

for what impact it'll have on our children and their children.  

Never was that ever considered. 

 

That's why, in 1991, in the middle of an election, they sold 

Cameco shares and took a bath.  The taxpayers took a loss of 

$166 million, $160 million.  They didn't have to be sold at that 

time because the shares have gone up now.  They have gone up 

now. And if we still had those shares, the taxpayers could have 

got themselves a big profit out of them, but you didn't decide to 

wait that.  You decided to sell them at a loss because it was 

politically motivated.  It was partisan.  It was scorched earth.  

You knew you were down the tubes.  The members knew they 

were being defeated, Mr. Chairman, and they wanted to inflict 

as much punishment on the taxpayers of Saskatchewan as they 

could, and so they sold the Cameco shares once again even 

though their advice was not to do it. 

 

I've already mentioned the potash thing where they sold the 

Potash Corporation even though their advisors said clearly, 

don't do it. And I'm going to quote what their advisor said.  

This is from the Gass Commission report.  And it said, they 

said that: 

 

 The timing of the sale of the Province's shares in the Potash 

Corporation of Saskatchewan was contrary to the advice 

provided by the Crown Management Board's external 

advisors . . . 

 

What did they do?  They went to the Crown Management 

Board and other people and they said, should we sell?  They 

said, no don't because you're going to lose money for the 

taxpayer.  So what did they do?  They said, well we're going to 

get somebody from outside, some private consultants.  They'll 

give us the advice they want except that these consultants are 

pretty professional people. 

 

And so they provided advice to the government which said, 

don't sell because you're going to lose $442 million.  The 

former premier made a political decision, no regard for the 

impact it'll have on the debt or the deficit or for 

what impact it'll have on the future of our children and our 

grandchildren.  He said, sell because it's ideologically right.  

It's maybe financially wrong; it may cause severe problems 

down the road for the taxpayers of Saskatchewan; but 

ideologically I want it done. 

 

Now that was irresponsible, Mr. Chairman.  That was 

extremely irresponsible.  We're not going to be irresponsible.  

That's why we have here a one-twelfth request for interim 

supply because we want the legislature to appropriate that 

interim supply as it should be. 

 

Mr. Devine: -- Mr. Minister, in a week we're trying to find 

examples world-wide of this socialist magic that you represent 

by nationalizing industries.  And I mentioned if anybody would 

take over companies and nationalize industries and spend way 

too much they're going to get into some serious problems when 

it comes time to reconciliate with the market. 

 

I want to point out to the minister, you knew and we know that 

you can provide with a little bit of harmonization $200 million 

in extra revenue for the province of Saskatchewan.  And you 

know that.  And you promised not to do that, which would add 

another couple of hundred million dollars to the debt because 

you knew what it was worth.  That's $465 million debt and you 

campaigned on it because you said, oh we don't need 

harmonization. 

 

The debt we forecast was 265 with a balanced budget in '93-94 

with harmonization and equity offerings.  And you said we 

won't do that.  We don't need to.  And you knew harmonization 

was $200 million worth.  So that's 465.  You knew a couple of 

share offerings were worth another couple of hundred million 

dollars.  And you knew that.  And you just promised it and 

promised it and promised it. 

 

And you end up in a situation where you've got an $800 million 

deficit because you won't act on harmonization.  And you won't 

act on the recommended suggestions that we made.  And I ask 

the minister when we forecasted $365 million deficit of 

1990-91 were we accurate?  Yes, the answer is yes.  In fact we 

were better than that.  And we forecast 265 with a balanced 

budget in 1993 with harmonization and we're right on but you 

wouldn't implement it.  Did you harmonize?  No.  So you're out 

$200 million.  And you knew it.  You would be out $200 

million. 

 

Did you do TransGas equity offering?  No.  You knew that you 

would be out another couple hundred million dollars.  And then 

you put it all together and you say, oh well, we didn't 

implement all this stuff therefore there must have been a 

deficit.  And on top of that you accumulate on an accrual 

accounting basis every bus company debt or any other debt that 

you can find, bring it forward. 

 

Accountants call it the big bath theory where you use accrual 

accounting up to where you want to take it, take the big bath 

and then take cash from then on, which is unprofessional.  And 

they tell you that.  And you're doing it just for political reasons.  

And then we catch you raising taxes, cutting programs and 

backing away from helping 



1120 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

farmers and what do you do?  You go in and try to change the 

law retroactively to protect yourself.  And we catch you at that. 

 

And then during that process you announce to the public, well 

if we'd had to do this evil thing it would cost the taxpayers 

$300 million when the truth is it's only a hundred million.  And 

we catch you at that. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, you didn't campaign on what you were going 

to do.  And you said one thing different during the campaign 

and after the election and you said something outside the 

House that is different than inside the House.  So all we're 

doing is drawing your attention to it. 

 

And these are interim supply Estimates and we're just trying to 

get your capacity to forecast what you think you're going to 

spend.  And all I'm going to say, one more time, and I'm sure 

that you're trying to reconcile it, would you please reconcile 

these two numbers.  That's all I'm asking for the public.  Please 

reconcile your estimate of two crop insurance programs that are 

$300 million apart.  And that's just an estimate question.  It's 

one-twelfth of what the supply is.  Why is one accurate and the 

other wrong?  And it's both under your heading, both under 

your letter-head.  That's all we're asking. 

 

Now if you can't do that, fair enough; we'll just acknowledge 

that you will not address it and you haven't all night.  This is 

about numbers, Mr. Chairman, and we've been in here all night 

and he hasn't given us any numbers.  He says, well these are 

accurate.  Will you defend the numbers?  I'm asking you, how 

can you have two sets of numbers?  That's all.  We've been in 

here since 7 o'clock and you haven't given us any explanation 

at all, just rhetoric, or it's the department of this or the 

department of that. 

 

And yet, as soon as we're outside the House you're into your 

Finance officials and you saying, no, no, the real number in 

Crop Insurance is 300 million.  Get you in here, Mr. Chairman, 

where is he?  He won't talk about it.  So obviously he can't 

defend it.  That's all my point.  That's the only thing I want to 

do.  You can't defend the 300 million and you won't. 

 

Now fair enough, if we find that you can't defend this and the 

Crop Insurance people can't defend the 300 million additional 

cost to the Saskatchewan taxpayers, and the taxes are not 

connected to this, then your Estimates are coming back again.  

And you know that and I know that.  So let me just say to the 

public and to you, Mr. Minister, we hope that you can justify 

these differences and rectify it in light of what's going on in the 

public, in the farm crisis, and before the courts, and certainly 

this budget and the Estimates that are here. 

 

And we're going to give you every opportunity to do that, Mr. 

Minister, before we get through this financial session.  It's been 

a little disappointing tonight that you can't comment on them, 

but we thought being a week apart you'd know about them.  

And I just draw that to the public's attention so that we can get 

on with some sort of semblance of professionalism in 

forecasting how much money we're going to spend here in the 

government. 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I had 

not intended to get involved in the debate but, Mr. Chairman, 

after listening for 2 hours and 15 minutes to a charade which 

we call interim supply, I think, Mr. Chairman, that one of the 

advantages in having these proceedings broadcasted through 

via television is that it gives the public an insight into what 

actually transpires in this legislature and I think the 

exhibitionism that has been displayed thus far this evening that 

is termed interim supply, where there is grievance before 

supply . . . And the Leader of the Opposition has now for 2 

hours and 15 minutes tried to elicit some kind of a response to 

some very, very significant and important questions that we 

want answers for, because, Mr. Chairman, there are an apparent 

number of discrepancies in what the minister is saying on 

Monday as compared to what he's saying on Tuesday. 

 

(2115) 

 

Now we're being asked to give permission for the government 

to spend hundreds of millions of dollars of the taxpayers' 

money.  And we want to have answers to where this money is 

going to be spent.  And all we have received thus far is a 

display of arrogance and a display of utter contempt for this 

process by the Minister of Finance.  And I think the people 

who have been watching the proceedings thus far are extremely 

disappointed when Mr. Speaker made a very, very valid ruling 

this afternoon to bring this House back to work.  For a minute, 

Mr. Chairman, I had the disillusionment that we were actually 

going to accomplish some work, that we were actually going to 

get to our objectives. 

 

And yet we have experienced now a total waste of time by the 

minister who's dodging, and not so artfully, because it's an 

apparent display to all the people of Saskatchewan that he is 

just absolutely refusing to answer some very, very legitimate 

questions, some concerns that we have.  And you have not 

done that.  You, Mr. Minister, have shown that your 

government, with it's massive, steamroller majority, is quite 

prepared to be arrogant, quite prepared to be lofty, and quite 

prepared to say it's none of your business when we as members 

of the opposition here are questioning you. 

 

Now we have no intention, Mr. Minister, of holding up interim 

supply.  Because I think what we have accomplished tonight is 

to display for the citizens of Saskatchewan your total inability 

to co-operate, your total inability to be honest, and your total 

inability to be straightforward with the citizens of this 

province.  We are the mechanism by which this legislature 

holds you accountable on behalf of the taxpayers of this 

province.  And you have set yourself to course in the direction 

this evening not to co-operate at all. 

 

You hide, sir, behind the cloak that you are ignorant and that 

you don't know.  That's what you've been saying all evening.  

You've been saying, I don't know.  Yes, we're asking for 

hundreds of millions of dollars, but don't ask my why, I don't 

know.  Ask the various ministers in my cabinet and they will 

tell you, maybe, if they know. 

 

I know how this system works.  I know that you know, or if 

you don't know then at least your officials know.  I know 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1121 

your officials know.  You're not, I suspect, heeding their 

advice.  They're giving you answers to the questions that we're 

asking and you're choosing, quite purposely, to ignore those 

answers that the officials are giving you.  And what you're 

coming up with is a spin of rhetoric; a spin of rhetoric to try to 

fool the public.  And that's why I prefaced my remarks by 

saying there is some advantage to having television in this 

proceedings so that the folks out there can see and can judge 

for themselves as to the value of the answers that you are 

giving, whether you are being straight forward, forthright, and 

honest with the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, I have a few very, very simple, I hope, 

questions that you will be seeing your way forward to 

answering.  And the fundamental question that I want to ask 

you now . . . and I want to go back to the Saskatchewan Crop 

Insurance Corporation -- $108.547 million is the total allocated 

for the Crop Insurance.  Now one-twelfth of that comes out to 

$9.054 million I believe.  Now that's one-twelfth.  There's no 

extra expenditures, it's one-twelfth dead on.  And there are 

some obviously that are in excess of that, but I'll let some other 

members handle that. 

 

Why, Mr. Minister, I guess I would ask you, are you asking for 

one-twelfth of the total expenditures for Crop Insurance for the 

month of July?  And correct me if I'm wrong, but you also 

asked, I believe, for one-twelfth of the Crop Insurance 

expenditure in the last interim supply which was for the month 

of June.  Is that correct? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Correct, Mr. Chairman.  And let me 

just comment on something that the member opposite said 

about it is the business of the opposition.  I agree.  

Expenditures of the government, the Estimates of the 

government are the business of the opposition.  They're the 

business of this whole legislature because through this 

legislature we make them the business of the people of 

Saskatchewan.  But we don't disagree there. 

 

Where we might disagree is the long-established and actually 

very well-working processes that are in place in order that the 

business of the House can occur in an orderly manner and 

expeditiously be dealt with.  That's why we have committees of 

Finance where the departments and their ministers have to 

come to the Committee of Finance in this Chamber, and under 

the new rules even in other forums, to answer the questions 

with all of the officials who have the information to be able to 

provide it to their minister.  So we agree.  There's no 

disagreement here. 

 

Where we disagree is that there is somehow alleged to be a 

discrepancy in the numbers. Mr. Chairman, there is no 

discrepancy in the numbers.  The request in the budget for 

Crop Insurance is $188 million plus 647,000.  That's based on 

the 1992-1993 program as provided by the government, 

whether it's in Agriculture, Crop Insurance, GRIP or any other 

part of the government.  What the member from Estevan has 

been talking about all night is the 1992 GRIP program . . . 1991 

GRIP program; sorry, let me correct that.  That, Mr. Chairman, 

is not what this interim supply is all about. 

 

We're answering the questions here on this interim 

supply and the 1991 programs because that's what the money is 

being requested for.  The debate on the 1991 GRIP and crop 

insurance program is the one that should be taking place with 

the Minister of Agriculture because he's the minister in charge. 

 

Finally, Mr. Chairman, in answer to the member from 

Rosthern's question -- why one-twelfth? -- because that is the 

cash flow that is required for the Crop Insurance Corporation.  

One-twelfth every month, because that's what their request is 

because that's the way their expenditure patterns apparently 

require the money to be spent.  It's not like the quarterly 

payments you have to make in revenue sharing to 

municipalities or quicker payments that you have to make to 

the Department of Highways because road construction takes 

place in the summer-time.  But the Crop Insurance Corporation 

says they need one-twelfth appropriation for July, not any more 

than one-twelfth, and now that is being provided by the 

legislature. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Mr. Minister, what was the amount?  Now 

you didn't answer my other question and I'm sure it was an 

oversight on your part but I did ask you if, for the month of 

June, you had not requested one-twelfth as well.  Did you 

answer that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- The answer is yes, it was 

one-twelfth. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- All right, Mr. Minister. Then if one-twelfth 

was allocated in your appropriation for the month of June, how 

much money did Crop Insurance actually expend out of that 

appropriation for the month of June? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- We don't have that information here 

because you'd have to ask the Crop Insurance that question and 

we're not dealing with that so we don't have that information. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Mr. Minister, does this money not come out 

of the Consolidated Fund? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- But the money is provided . . . 

When the budget is provided with all the conditions and where 

you can expend the money, it is then the role of the agency, in 

this case the Crop Insurance, to manage the expenditure of the 

money.  The end of the month has not yet arrived, so we would 

not have the full accounting of what they have spent for the 

month of June but we provided one-twelfth.  They couldn't 

spend any more than one-twelfth.  They didn't request -- well 

even if they had requested because the House was sitting -- we 

could not have provided it to them.  So one knows for sure they 

are on target. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- You are making a lot of assumptions for a 

minister who is in charge of millions of dollars, hundreds of 

millions of dollars of this province.  So if you haven't got the 

figures yet for the month of June, could we back track to May 

or April or March to some point where you can definitively 

state that was the appropriation for Crop Insurance and that is 

exactly what they spent more or less. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- As I said the end of the month 



1122 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

has not yet been sort of passed so . . . I have no problem 

because they have to account for what they spent for the 

month.  If the member wants we will undertake when the end 

of the month arrives and the time it takes for them to report, I 

will provide you that information.  We don't have it here 

because the end of the month isn't here. 

 

The one-twelfth request is traditional.  If you look back over 

the Estimates and the interim supply Bills over countless 

numbers of years you are going to find it is one-twelfth.  The 

question that the member for Rosthern asks about, have they 

spent or how much have they spent of the last one-twelfth, I 

suspect that they probably spent all of it or most of it.  But we 

will get that accounting and I will provide it to you. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Like you say, Mr. Minister, you are doing a 

lot of suspecting, a lot of surmising with hundreds of millions 

of dollars.  I am just surprised that the Minister of Finance of 

the province of Saskatchewan doesn't know if the money is 

being spent that he is being asked for for these various 

departments.  I thought there would be a better paper trail for 

you and your officials that you would be able to answer that 

question.  I didn't say just for the month of June.  I said would 

you then go back to May, if necessary, or April if that is 

necessary.  Go back to a point where you do have that 

information. 

 

Let's bring this to a head, Mr. Minister.  What I am getting at 

and you alluded to it in one of your previous answers . . . I am 

not in crop insurance myself. I am a farmer but I am an 

intensive livestock farmer, and as such do not carry crop 

insurance.  But it seems to me that no farmer in Saskatchewan 

has ever lost a crop in May or in April. 

 

So the payments that you are asking on a nicely budgeted 

one-twelfth for every month of the year doesn't seem logical to 

me when we live in a province where you can start losing crops 

in July, August, and September when your heavy losses are 

involved.  So it would seem to me quite natural that your 

greatest pay-outs are going to be in early fall, late fall, and 

early winter.  So this idea of asking for an obvious one-twelfth 

may have been done for ever for all I care. 

 

All I want is an answer to the question.  There should be highs 

and there should be lows.  There should be ups and there 

should be downs.  What I am asking then is, if that money 

wasn't all spent in June, where did it go?  Did it stay in the 

Consolidated Fund?  Is it all shifted over to the Crop Insurance 

account?  What happens, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- No, the money is expended only as 

they use it.  The member . . . I'm sorry, I misunderstood the 

question earlier.  If you want us to go back to the beginning of 

the fiscal year and get that information together -- and I'll 

provide it to you -- I'll do that.  It's all public information and it 

shows up in the Public Accounts.  Nothing unusual about that. 

 

One may argue whether it's logical to provide one-twelfth.  It's 

been logical, and it's worked, and provided all that has been 

needed for as many years as there have been interim supplies, 

other than where there exceptions have had to be made in 

various departments.  And it works.  I can't provide a better 

justification than 

that. 

 

If there is a need for a higher cash flow later in the year then 

fine, the money will be there.  But the legislature by then will 

have dealt with the full budget.  I think no one will disagree 

that when you ask for interim supply one should only ask for 

the minimal amount that's necessary.  And that's what we're 

doing here.  And we're told by the Crop Insurance Corporation 

that one-twelfth is what the minimal amount that's necessary. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Mr. Minister, there's no devious underlying 

current that I have got here except for my own satisfaction. I 

want to know how that works.  So what you're telling me is, 

although the need hasn't been there, you have been requesting 

one-twelfth, and that the amounts that is available for them to 

spend has been accumulating so that there actually could be 

two-twelfths lying there waiting to be used but has not been 

required up to this point.  And if that's not the case, tell me how 

it happens or how it works. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, let me just make it 

very clear to the member opposite that the Crop Insurance 

Corporation indicates they need one-twelfth, but this is not the 

only month in which money has been provided to the Crop 

Insurance Corporation.  In the first special warrant for the 

month of April, the Crop Insurance Corporation was provided 

2.180 million.  In the second special warrant the Crop 

Insurance Corporation was provided 1.955  million.  In the first 

interim supply it was necessary for $9,053,917.  In the present 

interim supply the request is $9,953,900, the one-twelfth. 

 

So you're right, it does not always come as a one-twelfth 

request, but in this case that is what's required.  That's why 

that's what's being asked. 

 

(2130) 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Now I suspect there's a little bit more behind 

it than that, Mr. Minister, because you said to me that under 

special warrants you were only requesting one million, some 

hundred thousand dollars, which would be the actual need that 

Crop Insurance saw at the time.  Now you're just rolling a nice 

cozy number together and saying we'll ask for one-twelfth for 

everybody's budget, even though they don't need it because, 

Mr. Minister, I don't think that three months ago they only 

needed 1 million, and now they need nine times as much.  

That's what essentially what you're saying, is in the last two 

appropriations that we've done, you've been asking for $9 

million.  The special warrants, which you by the way said you 

would never use, you were only asking for one million some 

hundred thousand dollars.  So there's the discrepancy there, Mr. 

Minister. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I don't know what 

more I can say.  This is traditionally the way that the 

appropriation and the interim supply is provided, the 

one-twelfth. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Tradition has never stood in your way, 

Ed.  Come on. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well no quite frankly . . . In 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1123 

response to the member opposite, I have a lot of respect for 

tradition.  I think that this legislature functions well and has 

performed well for the people of Saskatchewan partly because 

of rules which we have written but to large extent because of 

tradition.  So I happen to . . . I want to say that very clearly; 

tradition is very important in the British parliamentary system.  

It's something like the common law.  It has served us well. 

 

Now from time to time, traditions have to be changed, and 

that's why you have rule committees that deal with this thing to 

modernize systems to this legislature.  But what I'm saying is 

that tradition in interim supply of providing one 

_twelfth as needed is something that has served us very well.  It 

served the former government; that's what you did, and it 

worked very well.  Nobody questioned that because at the end 

there has to be an accounting. 

 

At the end this legislature has to vote the full budget, and after 

the budget has been voted and after the budget has been spent, 

both the Provincial Auditor through the Public Accounts and in 

his auditor's report tells the public through this legislature 

whether the money was spent appropriately or whether the 

amount that was budgeted was spent.  That's out of the hands of 

the government: the reporting and the accountability.  And that 

system will apply to this budget as it has applied to budgets in 

Saskatchewan since 1905. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Minister, 

the last occasion your officials joined us for interim supply you 

stated that your government had completed polling in 

preparation of the budget, whose expenditure is represented in 

this supply Bill today.  Mr. Minister, please disclose who was 

hired to conduct those polls, the findings, the cost of . . . pardon 

me, the nature of the questions asked, and the cost of this to the 

taxpayer. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I have indicated to 

the House and I've indicated to the press and I think I indicated 

to the member opposite the last time she asked that under the 

freedom of information, because the request that was made was 

made prior to the budget and would have had to been made 

public prior to the budget, which would have been unwise as 

the members opposite have been very seriously complaining 

about providing information on the budget before the budget is 

introduced, we had to follow the section of the freedom of 

information legislation which said we will provide and publish 

the information 90 days from that time. 

 

So you will get that information at that time as has now been 

set in course under the provisions of the freedom of 

information. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Well thank you, Mr. Minister, I do know 

that you had stated in this House that you would do that.  I was 

just wondering when it was indeed coming, and you hadn't 

mentioned freedom of information the last time you were here, 

so I'm pleased to know that we'll be receiving it. 

 

Mr. Minister, your government has been in office for more than 

eight months.  What have you done to ensure that as much 

waste as possible has been removed before you 

chose and are choosing tonight to ask this House to grant your 

government monies that represent an increase over last year's 

expenditures? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- I'm not sure that that's relevant 

under the interim supply Bill, Mr. Chairman, but we've been 

fairly wide ranging so I'll try to respond to the member 

opposite. 

 

In the budgetary process we have reinstituted the process of the 

Treasury Board which under the former government literally 

did not exist.  The Treasury Board under the chairmanship of 

the Minister of Finance scrutinizes every proposal for 

expenditure that the departments come forward with and 

ministers of various departments.  We have in that process 

identified expenditures which in the opinion of the government, 

on the best analysis that we're able to get, was not necessary, 

much of it wasteful.  And so we have been able to eliminate a 

lot of expenditures that have made it possible for us to bring 

the deficit to where it is. 

 

That process is being refined.  The Treasury Board system is 

one which has been the envy by all provinces across Canada.  It 

went into disrepair for 10 years in the 1980s.  I'm pleased to 

say we're bringing it back again.  And as a new budget cycle 

begins to happen, very soon now we will be going once again 

through line by line of every expenditure on every program, 

every grant that the government makes in various departments 

to determine whether it's necessary to make those expenditures 

and whether those expenditures are being made appropriately 

and we're getting value for the dollar that's being spent.  It's the 

only way it should be done when you're dealing with the 

taxpayers' dollar. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- I'm very pleased to hear that, Mr. Minister, 

and I'm wondering whether or not your government has made 

any decision about doing productivity efficiency audits in 

terms of government agencies and departments like those 

currently being done for hospital use and for university 

programs. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Through the Department of 

Finance, the Treasury Board branch and the financial 

management branch, that's exactly what we do.  We're starting 

to do that.  We started the process in preparation for this 

budget.  That kind of evaluation and analysis is indeed done, 

and that's one way in which you can make sure that 

expenditures that may have been made at one time which may 

not be necessary now because the need is different, we can then 

be able to address that.  That system is in place. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Well I'm absolutely delighted to hear that, 

Mr. Minister, because it's the first time I've heard it here, and 

I've probably raised productivity efficiency audits five or six 

times in this legislature, so it comes as very pleasant news to 

my ears.  I am in fact wondering if you can describe to me 

whether this is something that's done internally or is this a more 

talked-down outside situation?  I would just like you to help me 

to understand the way in which your productivity efficiency 

audits will be carried out. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- The processes are internal, 



1124 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

done by the agency and the various branches which I talked 

about, often have input from the Provincial Comptroller who is 

hands on in the expenditures that are being made.  So it is 

being done internally.  But we have tried after the election to 

involve some external advice as well.  That's why we had Ernst 

& Young do an analysis of the affairs of the Crown Investment 

Corporation, the financial situation there.  That's why we had 

the Gass Commission do the work that it did, exceptionally 

good work I might add. 

 

We've tried to get that kind of input so that we could open the 

books, find out where we're at, and then get on with doing the 

kinds of things that are necessary to get the finances of this 

province back where they need to be so that once again this 

province can in the near future become an innovator and a 

leader of many things as we used to be in Canada. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Minister, 

bond rating services base their ratings on how capable they 

believe Saskatchewan is going to be in repaying its debts over 

the long term.  And in recent weeks these agencies have either 

downgraded Saskatchewan's credit rating or in one case they 

left it the same.  I'm just wondering if the failure to get an 

improved rating is an indication of the financial management 

embodied in this Bill that lacks a long-term financial strategy. 

 

I think perhaps I can state this question a little better.  I think 

that the bond rating agencies are really looking for a way to be 

able to determine whether there's a predictability to whether 

there will be a more stable income in Saskatchewan, and 

became very evident that it's not just on the basis of what's 

owed by the province but also how much economic 

development can be predicted for the province. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Absolutely not.  If the members 

want to read the statements made by the bond rating agencies, 

those that have reduced our rating and in fact Moody's which 

has kept it, one of the things that the rating agencies went out 

of their way to point out, and they don't usually do this, was to 

point out that the decisions made by the government and the 

direction that the government is taking with regard to dealing 

with the debt is something that they support and commend. 

 

And in my meetings, and I've met with them all, we have had 

long discussions about what we're doing and they've indicated 

that this was the right thing to do.  Their rating is based, and 

they've also said that in their press statements, on the size of the 

provincial debt which has accumulated mainly over the last 10 

years.  They are concerned about the size of the debt -- the 

highest per capita debt in Canada of any province.  And they 

are . . . they have been concerned as to whether that debt is 

sustainable.  Now that the government has made some of the 

tough choices we've had to make, as uncomfortable as they 

have been, they are saying to us, you're on the right track, and I 

think nothing more needs to be said. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Well thank you, Mr. Minister, but I think 

that it goes without saying, since a phone call was made to 

Moody's bond agency, that it is not just the debt that they were 

concerned about.  But it's also the kind of 

confidence that they have to be able to have in an economy that 

can in fact show itself to have some economic growth in the 

future.  And I'm wondering if you could just talk to us for a 

short while about the financial strategy and how it's perceived 

by these bond rating institutes.  Because after all, if they don't 

see that there's going to be economic development they're not 

going to see themselves as being able to be paid back. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- I can only, Mr. Chairman, I can 

only . . . and I have here the release that was issued by Moody's 

and I want to quote from what they said.  They said: 

 

 Actions taken in this year's budget suggest a commitment to 

restoring financial stability and accountability, although the 

former will require a multi-year process. 

 

We don't disagree with that. 

 

 Secondly, (it says the) government plans now seem directed 

at gradually reducing exposure to existing loan guarantees, 

and curtailing future government exposure to private sector 

ventures. 

 

And they have recognized that the government is doing that 

because they agree with what we have been saying.  And that is 

if you want to talk about economic investment, economic 

development, the creation of jobs, you have to create, to those 

people who will invest the money, the confidence that an 

ever-growing deficit and an accumulating debt, which is 

nothing less than deferred taxes, isn't going to, several years 

after they make their announcement, result in even greater 

taxes. 

 

Because we've addressed that question. We have begun the 

creation of that confidence.  We've recognized that deficits are 

nothing more than deferred taxes, and we've not only 

recognized it, we've been prepared to do something about it.  

We're getting recognition for that and we're getting recognition 

for that from the investment community with whom I have also 

spoken. 

 

And if you look at the . . . many of the analyses that have been 

made by Richardson Greenshields and all of these financial 

analysts and financial management people who do these 

analyses on provincial budgets, you will find that they say 

some very positive things about what we're doing here.  What 

they say is paid attention to by corporations and companies and 

by individuals who invest.  We've created the beginning now of 

a confidence builder which is going to show some dividends in 

economic development in Saskatchewan. 

 

The recent announcement in your city of Saskatoon of the 

uranium company -- Minatco I believe -- moving its head 

office to the city of Saskatoon I think is an indication that there 

is some confidence in the future of this province.  And there 

should be because I am confident in the future of this province.  

I don't think that there are any members of this House who are 

not confident in the future of this province. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Mr. Minister, I could not agree with you 

more that we have a very serious situation in terms of 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1125 

the deficit and debt that has a stranglehold on our province.  

What I'm really getting at here is that there are many, many 

people who would in fact agree with my statements that 

agencies would be far more inclined to feel secure about 

Saskatchewan if they could see some new and innovative 

economic development on the horizon. 

 

The Moody bond agency based its decision to confirm our 

rating at A3 from a previous one of A2 just prior to March 

because of what they stated was the high level of private sector 

debts that we have guaranteed.  And I'm wondering what 

contingency plans you've made in your government in case one 

of these investments falters and greatly increases the debt 

charges that we must meet within this and future supply Bills. 

 

I'm talking about the fact that instead of going from A2 in 

March, it's now at A3 from the Moody agency.  And I'm 

wondering if you could comment, please, on your contingency 

plan that you may have in place.  One of the reasons that the 

Moody bond agency stated what it did was because of the 

private sector debts that we have guaranteed.  What I'm 

wanting you to comment on is, of course, if in fact one of these 

falters, these investments falter and greatly increases the debt 

charges, what sort of contingency plan you have in place 

because you will be of course coming back for future supply 

Bills. 

 

(2145) 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, it's a perfectly good 

question that the member opposite from Saskatoon Greystone 

asks.  But the answer is that you cannot predict certain things.  

You cannot predict the level of forest fires that you may have.  

Or the conditions in the agriculture sector totally.  So you make 

assumptions which in the case of agriculture are based on a 

normal crop year.  You can't predict whether some of these 

enterprises are going to succeed.  One hope does and one 

should assist them to try to succeed. 

 

So therefore, you can't budget for the potential collapse of one 

of these ventures that we inherited as a new government.  But 

in spite of that, we have made a commitment that regardless of 

what happens, we are going to improve management of the 

finances of this province, get the finances under control and 

work towards a balanced budget.  But if you ask me as the 

Minister of Finance of the government how much should you 

put aside because you anticipate that one of these enterprises is 

not going to succeed, I'd have to tell you there is nothing 

specifically been put aside, one, because you don't know that 

they're going to succeed, and two, if you do that you're simply 

saying we have no faith in you and you're not going to succeed 

so we're ready for it. 

 

And unless we know for sure -- and that's why we had a lot of 

write-offs as you will find, as you know, when you read the 

budget -- that there's monies that have been borrowed or 

invested which we no longer can pay and therefore we've had 

to write them off.  We have to budget in this way.  So there's 

nothing put aside for a potential failure but we do have the 

commitment that within whatever may happen, and I hope it 

doesn't happen, don't anticipate it to happen, we're going to 

manage the 

finances and the budgets of this province until we reach the 

deficit in the next four to five years. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Mr. Chairman, I guess that's part of what 

disturbs me so much is that I do happen to believe that 

government should have contingency plans in place.  And I do 

happen to believe that in the 1970s when there were monies 

available in this province, had people felt that way, believed in 

that kind of thing, they would have prepared for worse times 

ahead and probably had more in the kitty and we wouldn't 

have, in spite of the kind of government we had in the 1980s, 

would have been able to have ridden through that a little bit 

better perhaps. 

 

Mr. Minister, a number of communities recently realized that 

they lost their revenue from fines when you increased your take 

of these revenues without warning from 7 to 25 per cent.  And 

cities also realized that as a result they may not have enough 

money to adequately finance their police forces by year's end.  

So I would like you to comment please what measures you've 

taken within this Bill to ensure that they do have enough 

money to offer police services and avoid a crisis in the next 

few months. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, this Bill, this 

interim supply Bill, asks for one-twelfth of the money that has 

been appropriated in the budget for municipalities, for revenue 

sharing and whatever other funding we provide from the 

provincial treasury.  So that's all is being requested.  There are 

pressures on the provincial government.  If we wanted to 

provide . . . We'd love to provide more money than we're 

providing but in order to do that we'd either have to raise more 

taxes or we'd have to borrow more and increase the deficit. 

 

Saskatchewan municipalities by and large are in very good 

shape.  They've got among the lowest debts of municipalities in 

Canada.  They've managed well.  That's to their credit.  They've 

done extremely well because they've run things efficiently and 

effectively. 

 

As we begin to get the finances under control and this 

provincial treasury has more flexibility to provide targeted 

assistance, whether it's municipal funding or whether it's 

capital works or whether it's . . . whatever the project is we will 

be able to do that in this budget, as we said to SUMA 

(Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association) long before 

the budget came down, and I think you will find that most 

people in municipalities will agree, we have to make the tough 

decisions now.  We all have to share in it.  And if we do that, 

then in the very near future, in future years, we'll be able to turn 

things around and begin to grow like we used to be able to do 

prior to 1982. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- I actually have just one final comment, Mr. 

Chairman.  Mr. Minister, you had indicated that we either have 

to increase taxes or decrease expenditures.  And there's one 

other area of course that would make a considerable difference, 

and that is to do the kinds of things that would increase monies 

in this province, and perhaps even bring more taxpayers here, 

or people who can pay taxes, and that's to do the sorts of things 

that we need as far as economic development is concerned. 



1126 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

I do hope that in future when you're coming back to ask for 

monies, that you will consider that there should be contingency 

plans in place.  There are lots of things that are far more 

predictable than one would imagine in Saskatchewan.  And 

when we're talking, whether it's crop failure, or we're talking 

about the kinds of things that we face more often than not, I 

don't see it as reasonable that there shouldn't be a contingency 

plan in place.  And particularly, when it comes to such 

enterprises as communities trying to survive when all of a 

sudden they're faced with enormous surprises, a 7 to 25 per 

cent increase in your take, is something considerable. 

 

And what in fact can people count on from this government in 

order to be able to run their own business affairs well?  If 

you're not going to be able to come forward so that other 

people can plan for and have contingency plans, what we're 

going to have is not just a fiscal mess at the provincial level, 

but the communities and the municipalities that you're talking 

about with such glowing remarks are going to be placed in 

great despair financially because of decisions that are made 

elsewhere. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, just let me indicate 

to the member from Greystone that this budget does certain 

things, although probably not as much as some of us would like 

or all of us would like, but this budget does provide for the 

small-business sector which is the main engine of job creation 

in this province, a reduction in the small-business corporate 

income tax of 1 per cent.  That's quite deliberately done to 

assist a small business in not only maintaining but creating 

additional jobs. 

 

We've said that we're going to take three years because we 

have to manage this.  We will eliminate the E&H tax on the 

agents used in the manufacturing and processing.  That has 

been welcomed by the manufacturing industry, the small-line 

machinery manufacturers, by the printers who are going to now 

be more competitive with work that they will be able to do in 

other provinces.  And they will be able to tender in other 

provinces to do that work because of their ability to be more 

competitive. 

 

So we've taken some small steps in trying to encourage job 

creation and economic development; more needs to be done. 

The government is working very hard in consultation with the 

business sector and the trade union sector to develop an 

economic development strategy which we will hopefully have 

ready later in the year because this is involving a wide section 

of people who are actively creating wealth in Saskatchewan. I 

think it's going to be a good economic development strategy.  

It's going to be a strategy that recognizes the restrictions that 

the province has from tax sources to be able to do things and 

going to have a great reliance on the private sector to do the 

important things that they have to do in order to create the kind 

of economic activity that we need. 

 

We'll work that out with them to the capacity we fiscally can. 

We will assist them but it's going to be a program and a 

strategy that's going to be carefully thought out. It will be there 

for a long period of time and will not be there for six months 

and then six months later another one is announced and then 

another one and another one because polls said that somehow 

this one isn't selling. 

You've got to be comfortable enough that it's the right program 

so that you stick with it until it shows results. 

 

And I point, for example, which I think is a great model, to the 

Regina Economic Development Authority in the city of Regina 

-- I commend it to other cities -- which has worked extremely 

well.  It is removed from the city council, it's independent, it's 

provided some funding, it's got people on it who know 

something about business and economic investment and they're 

doing a great job.  I'm not suggesting that that's exactly the 

kind of model the province is going to have but it's worth 

looking at that kind of a model as we develop what we need to 

in order to be able to get this province back on the rails again. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Minister, I, as 

well, have raised more than a half dozen times in this very 

facility that we should have a Saskatchewan economic 

development authority and I couldn't be more pleased that the 

province is considering this.  I too, believe that the Regina 

Economic Development Authority has a great deal of merit and 

I want to point out to you that small businesses of the 36,000 

plus in the province of Saskatchewan, your budget did nothing 

to create one job, one more job in any one of those small 

businesses in our province.  And when you're talking about the 

1 per cent increase that's not a 1 per cent decrease over the 

year.  That is a half per cent in the beginning is it not?  Is it not 

a half per cent decrease this year and another half next in the 

small business tax?  Is it a half per cent rather than a full 

percentage point decrease? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Reduction from 10 per cent to 9 per 

cent is a 10 per cent decrease, if you want to use the numbers 

that way. It's a 10 per cent decrease in their total amount of 

corporate income tax payable.  This year it becomes into effect 

on July 1.  So it's a 5 per cent decrease.  Next year it'll be a full 

annualized year but when you put together a budget you have 

to phase some things in as you can afford them.  We could 

afford to do it this way.  The reduction this year starting July 1, 

the next year it'll be for the full year. 

 

I'm not making a commitment that we'll be able to have a 

further reduction in the next budget, but I can tell you that if 

our financial circumstances are such that it would allow us to 

do that, I'd be the first one to want to do it.  But we're going to 

play it by ear.  We're going to watch it carefully and we're 

going to do everything that we have within our fiscal capacity 

to assist industry, but particularly the small-business sector, to 

succeed in this province, provide the services that they've 

provided, give them an opportunity to make a profit, but more 

importantly to create jobs for our young people in this 

Saskatchewan. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Thank you.  Mr. Minister, small business 

in this province works on the basis primarily of consumer 

confidence, of business confidence.  And the decrease that was 

brought forward I'm sure was appreciated, but of course the 

majority of people said was completely offset by all of the 

other things that had happened within the budget.  And I would 

simply encourage you, if we're in fact looking at ways to 

ensure that we can have some job creation in the province of 

Saskatchewan, to look at significant ways that we can have 

increases in employment in small business by even 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1127 

10 to 15 per cent in each one of these small businesses; would 

create an enormously different tax base in the province of 

Saskatchewan. 

 

So I implore you, in future, to perhaps work on a more 

consultative basis with small business to determine what 

indeed would be of great help to them.  And I didn't find 

anybody who actually knocked your decrease but I found 

many, many people who said that they were still in a down 

position because of all of the other things that came forward in 

the budget. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, I'm pleased to report 

to the member that in fact there is a consumer confidence in 

Saskatchewan.  And all of the indicators are that the consumer 

is more confident today than he or she was a year ago.  And a 

lot of that is because of confidence, I think, in the government. 

 

But putting that aside, there's other things that have been 

important here.  We have a much lower interest rate.  We have 

a lower Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar.  We have 

the lowest inflation rate in Canada.  We have shown in this 

budget that we are prepared to make the hard decisions both on 

the revenue side and the expenditure side to restore financial 

stability and financial responsibility in the province.  All of 

those things are important in consumer confidence. 

 

Consumer wants to know that his or her government is 

managing.  I think, and obviously I'm biased here, but I think 

that this government has signalled that we're prepared to 

manage.  It's much easier to do what was done previous years 

and don't bother managing but just respond to the polls and 

spend more money when the polls said you should spend more 

money here.  We're not doing that.  It would be nice to do that, 

but that would not be responsible.  We're returning back to the 

kind of good management that this province had in the 1970s.  

There were different circumstances there and it was easier, but 

just because it's harder doesn't mean that we shouldn't do it.  I 

can give you a commitment. We're going to do it. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- I agree, Mr. Minister, that it would be far, 

far better to have greater predictability, and I hope that this 

government will consider such things as a deficit reduction 

Act, a taxpayers protection Act, the sorts of things that will 

allow people to be able to make better predictions on how they 

can see their tax dollars used, and how they can plan for their 

own affairs, knowing that over a four-year period they can see 

what sorts of things are going to be necessary in adjustments in 

their own finances. 

 

(2200) 

 

And I'm sure you didn't mean to lay claim to a lower interest 

rate, or a decreased Canadian dollar which increased consumer 

spending, but I do commend you, as I have publicly at every 

opportunity, for trying to indeed get the deficit under control, 

and I have given you, just so you know, an A plus rating on 

increasing the people's awareness in this province on the 

seriousness of the debt.  That is what indeed I have done. 

 

What I have also done, however, is to point out the things 

that I think that this government needs to be very thoughtful 

about as far as job creation, and particularly economic stability 

and security for the future.  And if in fact you continue to look 

at the mechanisms by which we're going to have to address this 

only through tax increases or decreases in expenditures . . . 

And I think we could do better by looking at overall tax reform 

in a very different way and simplifying our system, as well as 

on the other hand truly finding with a fine-tooth comb the ways 

in which we can save monies in this province, and then spend a 

great deal of our energy looking at economic development. All 

of these things will change the economic picture of 

Saskatchewan substantially.  I do thank you for your time. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- I don't want to take time, I just want 

to make a comment because I think it's an important one, on the 

tax system.  I agree there needs to be tax reform.  There needs 

to be simplicity, more simplicity.  There needs to be 

predictability. 

 

The problem as a province that we face is that our tax 

collection, and the way we are able to set most of our taxes on 

the income tax side, is controlled by the federal government.  

We have to base our taxes on their tax regime and the way they 

put it together. 

 

The 10 provinces of Canada have been negotiating, and 

Saskatchewan has been one of the leaders in this, for a different 

system of taxation where we indeed could provide more 

simplicity, where we indeed could put more progressivity into 

the tax system.  And we've been trying to convince and 

persuade the federal government to allow the province to levy 

tax on taxable income, rather than base it on basic federal tax 

because that is a very complicated process, and you only have 

to look at the present income tax form to know how 

complicated it is. 

 

I am hopeful that we can convince the federal government -- 

and there's a meeting in September of this year in which that is 

on the agenda -- once and for all that they have got to stop 

selfishly protecting this system which is outdated and archaic. 

And if we can convince them to do that -- we have got the 

support of the other nine provinces -- I think we will all be 

better served. 

 

Motion agreed to. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As is 

required I want to move now that the second motion that is 

necessary dealing with the Consolidated Fund, and it reads as 

follows: 

 

 Resolved that towards making good the supply granted to 

Her Majesty on account of certain expenses of the public 

service for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1993, the sum of 

$365,428,000 be granted out of the Consolidated Fund. 

 

Motion agreed to. 

 

The committee reported progress.

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

 

Bill No. 31 -- An Act to amend The Tobacco Tax Act 

 

The Chair: -- I'll ask the Minister of Finance to introduce his 

officials. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: --  They are the same officials who 

are here, Mr. Wright and Mr. Dotson, the deputy minister and 

the associate deputy minister. 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Minister, 

when we last discussed this particular Bill some time ago, I had 

mentioned we would like some information as to your tracking 

on tobacco sales and the possibility that because some of the 

numbers were talked about that were fairly accurate as to what 

occurred in the budget, that your officials were going to make 

an effort to tell the Assembly what had happened in regards to 

tobacco sales prior to the announcement in the budget, and 

afterwards, to determine if there were any substantial changes 

that occurred that indeed, if we did have a budget leak that 

were impacted upon the sale of tobacco, that you would have 

some information at this time on that regard. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- The latest statistics we have is for 

the month of April, because that's sort of a time frame in which 

it works.  I'm informed by my officials that on the basis of that 

there is nothing untoward that is detectable with regards to the 

sales that were there.  As far as the projections that were there 

on the basis of this legislation, everything seems to be on track.  

There seems to be nothing unusual, at least that has been able 

to be identified, with regard to the sale of tobacco, cigarettes, 

and tobacco products. 
 

Mr. Swenson: -- Well unfortunately, Mr. Minister, the month 

of April won't do us much good considering the introduction of 

the budget and its timing.  I would have 

thought that, because they are an item that moves fairly 

quickly, that the department would have a more 

month-by-month analysis.  We all know there is a strong 

cross-border problem on tobacco products, both to the south 

and to the west of us, and that your department would have 

some month-by-month details that might be more up to date 

since the budget. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, there is the lag 

structure in this, and we're only now beginning to get the 

results for the month of May.  But I have reported to you on the 

month of April. There's nothing unusual there.  We'll be able to 

report to the House, to the minister, and in Estimates we can 

talk about it some more, on what we find for the month of May.  

No problem with doing that, and I will do that when we get 

those numbers and those statistics come in. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- How soon will that occur, Mr. Minister?  Is 

that something that you would normally have on a quarterly 

basis or would you have that fairly quick in the month of July? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- No, they are monthly statistics.  It's 

just that there is a month lag in those statistics.  So therefore 

because of that, we have April; we don't yet have May; but we 

will have the May numbers coming in about now and 

somewhere down the road, in a couple of weeks or so, I suspect 

we will be able to provide that information. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- While you're doing that, Mr. Minister, I 

wonder if you could include your projections.  I think you 

outlined them earlier on but as to what type of revenue you 

would be garnering on a month-by-month basis with this 

particular tax. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 2 and 3 agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

(2215) 

 

Bill No. 43 -- An Act to repeal The Hospitals Tax Act and 

respecting certain consequential amendments resulting 

from the repeal of that Act 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Mr. Chairman, if the minister might, just for 

the benefit of the House, give a small explanation of exactly 

what is going on here.  I'm not, quite frankly, clear in my mind 

exactly what we're accomplishing here, and I wonder if he 

would mind giving a little more background. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, this is simply 

cleaning up the legislation with regard to The Hospital Tax Act 

wherein, I believe it was 1989, there was through The Hospital 

Tax Act a tax on certain gaming activities such as lottery 

tickets, bingos, raffles, and so on that was introduced by the 

former administration.  But it was cancelled by the former 

administration after some considerable public concern.  And all 

that this Bill by-and-large does is removes that provision from 

the 



June 29, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 1129 

legislation itself. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Mr. Minister, how much money was collected 

under that particular tax in that fiscal year? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- For the period July 1, 1989 to 

November 17, 1989, $8,302,442.63. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- The projections, Mr. Minister, that the 

government has done on the video lotteries and similar-type 

gaming operations, are they based somewhat on the experience 

of this lottery tax?  Or some of the projections that you've done 

for budget purposes, was this any type of an indicator that 

would tell you what your revenue potential was? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- I am told very indirectly. I'm not 

the minister in charge of the Gaming Commission that deals 

with these kinds of things but the answer to the question is in 

an indirect way, yes.  But I'm sure that the minister in charge of 

the Gaming Commission will probably be able to get you more 

specific information at the time when that commission is before 

the legislature. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 2 to 4 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 29 -- An Act to amend The Education and Health 

Tax Act 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Minister, in 

moving the sales tax from 7 per cent to 8, what have been your 

. . . And once again I suspect that you're going to tell me that 

you don't have any tracking on this, that simply will have 

April's numbers which wouldn't apply.  Do you have an 

estimate what has happened in the month of May since the 

introduction of this particular budget item and the impact that 

this has had on the retail sales area of Saskatchewan? 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Mr. Chairman, once again we have 

the same circumstance here as with the tobacco tax.  There is 

this one month lag in order to be able to provide the 

information.  The early indications are that everything is on 

track.  The Estimates of the amount of revenues that we 

expected from this tax measure are coming through.  There 

seems to be, because of other reasons such as the low interest 

rate which we talked about earlier and growing, I think, 

confidence by the consumer, that the retail sales seem to be 

holding up fairly well. 

 

So we have no reason to believe other than things, the 

projections that were made from the point of view of revenues, 

are going to hold.  But I will be more accurate in this when we 

have got the May receipts accounted for.  And because of the 

one month lag situation that exists here, we won't be able to 

know that until that was complete. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Mr. Minister, you were very quick as a new 

government to come up with all sorts of facts and 

figures as to the ramifications of harmonization and it's impact 

on the retail sector, particularly in Saskatchewan; the job loss 

that would be associated with it, the amount of money that 

would go out of the Saskatchewan economy.  I'm sure in 

contemplating these changes to the E&H tax that similar type 

of surveys must have been done by your department before 

implementation of this particular item.  And I wonder if you 

would mind sharing those with the Assembly; showing us what 

your projections are, total income and that type of thing, and 

what the impact would be on the Saskatchewan economic 

sector. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, the difference 

between that 1 cent increase on the existing provincial E&H 

tax and the harmonization was that the provincial E&H tax is 

relatively a narrow-based tax system; a narrow, small, select 

number of items.  Harmonization applied the tax on everything 

other than prescription drugs and groceries, and in fact beyond 

goods it also included services.  So the impact of that was very 

significant. 

 

We have not done an analysis of each individual tax.  As such 

we've done a macro-analysis of the impact it would have and 

we already discussed that under different debates in this 

legislature.  We've determined that in spite of the increase in 

the tax, and in spite of the program reductions, and the 

reduction in the expenditures we've had to incur, there is going 

to be at least a break even in the economy; it'll hold its own.  

We expect a net increase in jobs of some 2,000.  That is being 

supported by independent analysts and agencies who -- the 

Conference Board of Canada, for example -- who have 

indicated . . . the real estate dealers association . . .  It's 

confirmed those Estimates.  But as to what impact the 1 cent 

increase will have, we don't have that kind of an analysis to 

provide to the House. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Mr. Minister, as we discussed earlier in this 

House, I think the things that you mention are more by good 

luck than good management.  I mean obviously the federal 

monetary policy, as far as home building and some of the other 

areas of our economy, are more national in scope than they are 

pronouncements from the Government of Saskatchewan.  And 

I can appreciate your optimism but I don't think you quite 

rightly can deserve the credit for some of those things.  I mean, 

Crown Life coming to Regina had very little to do with the 

current Minister of Finance and its impact on the Regina 

housing market. 

 

So I think if you had the time and the ability to do analysis as 

to the impacts of harmonization, I would have thought with a 

major tax move such as this that one would have . . . Given the 

pressures particularly, Minister, that this province has with 

cross-border shopping on all three sides of us, the potential for 

job loss, the potential for people to go to Alberta to buy their 

goods, people go to the United States, people go to Montana, 

go to Manitoba, that you would have wanted to take that into 

consideration before risking a further tax hike which might 

harm people in those particular jurisdictions. 

 

And just because the federal monetary policy and the former 

government helped you with a housing spurt in 



1130 Saskatchewan Hansard June 29, 1992 

the city of Regina and perhaps in Saskatoon, that you would be 

concerned about the Kindersleys and the Unitys and the Swift 

Currents and the Shaunavons and the Estevans and the 

Moosomins of the world who are directly impacted any time 

that their ability to compete with similar jurisdictions is 

affected and certainly I would think that merchants in all of 

those areas would be facing a tougher time today than they did 

at 7 per cent when they said it was onerous. 

 

So I would ask you once more, given the fact that so many 

communities in our province and so many people are impacted 

when their competitive position is lessened that you would 

have taken that into consideration and that there would be net 

losses occurring and I would just like you to inform the House 

what that analysis and those net losses might be. 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: -- Clearly, Mr. Chairman, we took it 

into consideration and when one balances other things in other 

provinces against the tax situation in Saskatchewan, the 

conclusion has to be that although, clearly we as everywhere 

else in Canada the tax is higher than most people would like, 

we balance off fairly well. 

 

Although we may have an 8 per cent sales tax now on a narrow 

list of goods, narrower than most other provinces in Canada, 

we have other advantages.  We have the lowest housing in 

Canada, lower than either Alberta or Manitoba by some 

considerable margin.  We have lower utility rates, we have no 

health premiums, we have no payroll taxes as do exist in other 

provinces.  When you evaluate and make comparisons you 

have to compare all of the debts, the taxes, the service charges 

and utility charges, cost of living which is the lowest increase 

in all of Canada as well.  On the basis of that measurement 

Saskatchewan comes off pretty well. 

 

The other thing that we could have done which would have 

really had a negative impact is continue to have the kind of 

growth in deficits and the debt which we would have had if we 

had not come to grips with this situation.  So that is the positive 

side which mitigates against what obviously is a negative thing 

every time you do an increase in the tax.  So I think the balance 

is really quite good. 

 

The other thing about the sales tax, although when you raise it 

by 1 cent on that narrow base that we have it does have a 

negative impact, there's also the positive impact, is that 

non-residents who travel through Saskatchewan or come up 

here contribute to the economy which otherwise they would 

not.  That's significant as well. 

 

So I think on balance, Mr. Chairman, clearly it comes off pretty 

good.  We were confident when we made those kinds of 

comparisons that it is a tax change that we could put into place.  

Admittedly there are some difficulties but over time as we get 

the finances of the province under control, we've started that 

trend, we'll be able to deal with those difficulties and begin to 

resolve them. 

 

The committee reported progress.
