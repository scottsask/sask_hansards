the spread of the highly addictive drug, crystal 
methamphetamine. 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to cause this government to take 
the necessary action to implement a strategy that will deal 
with crystal methamphetamine education, prevention, 
enforcement, and treatment. 
 

The people that have signed this petition are all from Wadena. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

be unfairly burdened by their share of school taxes. The prayer 
of the petition reads: 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to cause the provincial 
government to take all necessary action to reverse charges 
recently made that require the education sector to 
contribute to the cost of SAMA, as this added burden for 
school boards will ultimately lead to higher property taxes 
for Saskatchewan residents. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
Mr. Speaker, the signatures on this petition come from the 
communities of Milden, Wiseton, and Dinsmore. And I’m

amalgamation of school divisions in Saskatchewan and 
continue reorganization of school divisions on a strictly 
voluntary basis. 
 

And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, this is signed by folks from Regina, Halbrite, 
and Midale. I so present. Thank you.

agricultural income stabilization] program. And the prayer 
reads: 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to cause the government to take 
the necessary action to ensure that the CAIS program 
receives adequate provincial funding, the funding formula 
is changed to ensure equal access to compensation, and to 
contribute funds to the latest BSE assistance package 
released by the federal government. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
And this petition is signed by residents of Pangman, Radville, 
Yellow Grass, Bengough, Lafleche, and Weyburn. I so present.

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to cause the provincial 
government to take all the necessary actions to install the 
technical equipment necessary to ensure that all rural areas 
of Saskatchewan are protected for reliable cellular phone 
coverages. 
 
In duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 
 

Signed by the good citizens from Jansen and Yorkton. I so 
present. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Biggar.

Assembly may be pleased to cause the government to take 
the necessary steps to ensure that the Biggar Hospital, 
long-term care home, and ambulance services maintain at 
the very least their current level of services. 
 
As in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 
 

Signed by the good citizens of Landis and Perdue. I so present.

and where were these funds directed to? 
 

I so present. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Wascana. 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s indeed a 
pleasure for me to introduce to you and through you to all 
members of the Assembly a group of University of Regina 
students who recently travelled to New York City and they took 
part in the International Model UN [United Nations] 
Conference that was held at the General Assembly Hall. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d ask them to stand as I introduce them so that 
all members can acknowledge them here today. We have with 
us in your gallery, Mr. Speaker, Terin O’How, David Froh, 
Kashif Ahmed, Christa Ross. And next to Christa, we have 
Jennifer Soloway and Jennifer today is accompanied by her 
dad, Bob Adams. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I was able to travel a short part of the way with 
them on their journey and they were very excited and were, I 
think, keen to represent us very well at the United Nations 
conference. 
 
And they’re able to come and watch part of the proceedings 
today and then I’ll join them for refreshments and some 
questions following question period. I’d ask all members to join 
me in welcoming the students from the University of Regina 
and Bob Adams. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Mr. Speaker, while I’m still on my feet, I 
wanted to also introduce to you . . . a little bit behind the clock 
this morning, but if Rhiannon Stromberg would stand up. Today 
is the last day that she’ll join me on our side of the Assembly 
for the internship program. I’ve enjoyed working with 
Rhiannon over the last number of months and I think both of us 
can’t believe how quickly the time has gone. 
 
As we all know, Rhiannon will be joining a member opposite to 
shadow their experience from the opposition point of view, and 
I know she’ll learn from both experiences. So I’d ask all 
members to give Rhiannon a warm welcome this morning. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It gives me great 
pleasure to introduce a couple that I have worked with or met a 
few years ago now and worked with on a number of issues. And 
seated in your gallery, from Glidden, Saskatchewan, is Terry 
and Carla Motz. And accompanying them today is a friend of 
theirs, right here from Regina, Lynn McCaslin. So I would 
welcome all members to join me in welcoming them to their 
legislature. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Coronation Park. 



April 14, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2517 

Mr. Trew: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s 
seldom so much fun as it is for me for today and it’s seldom 
such an honour as it is for me today to single out one person out 
of the United Nations model parliament. And that’s Terin 
O’How. 
 
I’ve come to know Terin reasonably well over the last number 
of months as a university student with a very keen interest in 
our world, and a very good understanding of government and 
governance. And I want to just say that Terin epitomizes 
tomorrow’s leadership today. She’s very talented, very bright. 
And I’m pleased to report that our son Brad has a very special 
interest in Terin O’How, and my wife Lorna and I are even 
more pleased to report that Terin O’How seems to reciprocate 
this very special interest in our son Brad. So I ask all hon. 
members to join me in a very special welcome to Terin O’How. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 
through you to the Assembly, the official opposition would also 
like to welcome the students from the U of R [University of 
Regina] who participated in the UN program, and their 
professor. Participation with the UN and other exchange 
programs such as that are an excellent learning tool and gives 
students and the rest of us — who then have the chance to 
associate and talk with those students — an understanding of 
what is happening in their world and what they have seen and 
can pass on to us. 
 
Just as a point of interest, Mr. Speaker, I’d also like to point out 
the young gentleman sitting in the middle there was a 
participant in the Pakistani-Canadian cultural event that 
occurred here on Saturday night, and he did a very good job as 
a fashion model, Mr. Speaker. Welcome to everyone. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member from 
Meadow Lake. 
 

2005 Centennial Cup Hockey Challenge 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
suspect even from where you sit, Mr. Speaker, you will note I 
have on my Don Cherry tie today. I also tried to, I tried to 
complete my ensemble, Mr. Speaker, by borrowing the shirt 
from the member from Carrot River the other day, that bright 
yellow one, to complete my ensemble, but we couldn’t 
coordinate that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by saying: so tonight, live from the 
civic centre in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker, it’s 
the 2005 Centennial Cup Hockey Challenge. 
 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, hockey is Canada’s most popular 
sport, and as history can confirm, Saskatchewan and Alberta 
have been large contributors to the game. Tonight as part of our 

centennial celebration Saskatchewan will battle Alberta for the 
Centennial Challenge Cup trophy. Mr. Speaker, the game has 
generated a great deal of interest in both provinces. In fact it 
took only one day for the game to sell out, Mr. Speaker. 
 
CBC [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation] will be broadcasting 
the game live on radio and television to both Saskatchewan and 
Alberta. Ron MacLean of Hockey Night in Canada will be the 
MC [master of ceremonies] for the big game. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the game will feature some of the Western Hockey 
League’s finest major junior players, with Saskatchewan-based 
players taking on their Alberta counterparts. The Centennial 
Hockey Challenge was made possible through a partnership 
between Saskatchewan Centennial 2005, Alberta Centennial, 
the WHL [Western Hockey League], and CBC. Proceeds from 
the event will go towards the WHL Educational Fund, the 
Hockey Alberta Foundation, and the Saskatchewan Hockey 
Association Legacy Fund, thereby ensuring the legacy of 
excellent Saskatchewan hockey continues through our next 100 
years, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Saskatchewan and Alberta MLAs [Member of 
the Legislative Assembly] will both be there to cheer on their 
respective teams, but I am confident, Mr. Speaker, that Team 
Saskatchewan will emerge as winners of the Centennial 
Challenge Cup. Thank you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the for Biggar. 
 

Recognition of Wilkie Centenarians 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last Saturday I had 
the great pleasure to present Saskatchewan centennial medals to 
two centenarians in Wilkie. The first presentation took place at 
Poplar Courts. The family of Ester Wolf came from all over 
Saskatchewan to be on hand. Mrs. Wolf was born in Dayton, 
Ohio 104 years ago. She came to Saskatchewan in 1914 with 
her family. Mrs. Wolf lived on her own until she was 99 years 
old and continued to play the piano and sing hymns up until two 
years ago. The Wilkie Press was on hand to take pictures of the 
presentation. Everyone enjoyed coffee and lunch while 
reminiscing about the past century. 
 
The next presentation took place at the residence of Mrs. 
Florantina Ziegler. Mrs. Ziegler treated her neighbour and me to 
tea, cinnamon rolls, and old-time ammonia peppermint cookies 
which she had baked. While enjoying her baking, we talked 
about her life. Mrs. Ziegler was born 102 years ago. She spends 
her winters in British Columbia with family, and she just 
returned to Saskatchewan a few days before. Mrs. Ziegler 
remembers well the Regina cyclone and devastation it brought. 
The great flu epidemic of 1918 is vivid in her memory. Her 
father operated a taxi service with a team of horses and helped 
many sick people, without coming down with the flu. Mrs. 
Ziegler still owns an Eaton’s wringer washer and is looking 
forward to warm spring temperatures when she will plant her 
garden, which takes up the whole backyard.

2518 Saskatchewan Hansard April 14, 2005 

Please join me in congratulating these two wonderful 
centenarians who played such an important role in building 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Wascana. 
 

International Model United Nations Conference 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A group of 
University of Regina students, along with political science 
professor Dr. Shreesh Juyal, recently travelled to New York city 
to take part in the International Model UN [United Nations] 
Conference at the UN General Assembly hall. Some of those 
students have met with our Minister of Finance, and I journeyed 
part of the way with some of the group too. 
 
Mr. Speaker, since Dr. Juyal started the Model UN Club at the 
U of R in 1979, 17 of his students have had the distinction of 
becoming Canadian diplomats for various countries. 
 
This year’s delegation was made up of 14 students from a 
variety of academic backgrounds. They joined 3,300 other 
students, professors, and diplomats from 27 countries, and 
participated on a variety of challenging committees, including 
UNESCO [United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization] and the Commission on Human Rights. This year 
for the first time, the U or R students were selected to represent 
a major world power; in this case, the country of India. They 
demonstrated their capability in the art of international 
negotiations, caucusing, resolution sponsorship, and diplomatic 
skills. 
 
I ask all my colleagues to join me in acknowledging this year’s 
delegation. Their participation at the International Model UN 
Conference has provided them with invaluable insight and 
experience, and I’m urging some of them to consider a seat in 
the Assembly in the future, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I want to congratulate Dr. Shreesh Juyal for his commitment to 
the program. And I’d particularly like to acknowledge Nathan 
Van Beseleare, a student who lives in my constituency of 
Regina Wascana Plains, and Kashif Ahmed, a long-time friend. 
Congratulations to all; a job well done. Thank you very much 
for being our model UN participants. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 

Foam Lake Athletes Give Top Performances 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, Lou Holtz, Notre Dame coach, 
football said: 
 

Ability is what you’re capable of doing. Motivation 
determines what you do. Attitude determines how well 
you do it. 

 
Mr. Speaker, the Foam Lake Lady Panthers basketball team and 

several members of the Rose Valley Karate Club may not have 
heard this quote, but regardless, they have learned that ability, 
motivation, hard work, and attitude can and does produce 
winners. 
 
The Foam Lake Lady Panthers basketball team capped a 30 
win, 3 loss season with their very first provincial 2A basketball 
championship at Hoopla. At the beginning of this year, this 
team set the goal to win gold and they succeeded. The road to 
their championship began with an east-central district 2A girls 
championship followed by a regional competition which earned 
them a seat at Hoopla. 
 
And Mr. Speaker, I’d like to congratulate the Foam Lake Lady 
Panthers consisting of coach Garth Anderson, team members 
Victoria Kolybaba, Celise Kowalchuk, Gillian Halyk, Brittany 
Faye, Katy McMann, Kiera Kerluke, Ann Nahrstedt, Ashlyn 
George, Therese Borger, Carlli Anderson, Jade Pickering, and 
Kristen Bulych. 
 
Another group of individuals who have worked hard are the 
members of the Rose Valley Karate Club. At a recent provincial 
competition in Rosetown, Carrie Balaski won a gold medal, 
while Tanice Balaski, Kristoffer Berg, Kristen Fitch, and Ona 
Murias won silver medals. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask members to congratulate the winners of the 
Foam Lake ladies basketball team and the members of the Rose 
Valley Karate Club on their top performances. Best of luck to 
all of them in the future. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Fairview. 
 

Saskatoon Hosts Anne Frank Exhibit 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: —   Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, next month a partnership between the city of 
Saskatoon and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission, 
Saskatoon, will bring an exhibit called Anne Frank in the World 
to Saskatoon. 
 
Mr. Speaker, through her diary Anne Frank has inspired the 
world, becoming a symbol of millions who died in the death 
camps during the Second World War and of the strength, grace 
and capacity for hope of the human spirit, even in the face of a 
regime as abhorrent and as oppressive as that of the Nazis. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Saskatoon Anne Frank committee has been 
instrumental in bringing this display to the city. It is intended to 
educate our young people, build bridges of understanding, and 
encourage relating with one another in a dignified and 
respectful manner. 
 
I want to congratulate the Saskatoon Anne Frank committee for 
bringing this exhibit and its message of tolerance to the city. As 
the committee notes, its hope is that the Anne Frank exhibit will 
be a catalyst for addressing and healing the racism and other 
forms of discrimination in our community, making our province 
a community where different cultures feel welcome and 
respected. 



April 14, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2519 

Mr. Speaker, the exhibit will be at the Diefenbaker Canada 
Centre from May 16 to June 30, and I invite everyone who has 
the opportunity to attend. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 

Centenarian Recognized 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to talk 
today about our centenarians. It’s amazing how many 
centenarians there are in each of our constituencies and how 
many there are across the province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, today I’d like to talk about Agnes Steeves. 
Agnes was born on July 30, 1905, in North Dakota. She 
graduated from Kenmare in 1923 and went to Minot State 
college. She then married Currie Steeves from the Carievale 
area, the very south end of my constituency, Mr. Speaker. 
 
But Agnes had a teaching job across in North Dakota already. 
And for that school year, she travelled back and forth every day, 
every school day, across the border to continue teaching in 
North Dakota and didn’t once, Mr. Speaker, go through a 
customs port. It was simply back and forth because there were 
no problems, and there was no BSE [bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy] at that time, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Agnes became a full-fledged Canadian housewife in 1928 and 
had four children. She continues to live in the Sunset Haven in 
Carnduff, and knows and recognizes many of her friends. 
 
My first meeting with Agnes, Mr. Speaker, was in the 1991 
election. When I knocked on her door, she said, I know who 
you are. Slammed the door in my face. 1995, Mr. Speaker, I 
knocked on her door again, and she invited me in for cake and 
cookies. I’d like to congratulate Agnes Steeves on 100 years. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Nursing Shortage 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s a 
known fact that health regions have been managing the nurse 
shortage by using extra nurses for overtime, and overtime is 
expensive. Not only in the dollar value does it cost more to the 
health districts, but there’s higher burnout. There is poor 
working conditions, lower morale, more compensation claims, 
and more sick time. Not to mention the fact that there’s a safety 
issue as well. 
 
Why does the NDP [New Democratic Party] refuse to hire more 
permanent full-time nurses to deal with the nursing shortage 
instead of working nurses like dogs and using overtime to make 
up that shortage? 
 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the regional health 
authorities are looking to hire nurses across the province, and 
that information is available for anybody who wishes to look 
for it on the Sask Health website and the links to each of the 
regional health authorities. 
 
They are continuing to require more nurses in most parts of the 
province. I think practically, there are fewer nursing positions 
open in Regina and Saskatoon, but those nurses are being hired 
across the province. Mr. Speaker, the goal is to have the 
workplace organized in a way that will allow for some of those 
nurses to choose to work part-time jobs, but also the goal is to 
have full-time work for all of our new graduates. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, we know that the health 
districts are hiring nurses on casual positions, through casual 
positions and then relying on overtime to fill up the gap, Mr. 
Speaker. And that’s why SUN [Saskatchewan Union of 
Nurses], in past contracts, have negotiated deterrents, deterrents 
for health districts to use overtime to fill in this gap. They use 
deterrents by increasing the cost, wages of nurses working 
overtime and so that health districts would not rely on this. 
 
But the NDP now, in their negotiations, are looking at rolling 
back those deterrents. Rolling back the extra costs that it would 
cost health districts. Mr. Speaker, overtime leads to burnout in 
nurses, leads to early retirement. And now, this NDP 
government is rolling back the deterrent for health districts to 
do that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, how will this lead to retaining and recruiting 
nurses when you work the . . . when you rely on overtime so 
much to keep our health care system working? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, contrary to what the member 
says opposite, the regional health authorities, working with the 
nursing managers and others, have been examining the overtime 
issue. And we’ve actually brought down the percentage of 
overtime that is being paid for nursing staff. And, Mr. Speaker, 
we’re continuing to work on that. This is monitored on a very 
regular basis to see what the performance is across the province. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that involves many different 
factors. It involves the numbers of nurses available. It involves 
how the contracts work for nursing, and then how everything is 
managed. Mr. Speaker, this is something that cannot be solved 
with a simple policy thing, but it is something we’re working on 
very, very diligently.

Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, it’s interesting because the 
minister then is admitting that we are relying far too much on 
overtime in our health care, for our health nurses, with our 
nurses. But by rolling back that deterrent is only going to allow 
health districts to rely more on overtime, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the NDP first of all had said that for nurses, the 
contract was going to be 0, 1, and 1. I think nurses now are 
saying that wouldn’t be bad, after listening to the first round of 
negotiations where they’re rolling a number of the benefits and 
issues back, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have the dubious distinction in this province of 
having the worst nurse retention record across the nation. How 
will rolling back some of the things that the nurses have 
negotiated in past help retain nurses in this province? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I think the member’s asking 
some very specific questions about the bargaining table. And as 
he knows and the public knows, we won’t go and talk about 
that. 
 
But talking generally around what our goal is for the health care 
system — and this is true not just in health care, in fact — but 
we have many employees who have long experience, good solid 
experience that they want to pass on to a new generation of 
younger workers. And we’re trying to sort out how we provide 
those full-time jobs for the new graduates, and at the same time 
acknowledge and recognize the very good work and the positive 
things that have been done by our senior staff. And some of 
those things are a challenge to do within the whole structure 
that we have now. When that becomes a problem, then at the 
bargaining table they talk about it, in the management places 
they talk about it. And we’re continuing to work on these 
particular challenges. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, we all know that there is a 
nursing shortage in this province. And to correct that we need 
more full-time permanent nursing positions in this province, not 
address it with overtime — full-time permanent positions. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Helen Head, a graduate of nursing a few years 
ago, wrote to the Leader-Post a couple of months ago and 
talked about her situation. And here’s what she had to say: 
 

I was hired as a temporary full-time employee for 120 
days (there is nothing permanent) . . . 

 
And she was hired to the general surgery at the Pasqua 
Hospital. 
 

This temporary position lasted for 2 years. [Now] I am . . . 
a casual employee . . . 
 

She’s looking for full-time work in surgery in this province and 
can’t find it, Mr. Speaker. That’s unacceptable when we rely on 
overtime to fill up the gap, Mr. Speaker. When will he look at 
increasing the full-time permanent jobs in this province to deal 
with the nursing shortage? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the member of the 
Conservative opposition asked a similar question of me during 
estimates the other day. And the answer was that the percentage 
of full-time jobs in Saskatchewan for nursing, the nursing 
profession, is above the national average. 
 
But our goal is to continue to provide as many full-time jobs as 
we can for our new graduates while respecting the senior staff 
who wish to work on some other schedule that isn’t full time. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a challenge. It is something that involves 
the contract. It involves how we manage what we’re doing in 
the whole situation, and it involves quality workplaces. All of 
these are initiatives that are part of what we’re working at right 
now.

Health Card for New Immigrant 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
Janie Marie Edwards-Dixon lives on a ranch south of Val 
Marie. She was married to a Canadian citizen in January 2004. 
She applied for permanent residency on November 5, 2004. 
 
When she applied for a health card, Mrs. Edwards-Dixon was 
told no card could be issued until Immigration Canada started 
its review of the application for permanent residency. Mr. 
Speaker, Immigration Canada is doing its job. The application 
is now under review. All the conditions have been met but still 
no health card. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of Health, why doesn’t Mrs. 
Edwards-Dixon have a health card? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, this is a particular challenge 
that we’ve had around the immigration process of the federal 
government. And, Mr. Speaker, it used to be that we would 
require that they would have permanent status in Canada. We 
then changed the policy to having information that it was being 
reviewed, and practically I think we’ve recently changed our 
regulations to deal with exactly this case. 
 
I would ask the member to make sure that that kind of 
information is provided to my office, and we will look to have 
this one dealt with. But previously there were problems, and we 
identified that, and we’ve fixed it. 



April 14, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2521 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Wood 
River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, the information has been provided to the minister’s 
office. Mrs. Edwards-Dixon was told she could not have a 
health card until the Immigration Canada started reviewing the 
application. Now she’s told by Sask Health there’s been a 
change in the policy. No card will be issued until the 
application is approved. 
 
Mrs. Edwards-Dixon says that it seems every time she meets 
the standard, the standard changes. She calls it unfair. Mr. 
Speaker, can the minister explain why the rules have been 
changed, if they’ve been changed, and why? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, we’ve had a number of 
challenges with the opposition Conservative party’s research. I 
would ask that member to provide me with that information, 
and we will look at that. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Wood 
River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well I’ve 
already explained. I have provided the information to the 
minister in form of a letter from myself directly to him. 
 
This adds to the issue also, Mr. Speaker. Mrs. Edwards-Dixon 
is a nurse. She’s an RN [registered nurse]. She’s ready to work, 
but she can’t afford to pay for the accreditation because as 
things are ongoing now, she has to pay her medical costs 
because she doesn’t have a health card. She’s applied for 
Canadian citizenship. She’s married to a Canadian. Her 
daughter is attending school in Saskatchewan. Her vehicle has 
Saskatchewan plates. She’s about to give birth to a 
Saskatchewan citizen. She wants to work but she can’t afford to 
because she’s paying the health costs and can’t afford the 
accreditation. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is another example of the NDP creating 
barriers to attract qualified professionals such as Mrs. 
Edwards-Dixon — barriers that try and attract people to this 
province. Mr. Speaker, when can the minister tell us that she 
will have a health card and when will he get his house in order? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, as I’ve said before I have a 
great deal of difficulty relying on the research capacity across 
the way but I will look at that particular case and make sure that 
there’s an appropriate response. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we work very carefully to make sure that our rules 
are available to include people. If there are some problems then 
we fix those rules. But, Mr. Speaker, this is a very specific case 
and we need to have a better look at it.

Tax Relief for New Businesses 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Entrepreneurs 
and academics in Saskatchewan are telling this government it’s 
missing another opportunity to spur on economic development. 
Right now an investment tax credit is available to small 
businesses to offset the cost of the 7 per cent provincial sales 
tax. However start-up businesses usually don’t get a chance to 
use this tax credit and the provincial sales tax is a barrier to 
growth. 
 
Jason Skotheim from Horizon Manufacturing has written to the 
Premier saying, and I quote, “Saskatchewan is the most punitive 
jurisdiction in North America” as it pertains to start-up 
business. 
 
Mr. Speaker, will this government consider an exemption from 
the PST [provincial sales tax] on manufacturing and 
processing? Will this government give tax relief some 
immediate value to businesses just starting up? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, we announced on 
budget day that there will be a review of business taxes in 
Saskatchewan to see how we can improve business taxes to 
encourage job creation and economic development in 
Saskatchewan. The investment tax credit that the member 
speaks about will certainly form part of that review. We look 
forward to the deliberations of the business tax review 
committee and their report this fall with a view to incorporating 
their recommendations into next year’s budget and future 
budgets, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I remind the 
minister that people like Mr. Skotheim are looking for action 
and leadership from this government now. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this week we saw this NDP government embrace 
the opposition’s idea of new growth tax incentives. And that’s a 
positive sign, Mr. Speaker. That’s a positive sign — number 21 
in our list of 100. They’re learning, slowly. But why stop there? 
If it works for the potash sector, why not help small 
manufacturing businesses? Why not provide a PST exemption 
on the purchase of manufacturing and processing equipment? 
Why not give a boost to rural economies, the value-added 
processing industry, and create some jobs now? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, the Saskatchewan 
government in 1995, the NDP government of the day, changed 
the way in which we treated manufacturing and processing. At 
that time there were major changes made, not only to provide 
for an investment tax credit, but also to reduce the corporate 



2522 Saskatchewan Hansard April 14, 2005 

income tax rate for manufacturing and processing businesses. 
 
Since that time, we’ve seen the increase in value of 
manufacturing shipments since that time outstrip the rest of 
Canada. We look forward to continuing to make progress in this 
matter, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind that 
minister that he is part of a government that presides over the 
worst job creation record in the country over the last five years, 
less than half of one per cent per year growth. Shameful. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this government is good at breaking its promises 
and raising taxes when times are bad. But when the situation 
improves, the taxes stay like some kind of bad hangover. Mr. 
Speaker, this is an easy way to create some growth. There is an 
easy way to create some jobs. If the minister won’t roll back the 
PST and give ordinary people some tax relief, will he at least 
give sales tax exemptions on manufacturing and processing 
equipment? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the member 
speaks of an easy way. And I think the easy way he 
demonstrated the other day when he said, you know, you should 
just take $55 a barrel as oil and put that into your budget 
because then you’d have an extra $400 million to spend, 
perhaps on matters such as this, Mr. Speaker. Well today, Mr. 
Speaker, oil is around $50 a barrel. So since that call by the 
opposition to book a certain level, we’ve seen a drastic drop. 
 
This is so typical of the Conservatives in Saskatchewan, Mr. 
Speaker, always spend more than you have. Always spend more 
than you have. Promise the people the sun, the moon, the stars; 
anything, everything, to curry favour, Mr. Speaker. But never, 
never be responsible. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — . . . to remind the Finance Minister, that 
$51 a barrel US [United States] is $10 more than $41 a barrel 
US. Well, Mr. Speaker, I read this morning that the minister of 
industry . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please, members. Order. Order. The 
floor’s with the member for Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I read this 
morning, Mr. Speaker, that the Minister of Industry and 
Resources is this NDP’s government last link to business. I read 
in The StarPhoenix that this minister is the last person over 
there that can keep in check an NDP government that is, and get 
this, Mr. Speaker, I quote: 
 

 . . . [an] evil twin [that] is . . . [ideologically and] 
disorganized, with a tendency to lurch from one crisis to 
the next with no clear idea of its destination or how to get 
there. 

 
End quote, Mr. Speaker. Truer words have never been written. 
Will this minister use the last remaining shreds of influence to 
keep that evil, ideological NDP twin in check? Will he push 
through a proposal on PST exemptions for new business 
equipment? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, the Conservative 
opposition Finance critic who apprenticed under the Devine 
regime in the 1980s, I can tell you it’s not the last link to that 
regime. There are other members of that side who also have 
either served in that administration or have links. Also the 
Leader of the Opposition had links to that regime. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to today to welcome, to welcome the 
Conservative Finance critic to the billion dollar club in 
Saskatchewan. Mr. Speaker, we have one member from the 
Devine administration — the Finance minister in 1986-87 — 
who ballooned their deficit by $1 billion. This member should 
also be made a member of that club for having the fastest 
increase in billion dollar spending in Saskatchewan history, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 

Quota for Egg Producers 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, another broken promise. For years unregistered egg 
producers have been on a waiting list trying to get quota. In 
January 2003 the then Minister for Agriculture, the member for 
Yorkton, promised an unregulated egg producer that, and I 
quote: 
 

. . . existing individuals on these [waiting] lists will be 
solely eligible for a first auction of new quota . . . 

 
Imagine the surprise, Mr. Speaker, when these unregistered egg 
producers found a recent newspaper ad for a public auction for 
egg quota. Mr. Speaker, to the Deputy Premier, why did the 
new Minister of Rural Development break his word once again? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Mr. Speaker, to the member opposite, I 
want to say that the Minister of Agriculture has been working 
very closely with the Saskatchewan egg producers in the 
province, Mr. Speaker. He’s worked very closely with them to 
establish the new quotas. 
 
We have a new process, Mr. Speaker, today in terms of how we 
handle the quotas as the right to the feather industry and the egg 



April 14, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2523 

industry. And I say to the member opposite that he should 
review those carefully because the producers in Saskatchewan 
today, both in the egg production and the feather production, 
support the kinds of direction of which the government is 
proceeding with on the quota system, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Well, Mr. Speaker, in that letter to Terry 
Motz, the Deputy Premier made a commitment. And I’ll repeat 
that commitment. 
 

. . . quota waiting lists will be phased out but existing 
individuals on these lists will be solely eligible for first 
auction of new quota . . . 
 

Not happening, Mr. Speaker. 
 
That was a commitment made by the Deputy Premier and 
another broken promise by the NDP government. Mr. Speaker, 
Terry Motz is an unregistered egg producer from Glidden. He 
wants quota. In March of last year he was told the quota 
allocation policies were under review. And now he sees in the 
newspaper the quotas will be auctioned off tomorrow. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this government made a promise to this producer. 
What happened to that promise? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, when we 
established the new quota system in Saskatchewan, the 
commitment to egg producers in the province and those who are 
involved in the feather industry were that we were moving to a 
new system. For those people who are unregistered as Mr. Motz 
was, we advised Mr. Motz that there would be in fact a new 
system and that we would examine that process and ensure that 
those people who do not have quota, Mr. Speaker, would have 
an opportunity to participate in fact in the new structure. 
 
And I say, Mr. Speaker, today to the member opposite that 
when he raises the issue about broken promises in 
Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker, I say to the member opposite in 
Agriculture, you are one of the key players . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Order, please. Order, please. 
Order, please. I’ll just ask the Deputy Premier to direct all of his 
remarks to the Chair. The floor belongs to the Deputy Premier. 
 
[10:45] 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Mr. Speaker, that member from Saltcoats 
Melville, Mr. Speaker, is one of the players who said in this 
House, Mr. Speaker, that he didn’t support the changes to the 
agricultural programs . . . or supported the changes to the 
agricultural program in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And then when we got to Ottawa, Mr. Speaker, he’s the guy 

who then says, when we return, we don’t support the 
Saskatchewan egg producers. We don’t support the 
Saskatchewan farmers. We don’t support Saskatchewan policy, 
Mr. Speaker. He’s the guy who’s in there changing the policy, 
Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The member for Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, I believe we’ve hit a nerve over there especially with 
the Deputy Premier. Now he’s getting up and telling that 
producer, he will have an opportunity to bid. That’s not what he 
told the producer in January of 2003. And I quote again, he 
says: 
 

. . . existing individuals on . . . [the] lists will be solely 
eligible for . . . [the] first auction of new quota . . . 
 

Here we go. It’s in the paper. He’s not solely eligible for the 
first quota, everybody is eligible. Will that minister and that 
government ever make a commitment — stand behind that 
commitment — so that producers in the province can believe 
something that they are promised by the NDP? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Mr. Speaker, the producers of 
Saskatchewan just need to check the record of this 
administration, Mr. Speaker. They just need to check the record 
of this administration and they will see, Mr. Speaker, that the 
record of this administration, Mr. Speaker, brought additional 
money to farmers under the new transportation program — 
$300 million more, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when you take a look at the commitment that this 
government has made on the CAIS program, on supporting the 
AIDA [agricultural income disaster assistance] program, Mr. 
Speaker, and ensuring that we fund the crop insurance program 
to full extent, Mr. Speaker, our commitments, not only have 
met our obligations but they’ve exceeded them. 
 
On every occasion, Mr. Speaker, that we’ve had in this House 
where we debate agricultural policy, there is only one inhibitor, 
Mr. Speaker, in terms of agriculture policy in Saskatchewan and 
it’s the Conservative party from across the way, Mr. Speaker. 
Because it’s they, Mr. Speaker, who in fact stand in the way of 
restructuring of Saskatchewan agricultural policy. And on every 
occasion, Mr. Speaker, it is that Conservative party that gets in 
the way of constructive agriculture policy in the province, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!
