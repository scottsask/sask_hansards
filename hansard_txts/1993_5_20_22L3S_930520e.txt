 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 1871 

 May 20, 1993 

 

EVENING SITTING 

 

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 

 

General Revenue Fund 

Public Service Commission 

Vote 33 

Item 2 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Minister, I 

told you this afternoon that I would get those Taylor names for 

you, which I have them for the record now.  In fact I have 

several names that I picked up a couple more through the 

evening that had the same type of firings. 

 

And it was Katherine Taylor. She worked for Sask Housing, 

and she was a daughter of Graham Taylor.  She was fired at 

Christmas time on '91, and she had such a crude firing that at 

the Christmas party they didn't even give her a Christmas 

present.  I mean it was just an unreal firing and I'd like you to 

just check into that, Mr. Minister.  This is not the people . . . the 

people that I deal with here, it's not their type of doing . . . way 

of doing things. 

 

And the daughter-in-law's name was Carla.  When she was 

hired by government at the Liquor Board, it was Carla 

Lozinski, and she was hired at the Liquor Board and she was 

fired about the same time, a day or two into the new year.  And 

at the time she was fired she would be Carla Taylor.  She was 

hired, Mr. Minister, in government and then she couldn't help 

it, she was . . . fall in love with a Taylor and then this 

government come along and then whoof, they're gone.  So it 

was pretty . . . pretty serious stuff for these young people. 

 

And then the other one is just a young man. It was Tim 

Chatterson, and he worked for Property Management, and he 

was just up and gone.  And the other one was quite a sad one, a 

nephew by marriage to Mr. Taylor, and his name is Willard 

Thomson.  And he was fired.  He was just a janitor at the 

museum.  And he was a native boy.  And too close related to 

Mr. Taylor and gone. 

 

I'd like you to look into this kind of stuff, Mr. Minister, because 

it's just come to my attention the last . . . didn't have a chance to 

ask before and it wasn't the kind of things to ask in question 

period.  And I know that you will look into these things, and 

also of that Kevin Williams I gave you this afternoon. 

 

One must question, Mr. Minister . . . Somebody's kind of 

snickering about no Christmas presents over there.  I don't 

know who it is, Mr. Chairman, but it's not very becoming of 

anyone when we're talking about young people being fired.  

And I think that it can be corrected because these things are not 

right.  But it's not right for a member to laugh about it. 

 

I question, Mr. Minister, yourself when you always said there'd 

be no political patronage and this government will stand on that 

and there hasn't been. 

 This is your quote from some time ago, maybe a year ago now.  

But I want to question you on Zach Douglas who was hired in 

the Economic Development department and climbed in a very 

short time to become the vice-president of SEDCO 

(Saskatchewan Economic Development Corporation).  Would 

he be involved with the PSC (Public Service Commission)? 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Douglas in none of his jobs has 

passed through the Public Service Commission process.  

They've been Crown corporation or jobs at which the 

corporation is not . . . or the commission has not been involved. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  I have another 

one and I don't know where he came from, so that's why I'll 

have to ask the question.  You'll have to inform me whether he 

came from a Crown or department.  Mr. Ian Laidlaw -- I hope 

I'm pronouncing that right -- was let go from a government 

department.  Do you know if that was a department or a 

Crown? 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- I think this is the Mr. Laidlaw that has 

been raised during question period once or twice.  Again, this 

individual has never passed through the Public Service 

Commission process.  I believe that he was employed, if I 

remember the line of questioning, with SPMC (Saskatchewan 

Property Management Corporation) and was . . . That's a 

Crown corporation, as you know.  And wherever it is that he's 

working now, it is not part of the public service proper, so that 

he's never passed through the Public Service Commission 

process. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, that's fine.  My information 

was just the department, and I didn't know whether it was a 

Crown corporation.  I have several like that, and I'll just leave 

those to the appropriate ministers in their Crowns.  That's all 

the questioning I had left, Mr. Minister. 

 

Item 2 agreed to. 

 

Items 3 to 5 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Vote 33 agreed to. 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the 

members of the Assembly I'd like to thank my officials for 

coming this afternoon and again this evening to assist the 

committee in its work. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Minister, I 

also would like to thank the officials, and we've had an hour 

and a half roughly, Mr. Minister, where we've got along very 

well.  And we hope that all the questions that I've asked that 

you'll be supplying. I'm quite sure we'll get them in due course.  

And we just hope that you and I can get along as good this next 

hour or two on the next . . . on SPMC.  I'm not quite, 

sometimes quite as good a humour in the evening but we'll see 

what we can do.  And I again want to thank your officials and 

thank you, Mr. Chairman. 



1872 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

General Revenue Fund 

Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation 

Vote 53 

 

The Chair: -- I would ask the minister responsible for the 

Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation to introduce 

the officials who have joined us here tonight. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Thank you very much, Mr. 

Chairman.  I would like to introduce, to my left, Brian 

Woodcock, the president of the corporation, and to his left, Al 

Moffat.  Al Moffat is the vice-president of commercial 

services.  Immediately behind me is Rob Isbister, the director 

of financial planning and reporting, and to his left is John Law, 

senior vice-president of finance and accommodation. 

 

Item 1 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. 

Minister.  I too would like to welcome your staff here this 

evening and we'll move on with some questioning. 

 

Mr. Minister, I would like to start out . . . Firstly, when I 

finished off with the last minister on PSC, I was thinking that 

he was the minister coming on.  I knew better, but I sent him 

off with too nice a departing.  I'll have to be a little different 

with you now that he's got away.  But I'll be very kind.  I'll be 

as kind as I can, Mr. Minister, as long as you answer the 

questions. 

 

I'd like to start out by asking a few questions about your 

ministerial staff -- provide the names, job descriptions, 

qualifications, and salaries of your staff. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I think 

to expedite the process here I would just maybe send over a list 

of my ministerial staff.  On it is their position, their salaries, 

and what their duties are with respect to the operation of my 

office. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Chairman, I don't know. Were you not 

asked to provide this ahead of time like different . . . like the 

other departments, information like this?  Were you not asked 

for information prior? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, I was advised by my 

officials that we were asked for a list of information.  That was 

not among the list of things, but I do have that list of the 

questions that were asked of us beforehand, and I can send that 

across to the member. 

 

The Chair: -- Order, order.  Order. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- I had completed my answer, Mr. 

Chairman.  I just would want to indicate to the member if he'd 

like I can pass across a copy of the list of the answers to the 

questions that were provided to us beforehand, if he would like. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Yes, I'd appreciate that and seeing that 

this wasn't asked, it should have been for the job descriptions 

and qualification, salaries of your staff.  Maybe you could read 

that into the record, seeing that wasn't asked for so we will 

know what the salaries are and the names of your staff.  Would 

you please read that page into the record. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, I can, Mr. Chairman.  The 

chief of staff is Andrew Thomson at a salary of $50,652.  His 

duties are management and policy, House business, cabinet, 

caucus, and constituency liaison.  The second ministerial 

assistant is Sean Caragata at a salary of $41,448.  His 

responsibilities are the Liquor Board, the Liquor Licensing 

Commission, and Gaming.  The third ministerial assistant is 

Tricia Harding at a salary of $34,716.  Her responsibilities are 

directly with SPMC, Saskatchewan Forest Products.  My 

secretarial staff is Sandra McLean at $38,556.  And do you 

want the job description on her as well . . . (inaudible 

interjection) . . . She is secretary, cabinet and caucus 

documents, her areas of responsibility.  Cindy Wolk at 

$33,420; she is the first assistant secretary.  She deals with 

department referrals, incoming correspondence.  And the last 

secretarial staff is Michelle Kobayashi at 25,692.  She is the 

second assistant secretary.  She deals with outgoing 

correspondence, files, and supplies. 

 

(1915) 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  Did you inherit 

any staff from the previous minister when you became minister 

in this last year? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Not ministerial staff.  The 

ministerial staff in my office was all new when I was sworn 

into cabinet. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- So when you became minister, this group of 

six was all new employees to your office.  Did any of them 

transfer from another minister's office or were they all 

brand-new moving in? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- I can say that Mr. Thomson was 

originally, I think upon his employment with the Government 

of Saskatchewan, working for the government caucus.  He was 

for a period of time working in Executive Council.  He was 

then hired in the former minister of Finance's office and from 

the former minister of Finance's office he moved to my office 

as the second ministerial assistant and was later promoted to 

chief of staff. 

 

Sean Caragata was hired from a position with a law firm in 

Ontario; Tricia Harding came from the University of 

Saskatchewan, I'm not sure what her previous employment 

was.  I can't recall right now but we can find that for you.  

Sandra McLean worked in the civil service, I believe with the 

Fire Commission.  Cindy Wolk, I'm just . . . It slips my mind 

where Ms. Wolk came from but I can find that for you.  It was 

within the civil service, as was Michelle Kobayashi. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- That's fine, you don't have to give me that 

other name.  It's not important . . . or the other, where she came 

from. 

 

Mr. Minister, are all your staff working in Regina? 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1873 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Do you have any other political staff located 

in Saskatoon or elsewhere in the province, political staff? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- No. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, we know that all the members 

of your staff are being paid from SPMC.  I understand that, 

that's what you said tonight.  Even though they have nothing to 

do with SPMC, they're paid from there.  How are they all . . . 

How is your staff . . . what staff would look after SPMC duties 

or whatever?  Like, they wouldn't all be working for SPMC.  

Would you break that down for me, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well first of all let me say to the 

member that they are . . . as the lead agency in my portfolio, 

Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation is 

responsible for the ministerial budget, for my office budget. 

 

Within the framework of that budget, these employees are 

hired.  They deal with budgetary issues, as you will know, 

having formerly been in cabinet; they deal with policy issues; 

and they deal with liaison with people throughout the province 

in terms of concerns that they have with government direction, 

government policy; and they feed that input to my office and 

through my office to the government department. 

 

I would want to say that I am very pleased with the kind of 

attention that my staff deliver to the people of Saskatchewan.  I 

think that they have been . . . for a group of young people, have 

done an exemplary job and I'm very proud of the work that they 

do. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, what other staff members do 

you have doing other duties?  Like, you have other duties of 

government.  Which ones does other duties and which ones are 

directly, nothing else but SPMC?  That's what I more or less 

want. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well as I've indicated and read into 

the record, Mr. Minister, Mr. Caragata deals with the Liquor 

Board and Liquor Licensing Commission, Gaming; Tricia 

Harding has dealt with Saskatchewan Property Management 

Corporation and Sask Forest Products which are other parts of 

my portfolio; my chief of staff, Andrew Thomson, deals with 

management and policy, House business, cabinet, caucus, and 

constituency liaison. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Well, Mr. Minister, you're saying they're all 

involved with SPMC, but still the paper you sent over to me 

here and what you read into the record, I only see one name, 

and that's Tricia Harding is SPMC.  They all seem to have 

other duties.  So looks to me like you've got at least five of 

your staff are paid by SPMC, but they don't work for SPMC.  It 

just doesn't come clear with what you're saying, Mr. Minister. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well I think perhaps what I should 

do is clarify for the member from Arm River 

because I'm not sure if he's familiar with the report of the 

Provincial Auditor.  It may be that he hasn't read the 

appropriate parts as it deals with the hiring of ministerial 

assistants and how they are paid. 

 

So let me just quote from chapter 6. 

 

Appropriate departments, agencies, and Crown 

corporations which are legally permitted and which appear 

before the Committee of Finance should provide all 

furnitures, support services, ministerial assistants and any 

other goods or services required for the operation of 

Ministers' offices. 

 

As a former member of the Executive Council and one who 

was involved in the structuring of the Property Management 

Corporation, I'm sure you're well aware that the Property 

Management Corporation reports to the Committee of Finance, 

and it appears before the Committee of Finance and as such is 

an appropriate vehicle to hire and to fund the ministerial office.  

And that's what it does. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Chairman, Mr. Minister, now this seems 

to be just a Property Management office as far as I can see, an 

SPMC office completely.  Where does your salary come from 

then?  Do they pay it too?  Where's your salary come from? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well as you will know, my salary as 

an MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) is paid in the 

same fashion that yours is, through the Legislative Assembly 

Office. 

 

And my ministerial salary is paid by the Saskatchewan 

Property Management Corporation.  That's where the 

ministerial budget is as you will, I would have assumed, have 

been aware how these things function.  The ministerial 

assistants are all part and parcel of my budget and as such are 

funded from Property Management Corporation which, as I 

indicated, is an appropriate vehicle as the auditor has indicated 

in the auditor's report. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Minister, I 

understand the way it should be because I was in Executive 

Council and of course I understand the way it was run when we 

were there, but with you people you never know.  It didn't have 

to be run that way.  And I'm not saying that with you, Mr. 

Minister, because I don't know yet until we do a little more line 

of questioning here. 

 

Mr. Minister, I got a commitment from the minister this 

afternoon that when we're talking about PSC that there was 

none of the ministers' offices were being paid in this manner, 

that they were all being paid by OCs (order in council) in 

Executive Council.  So is your staff an OC being paid by 

Management Corporation or what are they?  I mean, are they 

seconded or are they hired by OC and paid by Executive 

Council? 

 

The Chair: -- Order.  Order. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, in answer to 



1874 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

the member's question, they are all under individual contracts 

to the Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Minister, that puts 

us in some situation here because I got the wrong information 

from the Minister of Justice and the minister responsible for the 

Public Service Commission this afternoon, because he said 

absolutely that there wasn't one minister's office, that all the 

staff was hired by order in council and paid by the Executive 

Council. 

 

Now we move into your department and it's the first 

department that I've had a chance to question since he left, and 

I need him back here . . . get him straightened out . . . or 

straighten out this situation.  How come that we'd have the 

Minister of Justice, the high profile cabinet minister and I 

questioned him and questioned him on this, because we already 

knew from articles in papers that your staff was paid by SPMC.  

And now you say that they're on contract from SPMC.  Now 

let's get this real, real straight. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, in answer to 

the member's question, I guess I can . . . I wasn't here, I'm 

sorry, for the Public Service Commission estimates, and I guess 

we can review in Hansard what may have happened this 

afternoon. 

 

I can only say that my former portfolios, my ministerial staff 

were paid in . . . before the reorganization of the departments, 

the ministerial staff were paid by the line departments that I 

was responsible for.  There were some that were designated to 

Rural Development and some were designated to Natural 

Resources and that is how I understand the funding share works 

with respect to those.  I can only say to you that the individual 

contracts that my staff have with the Property Management 

Corporation are appropriate.  They correspond to the concerns 

of the Provincial Auditor, and I would want to say that we have 

been very careful in terms of making public the salaries of 

ministerial staff because we think the people of the province 

have a right to know. 

 

We have not attempted, as the former administration did, to 

hide ministerial staff in Crown corporations, and I can suggest 

to you that the staff that I have hired are all . . . It's all been 

publicly documented.  Their salaries are publicly documented.  

We have put them before the people because that's the type of 

government that we want to run.  And I want to say as well that 

in compliance with the concerns of the auditor, we have done 

just that. 

 

I would like to say as well, the cost of my staff is considerably 

down from what members of the former government were 

paying their staff, number one; and number two, that the 

numbers are down.  I have six staff in my office.  Under the 

former administration, I understand that there were eight 

ministerial assistants paid for through either the line 

departments or the agencies that these ministers represented. 

 

We have as well standardized the wage scales for 

these ministerial assistants.  We have three levels depending on 

their role and depending on the job that they're asked to 

perform.  My chief of staff, as I've indicated to you, is clearly 

paid more than the second in command who is paid more than 

the third in command.  We have set up these rate structures 

because we feel that this is the fairest way, and we wanted to 

have uniform salaries across this portion of government.  And 

we have attempted to do that, and I think we've achieved what 

we set out to accomplish. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, I'm not caring whether you 

have your staff paid out of whatever department. This doesn't 

make any difference.  It's all . . . it's all funding.  But what 

bothers me -- and I know that this is the fact here, but I took the 

minister's word this afternoon and we can't go back into his 

estimates -- but I took his word and I just took it for granted 

that this here article in the paper, that this staff is all . . . your 

staff is all paid under SPMC because he clearly said there 

wasn't any.  So I took him at his word. 

 

(1930) 

 

So anyway he must have made a mistake and . . . but I don't 

understand why when you have your staff paid out of SPMC 

that your government is suing a Judy Bellay, an innocent 

woman because she was paid from a Crown corporation.  What 

difference did it make?  You're being paid from a Crown 

corporation, your staff, and you think it's all right.  And is it . . . 

did it make a difference whether somebody didn't put it in the 

paper that Judy was being paid from a Crown corporation?  

Can you explain that, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well, in answer to the member's 

question, let me say this: that the staff who were paid as 

ministerial assistants to work in the minister's office actually 

work in the minister's office and perform duties out of the 

minister's office, for the minister and for the people of 

Saskatchewan. 

 

I would say that that was not necessarily the finding of the 

Provincial Auditor when he sent down the special auditor's 

report.  And I think the member's well aware of that.  But I 

don't want to get into politics here.  What I want to do is be 

open and explain, very concisely, how my staff are paid, the 

amounts that they are paid, and I don't want to rehash the 1980s 

and what happened in the . . . in the former administration.  

Although we can do that if you want; if you want to get into 

that we can certainly reminisce a little bit.  And that's fair and 

fine. 

 

What we want to do here today is to be open and up front with 

respect to how the Property Management Corporation runs, 

now in the 1990s . . . post the election of 1991.  And I want to 

say with respect to that, that this corporation has a mandate to 

serve government departments and Crowns, and we intend to 

do that. 

 

And we intend to do that in fair and an open way, and as cost 

effectively as we can possibly . . . we can possibly manage.  

And I want to say that we have, as a matter of fact, made some 

changes in Property 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1875 

Management Corporation that are going to substantially save 

money for the people of this province. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Well then if you done so many things -- I 

had some more questions to ask you, but maybe we'll just stop 

right there.  If you've done so many things in Property 

Management to save the taxpayers some money, then tell us.  

Put it on the record; tell us exactly what you're doing and be 

factual. 

 

I mean it's easier for you ministers to stand over there, 

holier-than-thou and say that, we do this and we do that; we do 

it better than you.  And it's easier for you to say, Mr. Minister, 

that, oh I've got less staff than the minister before me or the 

minister when we were in power.  That's like comparing apples 

and oranges, Mr. Minister.  We don't know how many other 

departments he had.  I understand you've just got SPMC and 

Liquor Board.  Is that correct?  Well then, the other minister 

maybe had a lot more.  In fact, I know he did.  So you can't 

compare apples and oranges, whether a minister had eight in 

his staff or six, or whatever. 

 

But let's just go ahead and talk about that for a little while.  

You said you've done such wonderful things, and maybe you're 

right -- and I hope you're right, for the sake of the taxpayer of 

Saskatchewan.  I hope you've made some moves in SPMC to 

save the taxpayer money.  Now just tell us and put it on the 

record and be exact. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- If you're that curious, I say to the 

member from Arm River, I'm going to give you one example of 

how we saved the province of Saskatchewan some money.  We 

closed down the premier's office in Prince Albert, and in the 

premier's office in Prince Albert worked one Gordon 

Dobrowolsky -- and I'm sure you're well aware of him.  Well 

since we closed down the premier's office in Prince Albert, we 

were able to save some money, not only on future rent and 

office furniture and utilities, but we were able to save the cost 

of the salary of Gordon Dobrowolsky, and we've done that.  

And that's part of a payment of $629,922 that the Property 

Management Corporation was paying for employees who didn't 

work at Property Management Corporation or work in the 

minister's office as part of the minister's budget, through that.  

So we saved the people of this province a few dollars on Mr. 

Dobrowolsky's salary.  We, I think, did a fairly good job. 

 

I understand there was two staff working in the Future 

Corporation that were billed to SPMC.  Well they're no longer 

paid by SPMC so we've saved the people of Saskatchewan 

some money on that. 

 

We've, I think, done a number of things in terms of positions.  

We've embarked on some early retirements and we've managed 

to reduce, in '93-94, 20 positions through attrition.  And I think 

those are all important things. 

And the downsizing of this government is important in terms of 

getting control of our debt, getting control of the provincial 

debt, and the amount that we're spending on interest every year.  

And I think all of these things that we've done in the Crown 

corporations and in the line departments, and what we've done 

in terms of consolidating line departments -- and as an 

example, we're consolidating the Liquor Licensing 

Commission and the Liquor Board with the Gaming 

Commission; we expect to save more money there. 

 

I want to say to the member from Arm River, we're not done 

because we think we have a lot of trimming to do in 

government yet.  And I want to say that as we do this trimming 

and as we downsize government and as we save real costs to 

the people of Saskatchewan, this year I am understanding that 

our costs of operating this government are down some 3 per 

cent, and I think that's a very good start.  I think there's a lot 

more we can do, but we're going to continue in that way. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, that all sounds good if it was 

all factual.  Now you're probably cutting down a little bit in, 

like you say, in SPMC.  You make it sound good for the 

listeners out there tonight but you're neglecting to say that we 

still have to have . . . the Premier's got to be elected again. 

 

And so what do you do?  You save a few dollars in SPMC.  

You just said that you saved this and you saved that and you 

closed the Prince Albert office and you got rid of some staff up 

there, but you didn't talk about the $800,000 that's gone to the 

Deputy Premier to be the political boy out there, and who he 

hires. 

 

And you can talk all you want about it.  It sounds good to the 

people out there in Saskatchewan but you don't fool the people 

that know and you're not fooled yourself.  Because you can do 

all the downsizing in government you want.  It costs . . . We 

used to have 23 ministers one time and everybody complained 

so much, went back down to 16.  And it was very little money 

saved because you had to hire more staff.  The 16 ministers 

were so busy they had to have some legislative secretaries. 

 

And you people have got extra money. You hire . . . you find 

out that the ministerial staff, the Executive Council, why you're 

not having your people paid out of Executive Council is 

because the Executive Council figure will be too high.  We'll 

get on that with the Premier when we get there, why he's trying 

to keep his Executive Council price tag down so they pay your 

department out of SPMC. 

 

So don't think that you're fooling people out there saying, oh 

we're cutting down the size of government, cutting down here.  

That only puts a drop in the bucket of the $15 billion that you 

people left for us to take over in 1982. 

 

You sound so . . . and your people know that I'm right on it 

because I'm going to have this sent over to you.  I'm going to 

send it to every minister that I talk to until this House closes.  

And it shows you right there that where this here deficit that 

we're trying to save, and 



1876 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

the smoke and mirrors that you're going through . . . and you've 

seen that before.  Your own Deputy Premier that sits right in 

front of you there, he says that we know it's $5 billion, but it's . 

. . actually he admits there was a $3.5 billion debt that we took 

over in 1982 and he admits it, from the total from the 

departments, the Crowns, and it's admitted and it's a fact.  If 

you take $3.5 billion in 1982 and put it to 1993 figures, you got 

14-some-billion dollars debt.  And if you don't understand it, 

I'll explain it to you, if you don't understand it.  Because 

everything you say, every minister that I've heard talking on 

estimates is always going back that we have to have our 

cut-backs, we've got to do this because of the Tory deficit that 

was left by you, this legacy we took over from us. 

 

Well I'll tell you, for us to take over that 3.5 billion  -- we think 

it's 4.8, but it's admitted by 3.5 -- admitted by when he was the 

minister of Finance and that was under Appropriation Bill in 

June 1992, and now that's a fact.  So you tried to make people 

think that this is all . . . You've misled the people in 

Saskatchewan.  You said that we left -- and I'm not saying you 

particular, because you weren't a cabinet minister at that time 

and you weren't out, maybe as some people in the front row, 

saying to people that we have absolutely left them a balanced 

budget and we're going to get these figures out to 

Saskatchewan.  It's getting out there fast because people are 

very, very surprised. 

 

And the reason why I bring it up even in your estimates, I was 

going to bring it up on the other minister and I neglected to.  

Every minister that we have estimates left, I'm going to tell him 

to read this and read it carefully and quit telling the people of 

Saskatchewan that you left us absolutely a zero deficit because 

you didn't.  It's just exactly like if I, Mr. Minister, if I buy a 

farm or a business for $100,000 and I pay for it and think it's all 

right, then fine, there's another 100,000 tag goes along with it.  

And that's exactly what you people left us. 

 

So every time we ask you a question why you cut back, why 

you fired people, why . . . Every time you speak, every time 

even the ministers speak in question period or whatever, we 

have to get this little lesson because we're doing it because you 

people done it to us.  Well it's not true.  You misled all of 

Saskatchewan. 

 

So don't stand there and tell me that you're doing this . . . 

holier-than-thou way you're answering here tonight, that oh, 

we're cutting back on SPMC and you didn't put a figure on it. 

 

So I want a figure in dollars and cents because if you're . . . 

Like I asked the minister this afternoon if he knew how much 

money was saved from the 289 cut-backs. Then he didn't know.  

Well if you don't know what you're saving by getting rid of 289 

employees -- putting them practically on to welfare, that's 

where they're going if they can't get another job -- and you 

don't know the figure, what did you do it for? 

 

So tell us exactly what the figures that you're saying . . . 

because you brought it up, I didn't.  What are the dollars and 

cents saved at SPMC by these here little 

cut-backs you're talking about? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, I'd be more than 

willing to do that.  We've reduced SPMC's budget by 24 per 

cent to $133.2 million, $5.9 million or 4.2 per cent in '93-94 

alone.  And I want to just, if I can, just talk for a few minutes 

about how we did that. 

 

In '92-93, SPMC had 70 occupied positions and 107 vacant 

positions eliminated and that saved the corporation in the 

neighbourhood of $3 million.  We implemented new cleaning 

standards and eliminated private cleaning contracts and that 

resulted in a saving of 1.3 million.  We introduced an energy 

management program that saved the corporation in the 

neighbourhood of $200,000 a year. 

 

Now $200,000 is maybe not an awful lot of money in the 

bigger scheme of things.  But when you add the 200,000's and 

you started adding them together and you come up with a nice 

little tidy sum.  And that's how we've been able to cut back on 

government expenditures, just a few of those things. 

 

We downsized in the '92-93 budget and we abolished the 177 

positions and that required 70 lay-offs of staff in May 5 of '92.  

We took a look at the space of Property Management 

Corporation's head office and we moved from 2045 Broad 

Street which was leased space, to 1940 Lorne Street which is 

government owned space.  And our calculations are that we 

saved in the neighbourhood of $700,000 a year just on that one 

move alone. 

 

And I say to the member from Arm River, I think there's . . . 

and you're a businessman, you're a farmer, a businessman as I 

am, and I think you understand the need of putting the nickels 

together to make the dollars to make the bank account balance.  

You've been in this House a lot longer than I have and clearly a 

much more experienced member, but I know that you 

understand that concept and I believe that's the way you run 

your business as I attempt to run mine. 

 

And I don't think there's any secret to government.  I don't think 

there's any secret to knowing how much your revenues and 

trying to do a reasonable forecast as to how much your 

revenues are and having a close look at your expenditures on an 

annual basis to see where you can trim those little frills. 

 

And I don't want to refer to the 70 positions that we eliminated 

as being frivolous because they're not.  They're a very serious 

impact and those are very tough decisions that government has 

made in terms of getting the cost of government in hand.  So I 

just say that we've got more examples of things that we have 

done to cut the cost of operating this corporation and I'm more 

than willing to share them with you. 

 

But I guess I will just finish my answer by saying that we've 

reduced by 24 per cent the cost of operating this corporation.  

We brought it down some 24 per cent, to around $133 million.  

I think that's a real good accomplishment. 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1877 

And I want to say, as a matter of fact I had a meeting with the 

Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation management 

team just this week, and it was one of the things that was 

brought to my attention.  We talked about the possibility of 

increasing the savings to the government by the delivery of 

services the Property Management Corporation does.  And Mr. 

Law brought to my attention -- and that's why I know these 

figures -- the fact that the Property Management Corporation 

has in fact done a fairly reasonable job in terms of doing its 

share in working to get the provincial deficit under control. 

 

(1945) 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Chairman, Mr. Minister, yes, I thank 

you for that information.  And if it turns out to be that way and 

you're saving that kind of dollars and cents, then I appreciate 

your remarks, and I'll congratulate you for it, because that's 

what we want you to do, is the saving of money for the 

taxpayers of Saskatchewan. 

 

Because we all know in this last few years we're going into a 

serious economic . . . we're in it, very serious economic 

conditions.  And if you can do that . . . but I just hope it doesn't 

turn out that you just put figures together.  And I'm not going to 

doubt your word.  I don't know you very well, but the minister 

of PSC this afternoon, he maybe just made a mistake, but did 

give me wrong information.  I hope your information is right 

for the sake of the taxpayers of Saskatchewan. 

 

So I'm going to . . . I've just got one more question on your 

staff and then I'm going to move to a different kind of questions 

entirely.  I believe that an Andrew Thomson -- he's the highest 

paid of your staff -- is doing constituency work while being 

paid out of SPMC.  How do you explain that, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I should 

correct the member in terms of Mr. Thomson's role.  He attends 

the constituency work with me when I return on constituency 

business.  We have in my riding -- no different than many other 

ridings -- people who are concerned and who are interested in 

the functioning and the way the corporations under my 

purview, under my portfolio operate, and he attends to 

meetings with me in my constituency.  His home town is Prince 

Albert, so I'm assuming he gets home on weekends; I don't 

check with him that closely, in terms of when he goes home.  

But I can say this to you: Mr. Thomson is not paid to do 

political work in my home community and when he's on 

government time, he does government business.  That's what 

he's paid to do, and that's what I expect from all of my staff. 

 

To suggest that these people are never back in my riding would 

be inaccurate because that's not true.  We have, as all MLAs 

do, I have a joint constituency office with two other MLAs 

from the area; that's where a lot of local concerns are raised.  

But a lot of times there becomes a question by one of my 

constituents, and on occasion by one of your constituents, to 

which Mr. Thomson will attend.  And that's his function, 

that's what he gets paid for and that's what he does. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Chairman, Mr. Minister, I thank you for 

that.  We've asked many ministers those kind of questions, and 

I've been here, like you know, quite a few years -- I was four 

years in opposition before and now I'm back in opposition -- 

and not too many ministers will answer as straightforward as 

you did there, and I thank you for it.  You've admitted that he 

does constituency work and there's nothing wrong with that.  

So if he's not doing it on government time, that's . . . I like to 

give credit when credit is due, so if you're saying that and I 

believe you, and I call that an honest answer. 

 

So, Mr. Minister, we're going to ask you some other questions 

here.  Do any of your assistants travel in conducting their 

work?  Like . . . (inaudible) . . . please provide me with the total 

your department has spent on ministerial assistant travel 

expenses.  Do you have answers you can give me to that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, as the member will 

know, I haven't been in this portfolio that long, and so the 

travel costs that would have been charged to the Property 

Management Corporation are not that large.  I can pass across 

my costs, my travel costs, as well.  All I have is for the month 

of March, which is a partial figure.  I haven't got April or May's 

with us.  We can attempt to get that for you. 

 

So there are two flights that I have taken at $125 each; there's 

one for $105, and I don't know . . . No, there's one from the 

former minister, $105 to attend meetings with a CVA (central 

vehicle agency) car.  Sean Caragata, parking costs $3, parking 

costs $3.  And I believe this would have been by the former 

minister's assistant, meetings in Saskatoon and North Battleford 

for 84.95 for a total of $449.30.  So if you'd like, I can pass that 

across, or if you want to take it from Hansard, whatever. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Chairman, Mr. Minister, just for the 

sake of time here, I'm going to just include my request at once, 

and you can just take it out of Hansard tomorrow and just give 

it to us later on.  This is what I want. 

 

I would like full details . . . what I'm asking . . . the time period 

that I want this for is not while you've been minister, for the 

office because there is going to be a minister before you, so 

naturally I want it for the year that we're talking in question 

here, the year of the budget year.  I would like full details of 

this travel including the assistants' name, total cost per trip, the 

purpose of the travel, mode of travel, who they accompanied, 

the minister or departmental officials, and destination. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, and I 

certainly didn't attempt to mislead the member.  The figures 

that I read into the record were for the whole fiscal year, and I 

was not aware.  We thought that they were for the month of 

March.  But I'm led to believe that these are for the whole year, 

but we can certainly pass that information that you've requested 



1878 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

on to you. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  I've already asked 

you the question.  You gave it the report about your own 

ministerial travel in which you haven't been a minister that 

long, so that's fine.  But your departmental staff now -- that's in 

the department now -- what is the total number employed at 

SPMC? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, to answer the 

member's question, the exact number as of March 31, 1993, is 

1,045 employees and that's down from March 31, 1992, from 

1,142 employees.  So it's roughly a decrease of 100 employees. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  What is the total 

salary paid to these people?  And if you've got several officials 

there, so maybe I can ask several questions at once here to 

speed things up.  What is the total salary paid to these people?  

What was the total employed last year . . . but you already gave 

me that information.  What was the total salary last year?  Have 

you got that straight, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, maybe just to speed 

this up, this is all part of the parcel that I just sent over.  But I'll 

certainly read it into the record.  The salary for '93 was 

$34,080,513; for the previous year, for '92, the figure was 

$41,708,854, roughly a decrease of $7 million. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  Yes, when I ask a 

question that's in this material you gave me, you just have to 

remind me because I have no way could I get through it to see 

what's there.  And I think you understand that. 

 

I'm just going to ask a question about the Echo Valley 

Conference Centre.  What is the status of Echo Valley 

Conference Centre? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, just to give a brief 

update with respect to the Echo Valley Conference Centre, we 

are still in the process of negotiations.  We are really quite 

encouraged by the comments from the officials in the federal 

department of defence.  We are certainly hopeful that the 

federal government will follow through with the proposal as we 

have put forth to them.  We think, as many people do, that it's a 

very good proposal.  It's good for Saskatchewan and it's good 

for the people who would use the conference centre.  So we 

were, as I said, very encouraged by the remarks and statements 

made by the federal department of defence and we're certainly 

hopeful that we'll be in a position to make a public 

announcement soon. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, was there a federal . . . was the 

federal government involved in that negotiations or contract? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well as the member may be aware, 

there was a statement made by federal officials some weeks 

ago who had indicated that they felt the process of negotiations 

was very fruitful and that we 

were going to be very shortly in a position to sign a contract. 

 

What we were looking for when we looked at the Echo Valley 

Centre was a low-cost conference centre so that we could 

entice people, different groups who come into the province.  

And it certainly seemed to us that the Department of National 

Defence was just a real legitimate candidate with respect to the 

cadets and the types of facilities that they look for. 

 

And this is why we entered into negotiations with the federal 

government.  And quite clearly there have been negotiations 

and we're certainly hopeful that we can make an announcement 

in the near future. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, thank you.  Now I understand 

in July of 1992 the government announced that they were 

negotiating the sale of Echo Valley Conference Centre but that 

it was being held up by the Star Blanket Indian Band who made 

a claim to the property as part of a land entitlement.  What is 

happening with this? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, the caveat by the 

Star Blanket Band is still in place and will remain in place 

while we're in the process of negotiations with the federal 

government, the discussions with the local communities, and 

with the Indian bands as well.  So we are, as I've indicated, 

hopeful that we can find a speedy resolve to this issue. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, okay, that's okay for that.  But 

I have a couple of questions here on some SPMC legal battles 

that you're involved in.  Rod Hiltz, 17 years of experience at 

SPMC, was fired when the NDP (New Democratic Party) took 

office in 1991.  Where is this court case at? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- As the member will know, this 

issue is before the court so there is limited information that I 

can share other than what is public knowledge, frankly. 

 

And I'm told that there was an examination for discovery on 

May 19 in 1992.  There was a pre-trial conference held on 

November 13 of '92 without settlement.  And I understand that 

the matter will now proceed to the courts.  And there's -- as I 

understand it -- a date set for early June in Prince Albert. 

 

(2000) 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  The other one 

was Ray -- and I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right or not -- 

Ray Fiaber, F-i-a-b-e-r, was also fired and also took your 

government to court.  Where's this case at or is it in the same 

position? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- I'm told that the examination for 

discovery was originally scheduled to start on January 26, 

1993.  But to date, no examination for discovery has been held.  

And I'm led to believe that negotiations are still ongoing. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  Just a 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1879 

question.  I'm pretty near through asking questions, and the 

member for Morse is going to ask some of you.  My last 

question I'm going to ask you, Mr. Minister, is on executive air.  

Mr. Minister, please provide total monies spent on executive air 

flight within the province for the past year. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, I don't have the 

exact numbers here, but we can get those to you.  What I do 

have here are the approved amounts for executive air for 

1992-93: 1.326 million.  And for the '93-94 year, in the budget 

there is approved $1.117 million.  But I'll get the exact figure in 

terms of how much the actual costs of running executive air 

were in the last year. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Yes, Mr. Minister, I would appreciate it you 

could get that.  And as well, I'll give you what I want.  I don't 

think you'll have this either.  Please provide totals for each 

minister as well.  You should be able to put a breakdown on 

that.  Maybe you have that now; I don't know.  You could get 

us that information if you haven't got it now. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, I'll pass across a list 

with a breakdown of the amount that the individual ministers 

have charged to executive air . . . or have had charged by 

executive air, as well as the amount that were spent on charters.  

But I can tell you that the total aggregate is $200,696 for all of 

the travel. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  I'd like to have a 

breakdown please, if you would, if you could give me a 

breakdown on the out-of-province flights over the last year per 

minister.  Will you be able to provide that also? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, we have the amounts 

billed.  We don't have them with us here, but for the 

out-of-province travel done by executive air, we have those 

figures available and we can supply those to you. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  Another question: 

do any of the ministers use other companies for flights? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, and to the member 

from Arm River, that's included in the amount that you have 

there on charters.  That's the total aggregate amount that is 

spent on executive air and on charters as well. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  How much staff 

is employed at exec air?  What is the amount budgeted for 

salaries out there? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- We're just looking those figures up.  

If you want to ask another question and then we can get that 

answer to you as soon as we find them. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Minister, 

yes, I just have one last question while they're looking that up.  

It's kind of a ticklish question; I hate to even ask it but I have 

to.  We understand that 

Transport Canada is currently investigating executive air.  Is it 

true that the pilot and engineer are under investigation for fraud 

and that they have been suspended with pay until the 

investigation is over?  If this is true, how much of the 

taxpayers' money is going toward each of these individual 

salaries?  In addition, how much money are they accused of 

stealing? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, I have the answers 

here with respect to the salaries and benefits.  The aggregate 

amount is $513,200, and the number of employees are 11.  And 

I'll get an answer to you with respect to your last question. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Minister, did 

I hear accurately that your salary is being paid by SPMC, the 

amount of money that is coming for your ministerial salary? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just 

want to . . . in answer to the member from Arm River's question 

with respect to executive aircraft.  There is an investigation 

ongoing by the Department of Transport, and pending the 

results of that investigation, two employees have been 

suspended with pay.  We are awaiting the Department of 

Transport to come in with the results of their investigation, and 

as I've indicated there are two employees that are suspended 

with pay until the results of that comes in. 

 

With respect to the ministerial salary, I may have been in error 

to the member from Morse.  I'm told by my officials that 

ministerial salaries come from Executive Council or from the 

Legislative Assembly.  The MLA salary for sure comes from 

the Legislative Assembly Office, but the ministerial salary, I 

guess, if all ministerial salaries come from Executive Council, 

then this would be no different.  But I can double check that 

just to be sure. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Well there is, Mr. Minister, a significant 

difference in my view from where it would be coming.  That's 

why I was interested in your answer that you gave earlier.  

Your car, is that . . . your CVA vehicle, is that supplied by 

SPMC? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, it is, Mr. Member. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Would you provide back to me the answer for 

the question I raised about the ministerial salary at some point 

in time so that we can know who's paying that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, we will.  We'll get back to you 

with that answer. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I listened with some interest regarding the 

information you provided about how you rationalized your 

staffing and the payments through SPMC.  How do you 

rationalize and justify the work of your staff that work for . . . 

responsibilities as you suggested about constituency work 

being paid for by SPMC?  And how do your rationalize those 

that work in doing responsibility as it relates to the Liquor 



1880 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

Board and then being paid for by SPMC? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, the member from 

Morse, I don't want him to misinterpret what I referred to as 

constituency work.  I guess what I'm saying is that from time to 

time I will deal with, as a minister, issues that arise in my 

constituency, as well as yours and the member from Arm 

River. 

 

It is not, as you will know, having been a member of Executive 

Council, an uncommon occurrence for ministerial assistants to 

travel with the ministers as part of their duties.  And my 

ministerial staff acts in certainly no different fashion.  In terms 

of constituency work, that's what I refer to. 

 

On government time my ministerial assistants are expected to 

do . . . perform their duties, as I have outlined to the member 

from Arm River.  They are designated and I have no reason to 

believe that they perform in any other fashion.  If you have any 

evidence or any indication that members of my staff have been 

acting inappropriately, I will deal with that in the appropriate 

fashion. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I'm not concerned about it.  I know how that 

works and I understand the value they are as you go about your 

business and realizing that you have to have some connection 

with your office regardless of where you are, and it's important 

that you have a person that realizes on that responsibility.  I 

have no problem with that. 

 

I just wanted to know how you rationalize the SPMC paying 

for that, and what's your rationale for doing that?  And also, 

how do you rationalize the SPMC paying for the Liquor Board 

work that you do and the Gaming Commission that you do?  

That's the question I had. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well I guess in order to justify this, 

I should perhaps maybe do a little history.  As you will know, 

the Property Management Corporation began in 1986.  Prior to 

that, it operated as a line department for a number of different 

reasons.  And I still to this day don't understand why the need 

to design and to put in place a Crown corporation. 

 

But I do know that the costs to turn it back to a line department, 

I'm told, would be in the neighbourhood of a quarter of a 

million dollars, which I would see to be, at this point in our 

province's history, a waste of money because it performs the 

same function as a Crown corporation as it would if it were a 

line department. 

 

And I take you back to the history of the corporation as it 

related to its life as a line department.  It was called Supply and 

Services, Public Works, Government Services, but whatever 

name it was under, it still basically performed the same 

function. 

 

Now Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation isn't a 

line department; it's a Crown corporation.  But whether it's 

Crown or whether it's a line department, the appropriateness of 

a line 

department paying for ministerial staff, I think really is no 

different than the Saskatchewan Property Management 

Corporation paying the salaries of ministerial staff. 

 

Now you may disagree with that, but I think if you look at the 

history of this Crown corporation, and if you look at the legal 

aspects as to whether it's legal, you may argue that the 

Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation shouldn't be 

a Crown corporation, that it should in fact be turned back to a 

line department.  And I guess other than the cost effectiveness 

and the costs of doing that, I would at this point tend not to 

agree.  But whether it's a line department, whether it's a Crown 

corporation, the function is the same.

And the ministerial staff are paid by the Crown corporation as 

they would be if Saskatchewan Property Management Corp 

was a line department.  So really the only difference from prior 

to 1986 may be the number of ministerial staff, and we can 

debate that too, but I think what is important is the history of 

this Crown, what its function is, and whether or not it's 

appropriate to pay ministerial staff from this Crown 

corporation.  You will say to me that you believe it's not.  Well 

I take you through the history, and I say in terms of the legality 

of it, there's certainly no problem. 

 

In terms of the appropriateness of ministerial staff being paid 

by a Crown or a line department, historically that's the way it's 

been done.  So I would say other than whether we want to 

debate whether or not we turn it back to a line department, I 

guess just cost is probably where I might disagree. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Well, Mr. Minister, I never inferred or 

implied that it should go back to a line department or wherever, 

and the history.  I just know that sitting in Crown Corporations 

Committee, every time there was a minister who had 

ministerial staff paid for by a Crown corporation, the ridicule 

and derision that came from members of that Crown 

Corporations Committee who were on your side of the 

government was interesting.  And the reason that it's interesting 

today, Mr. Minister, is that you are taking individuals from a 

Crown corporation and having them sit in your office, and that 

is what I find really interesting. 

 

As a matter of fact, if you rationalize yourself into that kind of 

a position because it used to be a line department, let me just 

read into the record or give the public an overview of Sask 

Water Corporation.  Sask Water Corporation was a part of 

Department of Environment, was a part of the Department of 

Agriculture, was a part of Urban Affairs, and I even forget the 

other department that it was a part of.  And that, Mr. Minister, 

is a fact. 

 

Now if you want to use the rationalization in determining that 

because at one time it was Revenue and Financial Services, 

that's the reason and the rationale for doing it, I never ever said 

it was wrong.  It was you and your party that said it was the 

wrong 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1881 

thing to do.  And now you're turning around and you're making 

that point to us and saying, well because it was this and this and 

that, that rationalizes the decision you made to have your 

ministerial staff paid for by a Crown corporation. 

 

You said you would never do it.  I didn't say you shouldn't, but 

you said you wouldn't do it.  And I say if your salary comes 

from Executive Council, then in the rationalization and the 

determination of Executive Council doing the job and doing the 

job right, you should take that into consideration and have that 

ministerial staff paid for by Executive Council because that's 

what you decided you wanted to have done.  And you said you 

would never, ever pay ministerial staff out of a Crown 

corporation. 

 

Now that's the part that is really interesting coming from this 

side of the House.  And the media reported it also as being a 

very interesting observation.  You probably could rationalize 

every one of the Crown corporations into that very same 

instance.  You could probably do it with SGI (Saskatchewan 

Government Insurance). 

 

I'll just raise two more for you, sir.  Crop Insurance 

Corporation today is a Crown corporation.  Crop Insurance is 

now a part of the Department of Agriculture.  So the Minister 

of Agriculture, in the same arguments you just used, could say, 

well I need somebody in the Crop Insurance Corporation to 

give me assistance in the Crown corporation, because he may 

need some expertise that is exactly as it relates to the Crown 

corporation called Sask Crop Insurance.  You could rationalize 

the same thing with Ag Credit Corporation.  Exactly the same 

arguments. 

 

And yet you turn it around and say that one time it was bad, it 

was the wrong thing to do, and now you turn around and say, 

well because I do it, it's right.  And that, Mr. Minister, is what I 

want the public to know is that you are doing contrary to what 

you said you were going to do. 

 

And that's why I wanted to have the rationalization and how 

you justified the option that you made available to yourself and 

to the other members of Executive Council.  And your 

rationalization, I have no problem with it.  In fact, that's how 

every one of us rationalized that decision in times gone by.  

However, you said you'd never do it, and that's the difference. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't want to 

be argumentative.  As the member knows, we've spent long 

hours in this legislature, you and I, and rarely we get into much 

of an encounter, but on this one I think we have to disagree. 

 

I think the issue, I say to the member from Morse, is 

accountability.  And I remember well the debate in Crown 

Corporations and in Crown corporation estimates.  And the 

debate at that time was not in so much as who paid the 

ministerial assistants, but whether or not there was 

accountability for the ones that were paid, and whether the 

general public were aware of who worked in these Crowns and 

how much 

they were paid. 

 

Well clearly today we've opened up the salaries of ministerial 

assistants, not only Property Management Corporation, but 

Agriculture and Health and all of them.  We publish on a 

regular basis any promotions that ministerial assistants receive, 

and I think that's a very positive step.  With respect to 

accountability, as you will know, the Property Management 

Corporation reports to the Committee of Finance; that's what 

we're doing here.  There's a open forum where you can ask 

questions.  You can ask about the ministerial staff, what their 

role is, how much they're paid, and I think that's good, and 

that's the way it should be. 

 

This corporation also reports to Crown Corporations, so in 

some ways we're even more accountable, I guess, than what a 

line department would be, say, as an example, the Department 

of Agriculture which only reports to the Committee of Finance.  

Property Management Corporation, I repeat, reports not only 

here but to Crown Corporations. 

 

With respect to your question on ministerial payment, it does 

and is a line item.  It's under vote 10, Executive Council.  And I 

believe it's on page 51.  And my ministerial salary would be 

included in that. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I haven't got my book.  On page 51, is that the 

vote that deals with the Crown corporation SPMC or is that a 

separate item that deals specifically as an Executive Council 

payment to the minister's office? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- To the member, it's on page 51 

under Executive Council, vote 10, item 6, titled "Members of 

the Executive Council (Authorized by Law) (Subvote EX06)." 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  I want to ask a few 

questions about CVA vehicles.  How many have you purchased 

this year, and did you take a volume that had asked for bids on 

these cars or vehicles that you purchased?  I'd like to know how 

many you purchased and for what price and whether it was 

tendered and when it was done. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, the answer to the 

member's question is that we purchased 292 vehicles for a total 

amount of 4.5 million, and it was tendered. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- How many suppliers did the 292 vehicles 

come from? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- We can get back with that 

information.  I don't have that here, but we can get that to you. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Would you be able to provide me the volume 

of dollars for each of the bids that were received for each of the 

vehicle dealerships that received the bid? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, we'd be happy to 



1882 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

supply that. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- In that information I'll find out how many 

were purchased in Prince Albert too, I guess.  And that's only 

good business, Mr. Minister.  The office space in the province . 

. . Well first of all I'll go back to these vehicles.  Can you give 

me a description of what kinds of vehicles they were, the types 

of vehicles, whether they were trucks for Parks or cars or just 

exactly the details of each of that 292 volume? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  1993 

vehicles ordered were three compact sedans, 26 . . . no, three 

sub-compacts, 26 compacts, 34 mid-size sedans, 41 mid-sized 

wagons and mini vans, 2 full-size sedans, 2 full-size wagons, 

26 compact pickups, 48 cargo vans, 13 personnel carriers, 10 

four-by-four pickups, 44 two-wheel drive pickups, 41 one-ton 

trucks, and 2 one-ton trucks, I assume that would be . . . 2 

two-ton trucks. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Were these purchases made on behalf of all of 

government, the line departments and Crown corporations, or 

just line departments and SPMC? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- The list is too long, in terms of the 

ones that we supply.  We don't have that now.  But we can get 

that to you, in terms of who we've supplied vehicles to. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Okay. You are referring to individuals who 

you supply the cars to, and within the framework of the line 

departments, that's the response that you gave me?  I'm not sure 

just what it was that you suggested. 

 

What I wanted to have was the volumes of cars that are 

purchased not only by SPMC, but is there a group of vehicles 

that you would buy for SaskPower Corporation or SaskTel or 

any of those Crown corporations?  And that's what I wanted the 

information on.  And the details of that I'd like to have 

provided. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We do 

supply to SaskTel.  We don't supply to SaskPower.  So it's not 

all of the Crown corporations that Property Management 

Corporation supplies, but we do supply all of the line 

departments and some of the Crowns.  And the aggregate 

amount of vehicles that we've purchased on behalf of those 

who have used Property Management Corporation is 292. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I'd like a list of all those Crown corporations 

and the vehicles also that you supply to them and then have on 

hand.  That would be information that would be of value to us 

too, so that if you supply them for SaskTel, you should have a 

certain volume of vehicles that you have available.  And I'd like 

you to provide that for us, if you don't mind. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- That's no problem. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Can you provide for us the aggregate 

volume of office space that you have in the province of 

Saskatchewan along with the amounts that there would be in 

certain locations?  Can you provide that if it's, let's say, in 

Regina that you have X amount of space in Regina, and then 

have occupied and unoccupied; in North Battleford, occupied 

and unoccupied; and going throughout the province?  Can you 

do that for us? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, we can supply that for you. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Would you also provide to me or for us a list 

of the furniture that you supplied to the various agencies in the 

province of Saskatchewan.  I'd like to have that list, too, if you 

could.  

 

(2030) 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- In response to the member from 

Morse's question, we're purchasing $50,000.  As I understand 

it, that's the figure. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I didn't quite hear you.  You purchased 50,000 

or . . . 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- In '93-94 we'll be purchasing 

$50,000 worth of furniture. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Fifty thousand dollars worth of furniture in 

'93.  What's the inventory that is on hand in the province on 

furniture?  Do you have any inventory volume or do you do an 

inventory volume at the conclusion of every year for . . . an 

inventory for SPMC on office furniture and including chairs, 

tables, desks, computers, and all of those kinds of things? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- To the member from Morse, what I 

can give you is the depreciated value in 1992 was 5.039 

million.  When inventory was transferred to the corporation in 

1986-87 when the corporation was established, there was no 

inventory taken of the furniture that was moved in, so we have 

no way to base any kind of an inventory base.  So all we can do 

is account for what we purchase on an annual basis and we 

depreciate that in the appropriate way. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- You mean to tell me that you don't have an 

inventory supply list of the $5 million worth of assets that you 

have on hand, that you know that you've got 6,000 typewriters 

and 3,000 computers and all of that sort of thing -- you mean 

you don't have that list available so that you know what kind of 

an inventory base you've got? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well as I've explained to the 

member, in 1986-87 when the former administration put this 

corporation into place, there was no inventory taken of what 

came from the line departments.  And subsequent to that, there 

isn't a piece-by-piece inventory in terms of 16 desks, 17 desks.  

It's an aggregate figure and it's depreciated by the age of . . . I 

would understand by the age of the equipment that is 

purchased.  But as it is, there's no itemized inventory list.  It's 

an aggregate figure that was handled in the same fashion as the 

former 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1883 

administration handled it. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Okay, I don't have a problem with that.  What 

I wanted to tell you, though, is that I just received information 

saying that all of the MLAs' equipment and office supplies and 

all of that is going to be identified now.  And everybody who is 

sitting in this Assembly is going to have to identify every piece 

of furniture that he bought from supplies made available to a 

member.  And we're going to identify every one and you're 

going to keep an inventory list of that and you're not even 

going to keep an inventory list of what you've been doing for 

the last 10 years or eight years. 

 

And so on the one hand you're asking us to supply you a list of 

goods and services purchased with the allowances paid for by 

members or to members in lieu of providing a service to 

constituencies.  And on the other hand you don't provide . . . 

take that same dynamic and make it available and require that 

office supplies in offices around the province and that they 

don't have an inventory list.  You tell me which business runs 

that way. 

 

You got $5 million worth of assets. You don't know whether 

you got $3 million worth of assets in overhead projectors and 

movie screens or slide screens and slide projectors and all of 

those kinds of things. You don't have any idea what you've got.  

And I would say that maybe it's time you did an inventory list 

in order to establish what you have there.  Making the MLAs 

accountable is a reasoned approach and I have no problem with 

that.  However, the reason I ask, you're going to have MLAs be 

required to do that and you're not going to have government 

employees required to do that and I think you need to have both 

of that happen. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, to answer the 

member's question, the Property Management Corporation has 

looked at this.  The cost as they estimate it would be in the 

neighbourhood of a half a million dollars to do an inventory 

and then to maintain from that would be, I would assume, 

another cost.  But let me say with respect to inventorying 

MLAs' office furniture, I think that it's a positive thing that the 

Board of Internal Economy has done. 

 

I think the members of the legislature have shown some 

leadership, and I would want to say as well to the member 

opposite that two members of his caucus sit on that board and 

supported the inventorying.  So I'm really pleased to see that 

they will support the new direction of this government with 

accountability and doing the right accounting procedures. 

 

I want to say that I am sure the Property Management 

Corporation would have undertaken an inventory had the 

budget pressures not been as extreme as they are.  Hopefully in 

1994 we can find within the budget of the Property 

Management Corporation half a million dollars to do the 

inventory and an analysis of the inventory that may satisfy your 

desire for an accountable government which I can say to you 

that all members of this side share.  Hopefully when we 

alleviate some of the budget pressures that this government is 

operating under, we can accomplish an inventory list for the 

furniture that Property Management Corporation manages. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Well, Mr. Minister, I think that you are 

neglecting your responsibility as a minister in not having 

provided to the . . . and have your staff receive and require 

from offices all the way across this province the amount of 

equipment, the services provided in each of those locations, 

because you don't know how many overhead projectors you've 

got.  And you don't know how many you need.  Somebody just 

told you you have to order three new ones. 

 

So I say to you it's going to be money saved by understanding, 

first of all, your inventory list, your inventory supply, and then 

making these supplies available to other agencies when they're 

required, and then they won't have to buy them.  So if you've 

got two in one office and none in the other, you can move one 

over. 

 

And I say to you, Mr. Minister, that it's time to consider that as 

an option because I believe that it's an important part of 

maintaining supply and an inventory.  Just the same way as you 

know just about every vehicle that you have on hand, it is 

significant also to know how many computers you have on 

hand and how many you don't need and how many you should 

get rid of, in each one of those areas.  And I think you need to 

have that inventory and an inventory control of that, equally as 

well with your staff as you do with everyone else in the 

province, and I think it's absolutely necessary. 

 

I even believe that you could save money and you could 

rationalize the decision to have that inventory control dealt 

with.  You could save money doing it and save the province 

money in capital expenditures in relation to those items in that 

inventory. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well I guess maybe I should clarify 

because I think we're lumping a lot of different items here 

together.  And I want to say that each department keeps a list of 

computers, typewriters, all of the electronic equipment of that 

nature.  And what I was referring here to was just office 

furniture, desks, maybe room dividers, tables, those kinds of 

things. 

 

But I want to say that I commend the member for his 

suggestion because I think it's a good suggestion and I think it 

makes sense.  And a former minister's Property Management 

Corporation had thought . . . had you been, when the former 

administration was in power, perhaps the minister of Property 

Management Corporation, you could have had this done.  But I 

want to say that it's operated since 1986 without that inventory. 

 

I think it makes some good sense and I'm going to ask the 

officials to have a very close look at the costing and what it 

might cost to do an inventory on this office furniture as we do 

keep an inventory with computers and typewriters.  And I think 

it's a good idea and I'm 



1884 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

taking your suggestion under advisement. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Another question I want to ask you.  When 

arrangements were made prior to moving the assets and the 

liabilities of health facilities out of Property Management 

Corporation into the Consolidated Fund and the debt was 

moved there, municipalities throughout the province 

cost-shared the construction of acute care side of each one of 

those facilities in an integrated facility.  And the municipalities 

paid 50 per cent of the assets of the Cabri Prairie Health Care 

Centre on the acute care side; they paid 15 per cent on the 

long-term care side. 

 

Do you have any record of those facilities in the province of 

Saskatchewan today where the municipalities have assets in 

those health care facilities?  And would you be able to provide 

us a cost -- no, a value -- that was provided in money that was 

given to the people of Saskatchewan by RMs (rural 

municipality), by towns, and the volume of dollars that was 

contributed in each of those cases?  Would you be able to 

provide that to us? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Chairman, and to the member 

from Morse, we have a breakdown of the debt load on each of 

those facilities, but Property Management Corporation doesn't 

keep record of the items that you asked.  That would be a 

responsibility of the Department of Health and I'm advised by 

my officials it would be more appropriately asked under Health 

estimates. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Well, Mr. Minister, I need to be absolutely 

sure that I'm hearing this right.  Each one of those . . . like I'll 

use for example one that wasn't finished.  Coronach, for 

example, wasn't finished and is now being completed and yet 

the acute care side of it, 50 per cent was funded by the RMs 

and the towns in those local communities. 

 

Was the debt transferred to SPMC?  Or from SPMC was it 

transferred to the Consolidated Fund and to the debt of the 

province?  And did at any time those assets go back to the 

Consolidated Fund in a debt and equity?  Or did only the debt 

go over?  And who owns 50 per cent of those acute care 

facilities, and the 52 that are integrated facilities, who owns 

that today?  That's the question I need to have some answers 

on.  And I want to ask you because SPMC provided the 

financing and I need to know the answer to that question. 

 

(2045) 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Mr. Member, I guess you would 

want to look at Property Management Corporation as being the 

lending institution.  In terms of arrangements between the 

Department of Health and a health care facility or a local 

facility, that isn't under the purview of the Property 

Management Corporation.  That has nothing to do with the role 

that the corporation has ever played, so clearly the corporation 

wouldn't have that information available to it.  We can tell you 

how much the debts were owing against it and what has been 

written off through the Consolidated Fund, but those are the 

only figures that 

we would have.  We would have no knowledge of other 

arrangements that were made in communities such as 

Coronach. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Okay, then what I would like to have you 

provide if you can, the volume of dollars that the debt was 

transferred in each of those individual health care facilities.  

Now an integrated facility, for example, like Coronach which is 

an integrated facility, 85 per cent was financed through CMHC 

(Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation) or related; 50 

per cent was financed . . . in the acute care side, 50 per cent was 

financed by SPMC and sometimes Health, and 50 per cent was 

financed by the local community.  In the level 4 care portion of 

that facility, 15 per cent was financed by that community. 

 

Would you be able to provide for me, in the province of 

Saskatchewan, those communities that have that kind of a 

relationship, the amount of money that you transferred to the 

Consolidated Fund as a debt to the province of Saskatchewan.  

And would you be able to do that for me? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, thank you very much.  And to 

the member from Morse, I'm told he already has this 

information that was provided to him in Crown corporation 

estimates.  We only have one copy with us tonight, assuming 

that you would have had your copy with you.  But since you 

haven't brought it, if it's all right with you we can undertake to 

have a page make some copies, and she can take them across to 

you.  This is the only copy we have, otherwise I would 

certainly give it to you. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Does that include the debt of the Sask 

Housing in relation to those facilities and CMHC, or does that 

only include the debt that SPMC had in relation to each one of 

those facilities?  What I guess I would also need to have from 

you if you could -- and you probably do have it some place -- is 

the volume of dollars CMHC has, Sask Housing has, and 

Property Management Corporation, and what the . . . We can 

find out what the communities contributed from the Minister of 

Health. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Well to the hon. member, we are 

trying to be as helpful as we can, but I guess we can only 

present you with and pass on to you what SPMC was involved 

in.  With respect to the other agencies, the appropriate place to 

ask those questions would be under Health estimates.  We deal 

with SPMC business and we'll certainly provide all that we can 

and I see the page just brought it in now, so  . . . and that's the 

only information that we have because those are the only areas 

of involvement that we had. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister. These are advances 

that were made by SPMC to March 31 of 1992. Were there any 

made in 1993 at all? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- That was the end, there were no 

more after that. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- So from that time on it was paid through the 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1885 

Consolidated Fund through the department? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- That's what I understand. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I want to ask the same kind of a question as it 

relates to the University of Saskatchewan.  Do you have those 

same kinds of contributions made by SPMC in relation to the 

volume of dollars that you contribute and had lent the money to 

the agency to supply the facilities in the Ag Building and also I 

think maybe there was a geology building too, but I'd like to 

have those numbers. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- To the hon. member, those are on 

page 5 and 6 of the sheets that I sent to you and that's up until 

the end of the fiscal year.  Those are the only involvement in 

the projects. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I'm not sure that I recall whether you said you 

would undertake to provide the space for me for the different 

centres.  Can you do that for the different centres in the 

province, occupied and unoccupied? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, we'd be more than pleased to 

give you a breakdown of the amount of occupied space, the 

amount of unoccupied space.  And there is some very 

interesting numbers in there. And I hope when we pass them 

across that you have a very close look at them because we're 

really having a serious problem dealing with that particular 

issue. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- On the inventory of vehicles that you've got in 

the province, do you ever have an assessment done of how 

many times those vehicles are used in relation to whether they 

are worth keeping or not. 

 

Do they supply a service to the province?  Do you have a way 

of measuring that when a car isn't being used --  even though it 

may have only 100,000 kilometres -- is it of service to the 

province of Saskatchewan to keep a vehicle like that?  Do you 

do an inventory of those kinds of assessments in your 

deliberations on a day-to-day basis? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- We get an annual report on each 

vehicle on a monthly basis, and by that we can determine if 

there's adequate usage of the vehicle.  That way we know sort 

of where we are with respect to the sort of a time X, and when 

the life span of that car has ended.  And so it's really quite 

important for that number of vehicles that we do have a 

monthly report. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I noticed, Mr. Minister, just recently that there 

was an ad in the paper for some vehicles, and they were I think 

'88s and '89s.  And I wondered if that was the reason why some 

of them were being sold or put up for tender bids.  And if that's 

the case, then I'm comfortable with that.  But I'd like to know 

that. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Most of the vehicles that you see 

advertised, irrespective of what year the vehicle, they've got 

160,000 kilometres and over.  And I guess, weighing the repair 

costs and the maintenance against replacing the vehicle, the 

corporation generally looks at getting rid of them at about 

160,000 kilometres. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. 

Minister.  Just a couple more questions, then we're through.  

Just looking over some of my questions and thought of a few 

more. 

 

Now your government's had massive lay-offs.  What property 

that is not occupied -- that you no longer needed -- how much 

property throughout Saskatchewan that you do not need and it's 

not occupied, and what are you doing with it and how much 

have you . . . 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- To the member from Arm River, 

there's in the neighbourhood of 20,460 square metres that's 

available for relocation that we're looking for other clients and 

other tenants within government to take over at this point. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, is this property that SPMC 

owns or leases?  Owns or leases? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- Yes, it's a mixture of each.  There's 

some leased, some is owned.  As the member may know, we're 

involved in a number of properties that have long-term leases.  

Some of them, we feel, inappropriate with respect to the 

amount that the market will bear, and some of that is in our 

inventory.  It's space that we would rather not have, but 

because of decisions to purchase for whatever particular 

reasons, prior to us assuming government, we have that space.  

And it's a concern of ours and we are going to be dealing with 

that issue. 

 

To answer specifically your question, it's a mixture of leased 

and a mixture of owned space.  And we work on a daily basis 

to try and utilize as efficiently as we can our space inventory, 

and that process, as you will know, is sort of ongoing. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, when I was questioning you 

some time ago, I mentioned two legal cases.  And I'm not sure 

whether I asked you if SPMC had any more legal cases that are 

ongoing or settled.  Anyway, the question is, is there any more 

than those two, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- To the member from Arm River, 

there are two other cases that are before the courts. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Could you give us those names?  Other 

names were made public; might as well make those public. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- We have one conflict with a 

Laurence Berry, and another problem with a lady by the name 

of Dianne Hoes, H-o-e-s. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Thank you, Mr. Minister.  My last question 

is the paper you sent over with the total minister's executive 

and charter air travel.  Just so I understand this clearly, you've 

got executive and charter.  There's executive and charter in the 

lists here. 



1886 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

 And I just want to be very clear.  Does that include all air 

travel, like out of province, world travel, everything is on here 

or is that just executive air and the charter within the province? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- No, to the member from Arm River.  

It includes executive air and both in province and out that is 

done by exec air and charters which I am assuming are for the 

most part provincial, but I can find out specifically what those 

charter breakdowns are, if you would like. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- Mr. Minister, what you're saying, that 

includes any world travel . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Okay, 

then that leads to another question then.  Would you be able to 

supply us then . . . I thought that's what this would be, but I 

thought you were answering differently, but I looked this paper 

over and I thought it was executive and charter.  Now could 

you give us a breakdown on all travel for all ministers for any 

airline throughout Canada or the world.  Can we have a list of 

that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- We don't book that.  In terms of 

ministerial travel by an international or a national airline, that's 

done by the individual departments.  As an example, I've 

passed my travel across as it relates to my agency of record, the 

Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation.  Other 

ministers will have their line department or their Crown 

corporation where that will be billed to, and they will have that 

information.  We don't have it available for you. 

 

Mr. Muirhead: -- All right, that's fine.  That explains it 

because it just didn't look like it could be enough dollars and 

cents to fly around the world, and fly Air Canada.  But anyway, 

that's the last question I have to ask, and I'd just like to, when 

I'm on my feet, thank the ministers and thank you, Mr. 

Minister, for being very straightforward tonight.  I think some 

of the ministers in the front row should take a lesson from you 

because I think you . . . I'd like to congratulate you on 

answering your questions as straightforward as you did.  Thank 

you, Mr. Minister, and thank you, officials, and Mr. Chairman. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: -- I would like to thank the members 

of the opposition for their questions.  I hope I've been an 

assistance in terms of them performing their duties.  We 

certainly attempt to be as open as we can.  I'd like to as well 

thank my officials for the work not only that they've done this 

evening, but the work that they've put into the preparation for 

these estimates on an ongoing basis.

Women's Secretariat 

Vote 41 

The Chair: -- I will ask the Minister of Health to introduce her 

officials to the committee. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Mr. Chair, I would like to introduce 

Marianne Weston, the executive coordinator for the Women's 

Secretariat.  And immediately behind me, Joan Pederson, the 

assistant executive coordinator of the Women's Secretariat. 

 

Item 1 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Madam Minister, I 

wonder if you would mind outlining to me just briefly what 

you feel the role of the Women's Secretariat is and the job 

they're doing. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  

Well the Women's Secretariat works in partnership with all 

provincial departments in the community in order to achieve 

the goal of equality for Saskatchewan women.  They work to 

integrate women's concerns into the mainstream of all 

government planning and policy making. Government 

programs and services are available to Saskatchewan people 

through line departments such Education, Health, and Social 

Services. 

 

The Women's Secretariat activities then within government 

ensure that women's particular needs and perspectives are 

considered in the development and delivery of these services. 

 

For example, the Women's Secretariat will consult with 

women's groups and organizations throughout the province, as 

well as with individual women, to ensure that the different 

needs are being considered.  They also provide public 

information and education to raise awareness and 

understanding of issues that affect women.  They work towards 

encouraging self-sufficiency for Saskatchewan women, and 

they will coordinate and implement and develop programs and 

activities of the government relating to the status of women.  

They provide a policy development and research support to 

other government departments, and they also engage in 

research to analyse and predict trends with respect to issues that 

impinge on women, and to predict the need with respect to 

future programing, for example. 

 

So they do sort of a role of coordination and integration, policy 

development and research, and they meet extensively with 

groups and organizations within and out of government. 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Thank you, Madam Minister.  Has the agency 

produced any material or conducted any studies in the past 

year?  And if so, would you please provide us with copies of all 

study and material produced by the agency? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Yes, I will undertake to provide that to 

you.  There are two important pieces of paper, the papers that 

have been done.  That's on employment equity and then another 

one again on labour standards discussions.  So there has been 

ongoing work in that area, and I understand there has  



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1887 

been some research and some discussion papers put forward on 

it.  I'll undertake to get you that and anything else that has been 

done by the secretariat. 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Madam Minister, in your own mind, would it be 

more appropriate to spend $1 million on policy coordination 

like you're doing in this department or to spend $1 million on 

keeping a hospital or a school open or reducing the deficit? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Well if you're saying that the Women's 

Secretariat is not important and isn't necessary, I say you're 

dead wrong.  There are issues that pertain to women that need 

the attention of government.  And in Saskatchewan we are 

doing this through a Women's Secretariat, and we are doing it 

by coordinating policy throughout government and making sure 

that government departments consider issues that impact on 

women. 

 

So the answer to your question is, it's absolutely essential that 

we have an agency of government that will make as its primary 

concern issues that impact women and their families and that 

will act as a watchdog on behalf of women and that will move 

society to a goal of equality for women.  So the answer to your 

question is, an agency of this nature is essential. 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Well, Madam Minister, do you think the women 

of the province would agree with your statement in that 

respect?  Or do you think the women of the province would 

prefer to see the million dollars for policy coordination spent in 

another way rather than on a Women's Secretariat? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- The women's organizations throughout 

the province, that speak for women generally, believe that the 

government should be spending more on performing a role of 

moving society towards more equality for women.  So I think 

the answer to your question would be that the spokespeople for 

the women of this province, through women's organizations, 

are urging us to provide a body of this nature and would like to 

see actually more government money being spent on issues of 

that nature. 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- When you say the women's groups of this 

province, I wonder if you could provide me with a list of those 

women's groups of the province that would support your view? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- We can provide you with a list of 

women's groups.  I can also tell you this, that many women's 

groups were asking us to actually have a department that 

pertained to women, and the government, of course, with 

respect to a matter of restraint has chosen not to do that.  We 

feel we can provide the service that they are asking very 

effectively through a women's agency of this nature. 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Madam Minister, I wonder if you could provide 

me with a list of direct services that the agency provides to 

women of this province, just a list of the actual things that they 

can come in to the Women's 

Secretariat and receive? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- I will get the department to put together a 

list, but essentially . . . or the secretariat.  Essentially what the 

secretariat does with respect to direct services is public 

education and public awareness and they will be involved in 

workshops, for example, with respect to sexual harassment in 

the workplace or in other situations. 

 

They also provide an entry for women who are trying to access 

women's services in government and people will phone the 

Women's Secretariat, for example, in order to be directed to 

where they can access this service.  Those are the types of 

direct services that the Women's Secretariat provides.  It also 

provides a very large policy development and research 

component so it is very much a policy development unit within 

government as well. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam 

Minister, could you tell us, does the Women's Secretariat fund 

any third parties or any NGOs (non-governmental 

organizations)? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- No. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Madam Minister, does the Women's 

Secretariat have any involvement with the Women's Institute of 

Saskatchewan? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- It's my understanding that there is 

dialogue and consultations that take place between the 

secretariat and the Women's Institute. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, from what 

you've described of the Women's Secretariat it would be seem 

to be somewhat of an advocacy group to forward the goals and 

aspirations of women.  The Women's Institute has been in place 

in this province since 1911 and for some reason, Madam 

Minister, the Finance minister has decided that this 

organization should no longer receive any government funding. 

 

And the women in the Women's Institute feel that they are 

providing a valuable service within their communities, that the 

support they provide is needed and very worthwhile and yet the 

Minister of Finance, Madam Minister, has decided that that 

objective is not worthy of support within the government.  

Madam Minister, what was your response or did you even 

know that the Minister of Finance was cutting funding to this 

organization? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- The Women's Secretariat in government 

is not simply an advocacy group.  It is a policy and 

development agency.  It is also an agency that provides some 

direct services such as workshops, public awareness education, 

and acting as an entry for women's services.  So it does more 

than simply advocate within government.  It is largely a policy 

development body within government that focuses on how 

programs impact on women and how they can be improved 

with respect to women.  So discontinuance of the grant to the 

Women's Institute is not an reflection on how the government 

views the 



1888 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

contributions that have been made by the Women's Institute.  It 

has provided very fine community work throughout the years. 

 

The discontinuance of the grant relates directly to the 

government's financial situation and is as a result of the deficit 

and the attempt by government to get a handle on the deficit.  

That means that we can no longer continue to fund all of the 

things that have been funded in the past, and this is one area 

that the Minister of Finance felt would not receive a grant any 

longer, but it has nothing to do with the type of work that has 

been done by the Women's Institute. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, my colleague 

was talking of a million dollars for the secretariat, just for the 

policy development area.  What kind of policy development are 

you talking about?  What kind of development are you talking 

about that you're spending this money on, Madam Minister, if 

you feel that the Women's Institute is not an organization 

worthy to continue to receive government funding? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Well first of all there's a lot of policy that 

is developed by government as we move through programs and 

services in government; there's a lot.  If you look at health and 

how health impacts on women, look at education and how that 

impacts on women, these are the kinds of things that the 

Women's Secretariat does. 

 

And I'm surprised that you're not aware of that because your 

government, as you know, had a Women's Secretariat for years, 

the whole time that you were in office, and presumably 

provided much of the same functions.  This isn't something 

new.  So the Women's Secretariat was there before we took 

office.  You had a Women's Secretariat that did policy 

development. 

 

(2115) 

 

What sort of policy development does the Women's Secretariat 

do?  Well some of the very extensive research issues that have 

been undertaken this year are things such as the whole issue of 

pay equity.  We have two human rights cases right now that 

have been launched with respect to that issue and the business 

community is asking us to look at it, and the Women's 

Secretariat is looking at that issue.  Workers with family 

responsibilities is another policy area that needs clarification.  

Women and labour standards legislation is another area that 

needs research.  Employment equity, career development, 

women in non-traditional occupations -- these are some of the 

areas that the Women's Secretariat are taking a look at, 

researching, and providing government with recommendations. 

 

The violence against women and the need to try and get a 

handle on that issue is another very extensive area that the 

Women's Secretariat is involved in and has developed 

numerous workshops on sexual harassment, for example, and 

they're working on the partnerships committee on family 

violence.  There's 

very extensive work of that nature being done on an ongoing 

basis by the Women's Secretariat. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, some of those 

goals are very laudable, but it seems that some other goals that 

women may have do not seem worthy of your consideration or 

the consideration of your government. 

 

Education is one of those things that the Women's Institute was 

involved in, and health was one of those things which you said 

is part of the policy development area of the Women's 

Secretariat, yet you felt that the Women's Institute was not 

worthy of funding.  Perhaps, Madam Minister, it's simply a 

situation of politics. 

 

Your party has a political vein which it wishes to head in and 

which was not the direction the Women's Institute was going 

in.  They were not advocating pay equity, which is one of the 

items you suggested you're doing research in. 

 

Madam Minister, which areas of policy have seen a growth in 

funding and which areas have seen a cut in funding? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- First of all, I had told the member 

opposite already -- but I know that it is their bent on the other 

side of the House to make allegations that are clearly not 

accurate and to continue to say it over and over again in the 

hope that someone will believe what they say -- I indicated to 

you that the reason the funding had been cut off for the 

Women's Institute had to do with the fact we have a $15 billion 

debt and an ongoing deficit in this province and we can't 

continue to fund everything we would like to or that we funded 

before, and had nothing to do with the worthiness of the 

Women's Institute.  And I'm saying it again, for the third time, I 

believe, this evening. 

 

You may think it has to do with their worthiness; I'm saying it 

does not have to do with their worthiness.  It is a deficit 

situation that is considered here.  So I want to correct that 

statement once again. 

 

There are many women's organizations throughout the province 

that do work on these issues, and the Women's Secretariat 

provides sort of a central resource.  There's a library, for 

example, that can be accessed by some of the other 

organizations that choose to do research  -- and there's lots of 

them in the province, of women who are interested.  They may 

represent one aspect like the pay equity aspect or the violence 

aspect for example.  And I pointed out to you as well in my 

comments earlier with respect to pay equity that there were two 

complaints at the Human Rights Commission about pay 

inequity.  So I think it's important that as a government we 

examine that issue. 

 

Now you can smirk at that.  I'm sure you don't believe in pay 

equity or that women should be earning wages of equal value 

for work of equal value.  I'm sure that's your position because I 

know that's the Tory position.  That women should be paid less 

then men to do the same work, I know that's the Tory position, 

and that's 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1889 

 why he's smirking. 

 

I think it's important that we take a look at this issue to 

determine what the extent of the wage gap is in the province.  

And although we cannot afford to implement a full-fledged pay 

equity program, there may be things we can do to lessen the 

impact, that don't cost substantial amounts of money.  And I 

think we have an obligation as a government to look into those 

things, and that's one of the areas that the Women's Secretariat 

is taking a look at and will continue to take a look at. 

 

And of course, there's some urgency on our part to look at it 

because the business community is saying there are these 

complaints before the Human Rights Commission, and you 

should determine how you're going to deal with this particular 

issue.  So we are taking a look at it from both points of view in 

that regard. 

 

But you know, to suggest that because there are other bodies in 

society that do research in a particular area or have interests in 

a particular area, that governments should not have its policy 

developmental branch, it doesn't work that way.  There are all 

sorts of bodies outside of government that have special interests 

that do their research and then present them to government.  

That doesn't mean that government abdicates its responsibility 

to develop policy in those areas. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, you did a very 

good job of avoiding the question, and that was how many . . . 

which policy areas received increases in funding and which 

policy areas did receive cut-backs? 

 

Madam Minister, you don't know what my position is on pay 

equity, and I'll tell you what it is.  It's equal work for equal pay 

which is exactly the opposite to what you said it was.  So, 

Madam Minister, you don't know what you're talking about on 

that particular issue. 

 

You said that there was two pay equity complaints before the 

Human Rights Commission.  Madam Minister, that's two out of 

how many complaints before the Human Rights Commission.  

Now will you answer the question of which policy areas 

received increases and which ones received decreases in 

funding? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- You will have to clarify that question.  I 

don't know what you mean.  Which policies received more 

monies?  What do you mean?  What . . . like, can you be more 

specific because I'm not sure what you mean by that question. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, you said you 

have policies that you develop within the Women's Secretariat.  

So you must have a list of what areas of policy you're 

investigating or which you're studying.  So what are those areas 

that received increases in fundings and which areas received 

decreases? 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Well first of all, I did give you a list of 

things that were being reviewed.  We don't fund; we don't fund 

these various areas.  Now I can say this, that with respect to 

family violence there was some increased funding in last year's 

budget in the Health department, and there may have been in 

some other areas.  But the Women's Secretariat doesn't fund 

programs.  It develops policy, and other government 

departments will then fund the programs if they decide to 

proceed with them. 

 

And in many cases it doesn't even mean an increase in funding; 

it means a change in direction.  So it doesn't necessarily amount 

to funding for a particular thing.  But I can get you information 

. . . if what the member wants is some information on 

additional funding for women's services within government, I 

can get a list of that put together, if indeed we have it.  We may 

even have it here now. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, there's a million 

dollars or so for policy development.  What do you do with that 

money?  Do you simply give it to the Women's Secretariat and 

say, here's a million dollars; spend it some place?  Or do they 

provide you a list of things that that money will be spent on?  If 

they provide you a list of things that the money will be spent 

on, which of those items have gone up and which have gone 

down? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Okay, the budget is 768,000, if this is 

your question.  You're asking, how is the 768,000 . . . It's not a 

million, it's three-quarters of a million, a little bit more.  Five 

hundred and seven thousand is spent on personal services; 

that's researchers and people who work within the Women's 

Secretariat.  The other expenses are 166,000 and there is 

95,000, I believe, to the Saskatchewan Property Management 

Corporation.  This totals 768,000. 

 

So what is not happening is that funding is being taken and 

applied to a particular project or program, if that's what you're 

saying.  There is a general research analyst component in the 

Women's Secretariat which was there when you were in 

government, and the personal services come to 507,000. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, as another 

correction I was not in government.  The research analysts that 

you have in place there, Madam Minister, what are they 

researching?  Are they researching certain policies, or do you 

just give them a set . . . a lump of money and they go off and do 

whatever they want to? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- I indicated to you earlier that they are 

researching policies. I gave you a list of some of the things that 

were being researched.  If you want a more detailed, 

comprehensive list I can undertake to provide you with that. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, that's what I was 

asking about four questions ago, was that list and what funding 

was going up and down for each 



1890 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

one of those areas. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- The member opposite in his very 

condescending fashion doesn't seem to understand that when 

you have a department with employees in it, you're not 

contracting with them on a contractual basis, saying X number 

of dollars for this.  You pay them a salary, and you tell them 

you want these items taken care of and this research done.  

They are paid salaries. They are not paid by contract. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Madam Minister, it seems to be 

very difficult for you to give me those items and those research 

matters that they're doing.  That's what I'm asking for and 

whether there is more funding being spent in one particular 

item area, or less money being spent in that particular item area 

than there was previously done. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- I've told you the priorities are family 

violence, wage gap, workers with family responsibilities, 

income security with respect to women.  Those are the 

priorities.  They will also do other things. 

 

Now as to how much money is spent on that, you don't . . . 

(inaudible) . . . you pay a salary and you get a job done.  You 

don't say, okay you're only supposed to spend 10,000 of your 

$30,000 salary doing this.  These people are on salary and they 

do their work and their research.  You don't break it down in 

terms of how much money is being spent on a particular issue. 

 

Now if you want us to sit there and take every hour down and 

how much time they spend researching this and counting up all 

the hours for that place, maybe we could come to a formula that 

would tell you, they spent X number of hours on this particular 

area and that's how much money then is allotted to it.  It's not 

the way it's done.  They're paid a salary.  They're given their 

duties and responsibilities and they fulfil them. 

 

I don't understand why the member can't understand how that 

operates.  That's how you do a policy and development.  You 

don't break it down into terms of dollars and cents on this issue 

and dollars and cents on that issue.  You hire people.  They're 

on salary and then they do the research. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- So basically, Madam Minister, then you 

just give them a lump sum of money for a year's salary and say, 

here's some areas that we'd like you to do some research in and 

they go out and spend whatever amount of time they feel like 

spending on those particular areas.  Is that what happens? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Well what happens is this.  The 

government establishes priorities with respect to policy 

development.  They want to know how a certain issue will 

impact.  The employee then goes out, does the research and 

provides the government with some recommendations and 

findings.  And this information will be provided to other 

departments as well so that further policy development and 

issues, the handling of issues, can take place in an adequate 

fashion. 

(2130) 

 

So what happens is people are paid a salary, they are instructed 

to do certain kinds of work -- and I told you what the priorities 

were -- they go out and they do that work and they provide 

government with recommendations.  From that, government 

determines whether or not they're going to implement the 

recommendations or how they're going to implement them and 

so on.  So that's how it works with respect to a policy 

development unit.  You pay a salary.  You ask for a job to be 

done and you move on to the next job. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Okay, Madam Minister, you say you've 

given me a list of priorities.  Will you give me a list of your 

secretariat's policy priorities, numbering them the most 

important at one and going on down the list?  And what 

impacts your research has come up with in those areas. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- We can certainly do that for you, give 

you a list of the work that . . . the ongoing work that is being 

done by the secretariat and any other information we have with 

respect to exactly what is being achieved by the Women's 

Secretariat.  We can certainly do that. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Will you place that list in the priority of 

the government? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Well yes, we can do that.  We can itemize 

our priorities. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Madam Minister. 

 

Now I'd like to go to another issue which we discussed last year 

in the Women's Secretariat and that was the situation of 

maintenance.  What has changed, Madam Minister, if anything 

in that area, for the women and children of this province? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- I'm advised that there has been increased 

funding in 1993-94 to improve enforcement powers and to 

enable the program to continue to successfully service 

Saskatchewan families. 

 

The maintenance enforcement office apparently has received 

13,902 cases from 1986 to March 1993 which I think is quite 

important.  As of March 31, 1993, there's been nearly $50 

million processed which I think is also important for the public 

to know.  So there has been some increased funding to improve 

the enforcement powers in this year's budget and there has 

been, since 1986 to 1993, nearly $50 million processed.  Now 

we can still do better and the government will do what it can to 

improve on that situation, but it definitely is a move in the right 

direction. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Madam Minister.  I know 

that it's a great problem out there for quite a number of people. 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1891 

One of the problems that is brought forward to me is the 

garnishee situation, where a person's wages are garnisheed.  

They move from that point onwards, but it seems to take quite a 

while before, in most cases, a woman receives that money.  

And it seems to be quite a time period in there where it's lost in 

the shuffle, where the man has had the money garnisheed 

before the woman gets it.  Is your Women's Secretariat looking 

into that at all, Madam Minister? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Well they will look into it.  If that's a 

problem, we will check with the Justice department to 

determine why the delay.  So thank you for bringing it to our 

attention. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- One other issue, Madam Minister, is, and 

this may not necessarily pertain to the Women's Secretariat -- 

I'm not sure -- but it's access to children. 

 

Some parents do not have an easy access to their child, and it 

seems to be a situation where the one spouse for whatever 

reason wishes to deny access.  And it may be a situation where 

maintenance has not been paid, and I can understand some of 

the emotional involvement in that kind of a situation.  But in 

other cases, it's not that that's the problem; it's some other issue.  

Have you looked at the situation of access to children, Madam 

Minister? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- No.  The Women's Secretariat would not 

have looked at that.  That is really an issue for the courts.  That 

if a . . . And there's very little else that can be done about that.  

Like, I can't see how governments could legislate access to 

children.  Because what has to take place in a situation like 

that, if a parent is being denied access, they then would have to 

take an application to court or go to a mediator and have the 

matter settled in a manner such as that, either through 

arbitration between their lawyers, through a mediator, or 

through the courts. 

 

Now I know the hardship that that causes for people, but I don't 

see any way that government can intervene and start legislating 

access.  This is something that's going to have to be worked out 

within families and through the legal system and any other 

services, counselling services that might be available for 

people. 

 

So the Women's Secretariat, no, would not have a mandate to 

review that particular issue, but . . . unless the member opposite 

has some ideas of his own as to what government could do in 

that regard, I'd be willing to hear them.  But my instinctive 

reaction is that this is something that would have to be settled 

through the legal process.  And I'm not saying that because I'm 

not aware of the hardship it creates and the turmoil within 

families when that situation arises, because I understand that 

problem.  But if you have some suggestions, I'd like to hear 

them. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Madam Minister.  Yes it is a 

problem and perhaps one of the things that needs to be put in 

place is some sort of an intermediary system that parents, either 

parent could 

apply to for some recourse, such as what was suggested in the 

Environment Committee's report for people who had concerns 

with the environment.  Some sort of an intermediary step 

before you actually were forced to go into the court and the 

expenses involved there. 

 

On a situation of maintenance again, Madam Minister, where a 

person moves out of the province or moves continuously, we 

talked about this last year.  We talked with the Minister of 

Justice about it.  Has anything been done there to try and speed 

up the tracking systems to follow a person as they move, 

Madam Minister? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- This requires the cooperation of other 

provinces if we're going to speed up that process. And it's my 

understanding that there have been ongoing discussions with 

other provinces about what can be done.  But it's also my 

understanding that there's been no resolution with respect to 

that problem at this time.  So it is something we're aware, 

something we're working towards, but it's not something we 

can solve unilaterally.  We need the cooperation of other 

players. 

 

And it does get very difficult when people move because you 

may catch up to them in one place, and then they're gone to 

another location and another province.  So we are very much 

aware of that.  And if there's something that we can do 

interprovincially to deal with that, you know, we would like to 

know.  To date, the discussions haven't resolved that problem.

Item 1 



1892 Saskatchewan Hansard May 20, 1993 

Mr. Britton: -- Madam Minister, I would like to visit with you 

a little bit tonight on some of the housekeeping questions, 

firstly, if it's all right with you. 

 

I was looking through the Health estimates on a line-by-line 

basis and can't help but notice that the increase of funding is in 

your administration and your human resources and 

communications branch.  Why is it, Madam Minister, that 

Saskatchewan residents endure cut-back after cut-back and 

health care professionals and other staff must endure massive 

lay-offs while your own department flourishes.  Could you 

explain that a little bit to us, please. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Okay, I'm told that communication is not 

up, that the cost in administration is up as a result of the 

associate minister's office. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Well, Madam Minister, the only branch of the 

Health department to receive an increase was administration.  I 

don't think that's acceptable, Madam Minister. 

 

I note that the salaries increased substantially.  Is this increase 

due to higher numbers in this area or is it just higher wages 

paid to the same people, or less? 

 

(2145) 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- There are additional staff members as a 

result of an Associate Minister of Health.  The member 

opposite knows that we're launched on a major health reform in 

the province, very massive health reform that's involving a lot 

of areas.  In order to do this, of course, we need people who can 

get the job done. 

 

Now with respect to salary increases, I want to point out that 

the deputy minister of Health under the former government 

made substantially more than the deputy minister of Health 

under this government, for example. 

 

The increase in administration, as I indicated, is because of 

additional staff associated with the associate minister's office. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Well thank you, Madam Minister.  The 

previous associate minister was probably worth more money. 

 

Madam Minister, how many new people? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- I'm told that the net increase is 3.5.  

There's six people employed in the associate minister's office, 

but there's been a decrease in administration in the Department 

of Health itself.  So there's a net increase of 3.5.  I should also 

point out that under the former government, as you know, your 

government as well had an associate minister.  We did not have 

an associate minister in the first several months of government 

until we were well launched into the health reform. 

Mr. Britton: -- Madam Minister, did we have one in the first 

few months of our government? 

 

Madam Minister, I notice that the operating expenses increased 

as well.  Could you tell us why the increase, Madam Minister, 

in the operating expenses? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- The member opposite should know that 

the increase in operating expenses is largely due to the fact that 

the plastic health card that was initiated by your government 

has to be reissued because there's an expiry date.  As a result of 

the policy developed by your government you have a plastic 

health card with an expiry date.  That comes due this fall, in 

December, and has to be reissued and that's largely the result of 

the increase. 

 

Now we are not going to reissue the card I'm told by the 

department.  We are going to put out stickers in order to try and 

keep the cost down, rather than reissuing the card as you had 

originally anticipated would be done. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Well thank you, Madam Minister.  I appreciate 

the thought but I kind of wonder, because the card is plastic -- 

and I think even your side of the House would agree that it was 

a good idea -- but plastic does wear out.  And I wonder if 

you're going to be able to make that work with a sticker.  I hope 

you can because of the cost, but I doubt it.  Could you explain . 

. . you said you had 3.5 people.  Does that mean you have a 

part-time person or how do you split that person up? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Yes, that's a part-time person.  And with 

respect to the plastic card, to reissue them would cost, I'm told, 

almost three times what it would cost to put a sticker, or to deal 

with a sticker.  And we've tried to go the less expensive route 

and see . . . I believe it will work, but there may be some 

problems associated with it.  I know what the member's 

referring to. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Well as I said before, Madam Minister, I 

appreciate what you're doing, and I'm not so sure it'll work 

because the plastic card that I have usually splits, but fair 

enough, fair enough. 

 

Madam Minister, could you tell me what the total amount the 

Department of Health paid in communications.  What is your 

communications budget? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- The total budget is 1.982 million, which 

is down from 2.056 million from last year.  And this is for 

everything including nonpromotional printing and duplicating. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Madam Minister. Am I correct in 

assuming that the total you provided as the communication 

budget includes all advertising cost?  And if it's yes, would you 

provide the total amount on health and reform, wellness 

communications? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Yes I understand it is . . . yes, that is all 

inclusive and we don't have figures for this year 



May 20, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1893 

because we haven't spent the money this year, but last year 

there was $291,953 spent in developing information for the 

health community about the wellness approach and health 

system reform.  So the 1.982 million is all inclusive. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Madam Minister, I appreciate that.  

I'm curious about another thing.  It's something I saw on the 

Saskatoon Health Board's recent news release and it's regarding 

the lay-offs in the city hospitals.  In that release I noted that 

they have both a communications coordinator and a 

communications officer.  Now how many other communication 

professionals are employed with the Saskatoon Health Board?  

Could you tell us how many?  Could you tell us what they are 

paid?  And is it necessary, Madam Minister, to have two 

communication people for one board?  And the other thing, 

while you're there, could you tell us, are these people paid 

strictly from the Health Board, or are they hospital employees? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- The member opposite should know that 

with respect to the amalgamation of hospitals in Saskatoon that 

all of the employees of the former boards are now employees of 

the Saskatoon Health Board, and we don't have the salary range 

of all these employees.  We don't know what every employee 

makes on the Saskatoon Health Board. 

 

In the past, every hospital had its own communication 

department.  Now what has happened under one board . . . that 

this has all been amalgamated under one board, and we don't 

know how many employees they used to have as opposed to 

how many employees they have now.  I don't have that 

information or the details of that information. 

 

But in the past, it was three separate communication 

departments.  Now it would be one communications 

department, and all of these people would be employees of the 

Saskatoon Health Board. 

 

I was just handed something here from the Department of 

Health with respect to the Saskatoon Health Board that seems 

to indicate that they have only two employees with respect to 

communications, but I'm not sure that that is the final answer.  I 

would want to check that; I would want to double-check.  But 

this chart, this organizational chart seems to indicate that.  But I 

would want to double-check it with them. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Madam Minister.  We may have to 

come back to this a little later.  I was just trying to clean up 

some more or less housekeeping kind of questions with you.  

But I would like to find out a little more about that later. 

 

Madam Minister, could you tell us then who was on the 

Saskatoon Health Board payroll?  Please provide us the names 

of those individuals and include the positions they fill.  And 

would you please inform the Assembly if these positions are 

full time or part time.  Are they voluntary or paid positions?  If 

they are paid, please detail the total cost of the positions, 

including salaries and expenses.  I'm trying to lump these 

questions, Madam Minister, in the essence of time. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- A point of clarification.  Are you asking 

about the board members or are you asking about the staff?  

Because if you're asking about the staff, we're talking 

thousands of employees.  You're asking about the board 

members?  Okay, I'll get you that information. 

 

Okay the names of the members are Cliff Wright and he's a 

very well-known person to all of you; Darlene Bessey, who 

was an executive director of the YWCA of Saskatoon since 

May 1989; Susan Wagner, who is a nurse and associate 

professor with the University of Saskatchewan's College of 

Nursing; Mr. Brian Rourke, who is a lawyer; Mr. Brian 

Morgan who is the director of personnel services with the City 

of Saskatoon, and Ms. Dorothy Fortier who is the 

vice-president of the Saskatchewan School Trustees 

Association. 

 

I have their resumes here, their biographies which I'll send over 

to you and we've already provided you with information about 

the per diems that these people receive and the money that is 

paid to them.  That information was provided a couple of 

weeks ago but we can get it together again for you if you want 

us to. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Well thank you, Madam Minister . . . 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- If there's some comments you want to 

make, I was just going to report progress.  If the member from 

Wilkie wants to make some comments, he can do so. 

 

Mr. Britton: -- I guess we can revisit this at the next session. 

 

The committee reported progress. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 10:01 p.m.
