Mr. Speaker, could I ask that you entertain an amendment from my colleague for Rosthern? 
 
MR. SPEAKER: — I will ask the guidance of the Assembly here because I realize I have gone two 
ways on this. I cannot accept this motion because it is not in order. I did once before and allowed it to be 
changed to municipal affairs rather than urban affairs. I would admit, at this point, that I was out of order 
before in accepting it when it was not in order. 
 
I will ask the members of the Assembly if they want to allow this slight change to be made in the motion 
that is before us? 
 
SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Agreed. 
 
MR. SPEAKER: — I will change it to municipal affairs. I will accept the amendment. 
 
MR. KATZMAN: — I move, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Berntson), that the word 
“municipal” replace the word “rural’ in the second line.

Speaker in the future.
