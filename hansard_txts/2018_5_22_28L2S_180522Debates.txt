 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 4343 
 May 22, 2018 
 
[The Assembly met at 13:30.] 
 
[Prayers] 
 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure today to introduce to you and through you to all the 
members of the Assembly a group of 36 students from the 
Cupar School. They are students from the grade 8, 9, and 12 
classes. They are seated in the west gallery, Mr. Speaker. I 
wonder if the Cupar students could give us a wave because I 
believe there’s another school group in the west gallery. There 
they are. 
 
Today, Mr. Speaker, they are accompanied by their principal, 
Mr. Bruce; their teacher, Mr. Trakalo; educational assistant, Ms. 
Dinsmore. They’ve already had the tour of the building. We had 
a very short meeting and the photograph on the grand staircase. 
There was some extra photographers that made sure we had a 
good picture, including the Minister of Social Services here. 
And I would ask all members to welcome the Cupar students to 
their Assembly. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Bonk: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and through 
you to all members of the Assembly, I’d like to introduce 17 
grade 6 students from Rocanville. They’re here today with their 
teachers, Mr. Jensen and Ms. Nadine Lowe, and educational 
assistant Debbie Logan, and probably the most patient of all, 
their bus driver, James Calloway. I look forward to meeting 
them after question period today and have some questions from 
them. I’m sure they’ll have some good questions for me. So I’d 
like all members to welcome them to their Assembly. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Prince Albert 
Carlton. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hargrave: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
to you and through you I’d like to introduce a new constituent 
of mine, Mr. Sorabh Sood. He’s seated up in your gallery. 
Thanks for the wave. In February of 2018, Mr. Sood and his 
wife arrived in Saskatchewan from Dubai, and is currently 
working for the Prince Albert branch of the Royal Bank of 
Canada as a financial adviser. 
 
Mr. Sood was born into a Hindu family in the province of 
Punjab, India. Prior to moving to Prince Albert, Mr. Sood 
worked for 11 years as a financial adviser in Dubai. His 
previous work has taken him around the globe, including 
Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. We’re very pleased to have 
him and his wife as new citizens of this province and of Prince 
Albert. Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker, is now home to over 1.170 
million people, and that’s a record high for our province. A 
good portion of this growth is from newcomers like the Soods 
who come to Canada and choose to call Saskatchewan home. 

Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me to welcome Mr. Sood 
to his Legislative Assembly. 
 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Francis: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to rise 
today to present a petition from citizens who are opposed to the 
federal government’s decision to impose a carbon tax on the 
province of Saskatchewan. 
 
I’d like to read the prayer: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully request 
the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan take the 
following action: to cause the Government of 
Saskatchewan to take the necessary steps to stop the 
federal government from imposing a carbon tax on the 
province. 

 
Mr. Speaker, this petition is signed by citizens of Kindersley. I 
do so present. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Thanks, Mr. Speaker. I rise to present 
petitions on behalf of concerned citizens with the Sask Party 
government’s elimination of the Saskatchewan rental housing 
supplement. This really hurts those living on the tightest of 
budgets, on the margins, people living with disabilities, families 
with low wages with children, Mr. Speaker. Certainly they’re 
calling for the reversal of this callous decision. 
 
And the prayer reads as follows: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully request 
that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan call on the 
Sask Party government to immediately restore the 
Saskatchewan rental housing supplement. 

 
And these petitions are signed by concerned residents from 
Regina. I so submit. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise 
today to present a petition to get big money out of 
Saskatchewan politics. And the undersigned residents of the 
province of Saskatchewan want to bring to our attention the 
following: that Saskatchewan’s outdated election Act allows 
corporations, unions, and individuals, even those outside the 
province, to make unlimited donations to our province’s 
political parties. 
 
And we know that the people of Saskatchewan deserve to live 
in a fair province where all voices are equal and money can’t 
influence politics. And we know the Sask Party leader Brad 
Wall was the only premier in the country who collected a 
special cash bonus, a top-up paid for by taxpayer-funded 
subsidies and a portion of the millions in donations they collect 
from corporations and big-money donors, including many from 



4344 Saskatchewan Hansard May 22, 2018 

outside the province. 
 
We know, for example, Mr. Speaker, that over the past 10 
years, the Sask Party has received $12.61 million in corporate 
donations and of that, 2.87 million came from companies 
outside of Saskatchewan; and that the federal government, the 
provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and now 
British Columbia have moved to limit this influence and level 
the playing field by banning corporate and union donations to 
political parties. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to read the prayer: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully request 
that the Government of Saskatchewan call on the Sask 
Party to overhaul Saskatchewan’s campaign finance laws, 
to end out-of-province donations, to put a ban on donations 
from corporations and unions, and to put a donation limit 
on individual donations. 

 
Mr. Speaker, the people signing this petition today come from 
the city of Saskatoon, North Battleford, Melfort, and Regina. I 
do so present. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 
Park. 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to 
present a petition calling for critical workplace supports for 
survivors of domestic violence. Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan has 
the very dubious distinction of having the highest rates of 
intimate partner violence in Canada, amongst all of the 
provinces. And we know we must do so much more to protect 
survivors of domestic violence. 
 
For those who experience domestic violence, often the violence 
will follow them to their workplace, which is why the 
signatories to this petition are calling for five days of paid leave 
and up to 17 weeks of unpaid leave be made available to 
workers who are survivors of domestic violence, and that 
critical workplace supports made available to survivors of 
domestic violence be also made available to workers living with 
PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] as a result of that 
domestic violence. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is what those who are on the front lines of this 
crisis, those who are working in transition houses throughout 
the province are calling for, including PATHS [Provincial 
Association of Transition Houses and Services of 
Saskatchewan] and the YWCA [Young Women’s Christian 
Organization] as two prominent organizations. 
 
They see the importance of ensuring that survivors of domestic 
violence are able to maintain their employment through their 
transition away from an unstable home to a more stable living 
environment, Mr. Speaker. This is what we’re calling for in Bill 
No. 609, the fourth time we’ve put forward this provision in 
two years. It’s time for the government to step up, do the right 
thing, and pass those provisions. 
 
I’d like to read the prayer: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully request 

that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan call upon 
the Sask Party to pass legislation to ensure critical supports 
in the workplace, including reasonable accommodation and 
paid and unpaid leave to survivors of domestic violence. 

 
Mr. Speaker, the individuals signing this petition today come 
from Regina. I do so present. 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 

International Day for Biological Diversity 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is the 25th 
anniversary of the International Day for Biological Diversity. 
Around the world we celebrate the rich variety of life on earth 
that is essential for the welfare and prosperity of people today 
and for generations to come. Mr. Speaker, protecting and 
restoring ecosystems and reducing deforestation, land 
degradation, and enhancing carbon stocks and forests, wetlands, 
rangelands, and croplands are needed for mitigating climate 
change. 
 
Mr. Speaker, today is also the first day of a week-long 
celebration in my hometown of Saskatoon: NatureCity Festival, 
put on by Wild About Saskatoon. Their goal is to foster a fresh, 
everyday connection between urban residents and the nature 
that envelops us. We want to nurture a civic culture where a 
respect for the living world is routinely reflected in our 
collective and individual decisions. 
 
Mr. Speaker, a city is just not built, it’s also planted. Saskatoon 
provides habitat not only for humans but also for hundreds, 
maybe even thousands of species of plants, insects, birds, 
animals from bumblebees to bass, from ducks to otters, and 
even the odd moose. Mr. Speaker, nature does not begin where 
the sidewalk ends. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join together as we mark this 
very special day as we endeavour to act to protect the nature 
that sustains us. Our collective future depends on it. Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Westview. 
 

Brewery Expands Into United States 
 
Mr. Buckingham: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
I’m proud to rise today in this Assembly to acknowledge the 
success of Great Western brewery in Saskatoon. The company 
announced today that they are expanding their premium 
product, Original 16, into the US [United States]. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there has been steady growth of the craft and 
import segment of the beer market in the United States, and the 
demand for quality products in premium and craft beer from 
Saskatchewan has been rising. Original 16 will look to take 
advantage of these trends and offer their diverse and delicious 
product to consumers right across the US. Mr. Speaker, this 
expansion will be executed in multiple phases with the first 
focus on the southwestern states. The company will partner 



May 22, 2018 Saskatchewan Hansard 4345 

with No Limit Brands and Import Services and leverage great 
relationships, as well as a highly regarded brand to appeal to US 
consumers. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the craft alcohol industry continues to grow as 
more and more consumers recognize the quality of locally made 
Saskatchewan wine, spirit, and beer products. That growth will 
continue to help create jobs, grow tourism, and lead to other 
economic spinoffs right here at home. 
 
On behalf of this entire Assembly, I would like to congratulate 
Great Western brewery on their expansion into the US and wish 
them all the best in this endeavour. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 
Park. 
 

Lady Justice Dinner and Fundraiser 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, on May 17th the Elizabeth Fry 
Society of Saskatchewan hosted the Lady Justice Dinner and 
fundraiser. This dinner is held every year to recognize women 
who are making a difference in their community. 
 
The Elizabeth Fry Society of Saskatchewan is a woman-centred 
non-profit organization committed to working with women 
before, during, and after incarceration. It is the only 
organization in the province of Saskatchewan working 
specifically with adult women and their families involved with 
the criminal justice system. 
 
Programs and services offered by the Elizabeth Fry Society 
encourage an end to recidivism and support crime prevention 
through a social developmental approach. They are a 
community-based voice for women at risk, as well as those who 
are criminalized as a result of poverty, racism, histories of 
abuse, or a lack of education. The event featured a garden-side 
chat with Senators Kim Pate, Lillian Dyck, and Mary Jane 
McCallum who shared their insights on women’s 
empowerment. 
 
Mr. Speaker, each year Lady Justice Awards are presented to 
women who are making a difference in their community. The 
event aims to both recognize women’s leadership in their 
communities and enhance public awareness and education 
regarding the circumstances of victimized and criminalized 
women in the criminal justice system. 
 
I would ask the Assembly to join me in congratulating the 
Elizabeth Fry Society for putting on yet another successful 
dinner. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rochdale. 
 

Women Entrepreneurs Week 
 
Ms. Ross: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the week 
of May 20th to 26th has been proclaimed as Women 
Entrepreneurs Week in Saskatchewan. This week recognizes the 
success of women entrepreneurs across the province and 
celebrates their contribution to our communities and to the 
economy. Saskatchewan women entrepreneurs contribute to the 
economy in many sectors, such as construction, manufacturing, 

health science, finance, and technology. 
 
Mr. Speaker, another announcement this month is the 
investment in indigenous economic development in 
Saskatchewan by the organization Women Entrepreneurs of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
[13:45] 
 
Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan CEO [chief executive 
officer] Prabha Mitchell highlighted investments of more than 
300,000 for Indigenous Women Entrepreneurs Program in 
Saskatchewan, through Western Economic Diversification 
Canada and other funding sources. The Indigenous Women 
Entrepreneurs Program was initiated by Women Entrepreneurs 
of Saskatchewan in the capacity . . . about the indigenous 
women, and to serve as a catalyst for economic growth in 
indigenous communities. Investing in the capacity of 
indigenous women to become successful entrepreneurs will 
help build a stronger and more inclusive economy in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to congratulate the Women Entrepreneurs 
of Saskatchewan, as well as the Indigenous Women 
Entrepreneurs Program, on this very significant investment. I 
would like to ask all members to join me in celebrating Women 
Entrepreneurs Week across the province. When women 
succeed, Mr. Speaker, we all succeed. Thank you very much, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cut 
Knife-Turtleford. 
 

Cut Knife Resident Wins Global Citizen Award 
 
Mr. Doke: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, each year 
the Saskatchewan Council for International Co-operation 
celebrates International Development Week. This year it was 
celebrated in early February in Saskatoon, with the theme 
Partners for a Better World. 
 
As part of their celebrations, SCIC [Saskatchewan Council for 
International Co-operation] presented a small number of Global 
Citizen Awards to Saskatchewan residents who have shown 
their commitment to being a global citizen. Two people were 
celebrated in Saskatoon, one being Marcella Pedersen of Cut 
Knife.  
 
Marcella has had a long dedication to ecological, human rights, 
and food sovereignty advocacy through the church. Since 1974 
she has been involved in the Canadian Catholic Organization 
for Development and Peace. This is one of the largest 
non-governmental organizations of the world and is part of an 
international confederation of 162 Catholic relief, development, 
and social services organizations working on behalf of the poor 
and oppressed across the globe. 
 
In addition, Mr. Speaker, Marcella has also been active in other 
organizations within international reach, serving on the 
provincial boards for both the Catholic Women’s League and 
the National Farmers Union. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone in this Assembly to join me in 



4346 Saskatchewan Hansard May 22, 2018 

congratulating Marcella on the Global Citizen Award and 
thanking her for all her selfless work and dedication to people 
everywhere. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Churchill-Wildwood. 
 

New Community Health Clinic to Open in Saskatoon 
 
Ms. Lambert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A new community 
health centre is set to open this fall at Market Mall in Saskatoon 
with a focus on people aged 50 and over. Mr. Speaker, this 
clinic is being established as part of our connected care strategy, 
a collaborative, team-based approach that ensures patients 
receive the care they need when and where they need it. It will 
provide care closer to home outside of the traditional hospital 
setting. Mr. Speaker, the clinic plans to staff numerous 
professionals, including physicians, nurse practitioners, 
paramedics, social workers, occupational and physical 
therapists. 
 
On behalf of Strathallen Capital Corp., Taylor Brown has stated 
that their vision “. . . continues to be transforming Market Mall 
into a community hub of sorts, offering an array of alternative 
services to the Saskatoon community.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Saskatoon and the Market Mall area 
will be well served by this clinic, and so will our health care 
system as a whole. My constituency has the highest number of 
seniors per capita in the province, and thousands of seniors 
reside in the two-mile radius around Market Mall. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I now ask that all members please join me in 
recognizing the new community health clinic set to open this 
fall in Saskatoon and wish the new staff all the best in its 
opening and future operations. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatchewan 
Rivers. 
 

Saskatchewan Association of Architects’ Conference 
 
Hon. Ms. Wilson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was so pleased 
to attend the Saskatchewan Association of Architects’ annual 
general meeting and conference earlier this month. The meeting 
was held at Elk Ridge Resort in the beautiful boreal forest in 
my constituency of Saskatchewan Rivers.  
 
The Saskatchewan Association of Architects is a regulatory 
body which exists to ensure proficiency and competency of its 
members and to promote and increase knowledge related to the 
practice of architecture in Saskatchewan. 
 
This year’s SAA [Saskatchewan Association of Architects] 
conference explored how mid-sized cities offer a platform for 
interesting, unusual, or specific models of architectural practice. 
Questions for discussion from the conference included how is 
local architecture made; how is a community being built; how 
do we make our mid-sized cities; and who benefits from this 
work, and what does it inspire. The conference featured an array 
of speakers and presenters from across North America, all in an 
effort to find better practices for designing mid-sized cities. 
 

Mr. Speaker, as a province consisting entirely of mid-sized 
cities and smaller, I have no doubt Saskatchewan architects 
learned something intriguing and had much to contribute to 
these discussions. I ask that all members of the Assembly join 
me in thanking the AGM [annual general meeting] organizers 
and all attending architects for their work in our province. 
Thank you. 
 

QUESTION PERIOD 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 

Global Transportation Hub Land Transactions 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, in December 2013 the GTH 
[Global Transportation Hub] purchased 240 acres of land from 
a Sask Party supporter for $21 million, millions more than the 
government appraisal said it was worth. But the GTH didn’t 
have the money to make that purchase until a deal from 
SaskPower arrived at just the right moment. Mr. Speaker, the 
then minister for SaskPower, Bill Boyd, asked cabinet to 
approve Sask Power’s purchase of GTH land. That same month, 
the then minister for the GTH, Bill Boyd, asked cabinet to 
approve the GTH’s purchase of Marquart’s land. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with Bill Boyd responsible for both the GTH and 
SaskPower, he didn’t even need the member from Saskatoon 
Willowgrove to strap on a sandwich board to help him make the 
sale. And now, Mr. Speaker, the land SaskPower bought in such 
a hurry sits empty, if you don’t count the tumbleweeds. How 
can the minister justify the millions SaskPower spent at the 
GTH as power rates for people of this province keep going up 
and up? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, going back to approximately 2009, SaskPower was 
looking for options and land around the city of Regina to 
consolidate 27 different facilities spread out over a dozen actual 
physical properties in and around the city of Regina. Many of 
those facilities were built in the 1950s and 1960s. They’re 
reaching the end of their useful life, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And so a number of options, over a dozen options were 
explored. In fact 13 options were explored, and it was felt that 
the Global Transportation Hub was the most . . . the best 
location for Sask Power’s consolidation. There were initial 
plans that were developed, but obviously with a changing fiscal 
time for the province, it was felt that now was not the time to 
proceed. 
 
SaskPower is looking at how to move forward with those plans, 
looking at the fact that the consolidation still needs to take 
place, Mr. Speaker. And I would expect over the coming 
months that the board will move forward with 
recommendations for plans. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, don’t forget: on top of this 



May 22, 2018 Saskatchewan Hansard 4347 

expensive land deal, SaskPower also had to pay $8 million to 
move a transmission line just to make way for the GTH. It’s no 
wonder that since the Sask Party government came in, people 
are paying 40 per cent more on their power bills. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, since 2014 when Bill Boyd headed 
SaskPower, the land has sat idle, accumulating bills at the 
taxpayers’ expense. Over that period, SaskPower has racked up 
an additional $4 million in costs, ranging from consulting fees, 
grants-in-lieu, and interest. The total bill for the land is now $29 
million and it continues to rise. But we hear these types of 
decisions are in the DNA of the Sask Party. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, how much more is this GTH land deal going 
to cost SaskPower and the people of Saskatchewan? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. As 
I said before, going back to, all the way to 2009, nearly a 
decade ago, SaskPower began to look for options to consolidate 
27 facilities across the city of Regina over, I believe, 12 
different sites in and around the city of Regina, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, they looked at 13 different options and felt, for a 
number of reasons, that the Global Transportation Hub was the 
best option to pursue, Mr. Speaker, including the fact that it was 
. . . the proximity to SaskPower’s fibre optics cable network, the 
fact that it had good highway and rail access, as well as the land 
that is owned by SaskPower on Highway 6, Mr. Speaker, is 
sitting on top of an aquifer and that there were environmental 
concerns with pursuing that option. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, SaskPower does intend to follow through with 
the consolidation, whether that be one consolidation or have a 
smaller footprint in the city of Regina over a smaller number of 
sites. But we felt over the last number of years it wasn’t 
appropriate to move forward on this, but we look forward to 
moving forward on it. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, last week, in what was among 
the strangest answers I’ve received in this Assembly, the 
Minister of Justice responded to questions about the millions 
spent at the GTH with a tirade about dirt. But the minister 
buried the lede, Mr. Speaker. We’re not worried about the dirt. 
We’re worried about the millions of additional taxpayer dollars 
that have been lost in the GTH money pit. 
 
Now in 2014, the former minister of Highways, the member 
from Indian Head-Milestone, decided to pay the GTH upfront 
for the dirt, knowing that the use of the dirt wasn’t his decision 
to make. That decision rested solely with the P3 [public-private 
partnership] conglomerate, Vinci and friends. 
 
Now that the Minister of Highways has confirmed that the dirt 
wasn’t needed, there are some questions and concerns that arise. 
Maybe the current minister could shed some light on this. What 
has the former minister told him about this deal? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Justice. 

Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I answered a question last 
week. Highways purchased this land from the GTH for borrow 
purposes in 2013; however the quality of the material from 
other borrow pits was unexpectedly good. I’m not an expert in 
dirt, as I’d indicated. So they didn’t use the GTH land for the 
borrow. As a result, the GTH will have to pay back the Minister 
of Highways the $2.86 million as future GTH land is sold. 
 
Mr. Speaker, right now it’s a net sum. It’s all an expense 
incurred by the taxpayer. It’s money owing to the taxpayers, 
whether it’s on the books of the GTH or whether it’s on the 
books of the Ministry of Highways. It’s an expenditure that was 
made. It was a legitimate expenditure that was made, Mr. 
Speaker. We make no intention of hiding it, masking it, 
whatever. It’s there; we’ve shown it. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, maybe it’s because the Minister 
of Highways didn’t get a legislative secretary that he can’t 
answer these questions. His lack of knowledge about this 
multi-million-dollar throwaway is concerning. In fact the 
flippant answers of the Minister of Justice on the wasted 
millions of taxpayers’ dollars is almost inconceivable. 
 
It’s this Sask Party government that is pushing people on the 
tightest of margins — people with disabilities, young families 
— out of the rental housing supplement to save $5 million, and 
then they scoff about the 6 million they wasted on dirt they 
haven’t used. So to the Minister of Highways: why did his 
predecessor agree to such a flawed contract? And what is he 
doing to get that money back? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Highways. 
 
Hon. Mr. Marit: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, as 
was just said previously in the previous answer, Mr. Speaker, 
Ministry of Highways acquired the land for borrow pits. The 
company that is doing the project on the Regina bypass did not 
need this land as the product they used out of the other borrow 
pits was far better. 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — I’m having a hard time hearing the questions 
and the answers. I recognize the Minister of Highways. 
 
Hon. Mr. Marit: — Mr. Speaker, and they found the product in 
the other borrow pits was far superior so they didn’t need to use 
the land that was acquired for the borrow pit. As my colleague 
said in his answer previously, it’s an asset that it’s holding 
there. And when the GTH sells the land, the money will go 
back to Highways as a payback. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 

Role of Legislative Secretaries 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, nearly 10 years ago the member 
for Regina Rochdale was the legislative secretary for long-term 
care. She wrote up a public report and in it she made some 
recommendations, some of which seemed like pretty good 



4348 Saskatchewan Hansard May 22, 2018 

ideas: “Provide Regional Health Authorities with targeted 
funding for home supports to bring Saskatchewan in line with 
the national average.” “Create a Seniors’ Secretariat within the 
Ministry of Health . . .” 
 
Unfortunately after nearly a decade, we’ve seen very little 
progress made on these recommendations from the last time a 
Legislative Secretary’s report was made public. Does the 
Minister of Health have any plans to act on these outstanding 
recommendations? 
 
[14:00] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Reiter: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
certainly we take any recommendations such as that seriously. 
We’ve done a lot of work with seniors across the province, Mr. 
Speaker. In fact I spoke at the Seniors Mechanism just last 
week, Mr. Speaker. 
 
As far as long-term care, we certainly have our challenges 
around the province. We inherited a massive infrastructure 
deficit on that, Mr. Speaker. We’ve built 12 long-term care 
facilities, Mr. Speaker, on top of the numerous hospitals and 
other health care facilities. Certainly, Mr. Speaker, we take all 
recommendations like this very seriously and we consider them 
within the budget every year. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, it’s disappointing that the 
minister won’t commit to implementing the recommendations 
from the member of Regina Rochdale. But at least with her 
report, we know what she did. We know what the 
recommendations were and we can hold the government to 
account for their lack of progress on these recommendations. 
 
But over the last number of years, this government has moved 
the goalposts for legislative secretaries, and not for the better. 
Rather than presenting reports to the public for everyone to see, 
it seems that legislative secretaries aren’t preparing much of 
anything at all. Our freedom of information requests for any 
reports or recommendations created by the legislative 
secretaries turned up nothing. 
 
On Friday the government announced 13 new legislative 
secretaries. Will they have to produce public reports like the 
member from Regina Rochdale did? What accountability will 
there be to ensure they’re actually doing work for the people of 
Saskatchewan? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wyant: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
the role of the legislative secretaries is to . . . [inaudible 
interjection] . . . The role of the legislative secretaries, Mr. 
Speaker, is to help with public engagement on the government 
side so they can help inform the ministers, Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to policy development and moving agendas forward. 
 
And I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Education, 
I’ve relied on the work that was done by a Legislative 

Secretary, the member from Churchill-Wildwood, on 
curriculum development, Mr. Speaker, a public report; the work 
that was done by former MLA [Member of the Legislative 
Assembly] Jennifer Campeau on bullying, Mr. Speaker. That 
was some work that we did some significant work on, Mr. 
Speaker, and that engaged in policy development on this side. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the legislative secretaries provide a valuable tool. 
And, Mr. Speaker, my mother used to say, you know you 
shouldn’t call the kettle black. When they were in government, 
they had legislative secretaries paid for the full amount of the 
amount that was required under the rules, Mr. Speaker. A 
modest amount of $3,000 to our legislative secretaries to help 
engage in public consultations, Mr. Speaker, to help guide 
public policy development is a good investment on this side of 
the House. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, if these legislative secretaries are 
going to be making recommendations to government, they 
should make these recommendations public. That’s the 
transparent thing to do. But at $3,000 apiece — that’s $39,000 
in total — it isn’t a whole lot for the government with a budget 
of more than $14 billion. But it’s . . . 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thank you. But it’s hard to justify when you 
consider how far that money could go in our communities. 
Thirty-nine thousand dollars could fund a full-time worker in a 
sexual assault centre or a full-time EA [educational assistant] in 
one of our overcrowded classrooms or provide mental health 
supports in the North. Is this really the best use of $39,000 
when so many are hurting in our province? Or is this really 
about topping up the salaries of government backbenchers to 
keep them in line? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wyant: — Mr. Speaker, the legislative secretaries 
that were appointed last Friday will receive a $3,000-a-year 
amount for the work that they’re going to be doing, Mr. 
Speaker. And I can tell you on behalf of the Ministry of 
Education, that’ll be valuable work that the Legislative 
Secretary is going to be doing for my ministry, Mr. Speaker. 
Certainly engaging the public in ongoing consultation, Mr. 
Speaker, so that we can get a broad perspective, a broad view of 
what people in Saskatchewan, what our stakeholders are 
thinking, Mr. Speaker, is a valuable resource to the Government 
of Saskatchewan. 
 
Contrary to the people on the other side of the House, Mr. 
Speaker, who paid $12,000 for legislative secretaries, and I 
don’t remember getting one public report or seeing one public 
report tabled on this floor of the legislature, Mr. Speaker, with 
respect to the work that they did. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 



May 22, 2018 Saskatchewan Hansard 4349 

Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, let’s recap. There won’t be any 
public reports. There won’t be any accountability. And there’s 
no commitment in completing the recommendations that have 
already been made. This is really about giving a $3,000 top-up 
to Sask Party backbenchers to keep them in line. 
 
For years the Sask Party legislative secretaries did their work — 
if they did any at all; we don’t really know — and only 
collected their MLA salary. But now we’re seeing an 
ever-growing roster of legislative secretaries claiming an 
ever-growing pot of taxpayers’ money to top up their MLA 
salaries. Will the minister finally drop his ruse? Will he go back 
to the Sask Party’s old ways of doing things and scrap the 
practice of paying top-ups to legislative secretaries? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wyant: — Mr. Speaker, I’ve stood and answered 
this question twice. The work that the legislative secretaries are 
going to do to support the ministers of the Crown on this side of 
the House will be very, very valuable work, Mr. Speaker. And 
to the extent that the member opposite speaks to the fact that 
legislative secretaries haven’t provided any value at all, I 
commented on the work that the member from 
Churchill-Wildwood did, Mr. Speaker, and we’re incorporating 
the recommendations that she brought forward on curriculum 
development, something that that the critic for Education I think 
is very interested in, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And the bullying report that came out from MLA Campeau, Mr. 
Speaker, those are recommendations that this government has 
acted upon as well. So to suggest that the work that’s being 
done by these legislative secretaries is of no value, I take great 
exception to that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And again I’ll repeat the point. Never have I seen any report 
from the opposition when they were in government where they 
filed reports on the legislative secretaries, who took a $12,000 
top-up, Mr. Speaker, with regard to their income, Mr. Speaker. 
A $3,000 amount for the significant work that we’re going to be 
requesting these legislative secretaries to do, Mr. Speaker, is a 
good investment for the taxpayers of this province. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 

Funding for Long-Term Care Facility 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Mr. Speaker, close to 100 long-term care 
residents will need to be relocated from their homes in Pioneer 
Village. This story is heartbreaking, but it certainly isn’t 
surprising. For years the Sask Party government has known that 
repairs and upgrades were needed at this facility, where there 
has been a boil-water advisory, asbestos remediation, elevators 
out of service — the list goes on. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that the situation at Pioneer Village is 
critical. The impacts on residents, their families, and the staff 
are significant. With no action from the Sask Party government 
to this point and no funding for a new facility in this year’s 
budget, can the minister explain how this situation is going to 
be fixed? 
 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Reiter: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We’re very 
concerned about this issue. Regina Pioneer Village was 
inherited by this government from the city in 2009. It had 
significant maintenance problems, Mr. Speaker. Since that time 
we’ve spent in the neighbourhood of $12 million on it to 
mitigate issues, Mr. Speaker. Recently we’re aware of a 
significant mould issue that’s gotten worse. Mr. Speaker, we 
want to ensure that all residents are safe. 
 
SHA [Saskatchewan Health Authority] officials are in the 
process of placing the 94 residents that the member opposite is 
speaking of in other facilities, Mr. Speaker. That’s imperative. 
Meanwhile I’ve asked officials from both the Saskatchewan 
Health Authority and from the Ministry of Health to provide 
some recommendations on where we go next, Mr. Speaker. I 
expect that report this summer. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Mr. Speaker, the minister’s words will mean 
little to the people relying on these services who have watched 
this facility fall apart for years. One resident said, and I quote, 
“I just don’t safe. Someone is going to get hurt.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, residents and families are rightfully worried and 
with one of the largest long-term care facilities no longer 
accepting patients, more stress will be added to our 
already-taxed health care system with more people waiting for 
long-term care. 
 
Over capacity issues and waits at hospitals will only get worse. 
Mr. Speaker, the minister has to stop spinning his lines and 
realize that people are suffering now and tell us what the plan is 
for Pioneer Village. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Reiter: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the minister isn’t 
spinning his lines. I very clearly indicated, I very clearly 
indicated what the go-forward plan is on this, Mr. Speaker. 
We’re extremely concerned about the residents. We’re making 
sure that the SHA officials do everything they can to make the 
transition for our residents as seamless as possible. 
 
Mr. Speaker, but let’s put this in perspective. She wants to talk 
about spinning lines. We inherited a massive infrastructure 
deficit. We have spent about a billion and a half dollars in 
significant capital and capital maintenance projects, since we 
formed government, in health care, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And you want to talk specifically about long-term care. Mr. 
Speaker, under the members opposite, 19 long-term care 
facilities in this province were closed. Mr. Speaker, under this 
government, 12 have been built. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 
Park. 
 



4350 Saskatchewan Hansard May 22, 2018 

Support for Sexual Assault Services 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, last week I asked the Minister of 
Justice to ensure that sexual assault services weren’t cut 
because of funding shortfalls. He said, and I quote, “We are in a 
process of finalizing budget, dealing with a number of issues on 
this. We recognize the challenges that exist.” But what we 
didn’t hear from the minister was a straight answer with a 
commitment for funding. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, it isn’t just Meadow Lake, Ile-a-la-Crosse, 
and The Battlefords area that are losing services. The Saskatoon 
Sexual Assault Centre had to cut their hospital support program 
for victims of sexual assault. So if the minister knows these 
challenges exist, why isn’t he providing the funding to address 
them? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the very 
valuable work that’s done by those agencies. Mr. Speaker, we 
will continue to work with them. We realize we’re in budgetary 
constraints but, Mr. Speaker, we do provide substantial funding 
for them: Battlefords & Area Sexual Assault Centre, $233,740; 
Lloydminster Sexual Assault & Information Centre, 102,700; 
Regina Sexual Assault Centre, 234,830; Saskatoon Sexual 
Assault & Information Centre, 181,610; Saskatoon Sexual 
Assault & Information Centre Inc., support for adult survivors, 
218,760; Society for the Involvement of Good Neighbors, 
117,800; Prince Albert Mobile Crisis Unit Cooperative Ltd, 
$111,010. Mr. Speaker, more work to do and, Mr. Speaker, we 
respect and value their work and will continue to work with 
them. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 
Park. 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, the Sask Party like to say that 
this is a priority, but Saskatchewan remains the only province 
without a sexual assault strategy, and none of this government’s 
talk is backed up with action. 
 
Important services are being cut. In Saskatoon, sexual assault 
reports to police have increased by 30 per cent in the last five 
years, and demand for support programs have increased as well, 
but funding for services has remained flat for years. There is 
nothing here for the minister to be proud of, and for him to 
quote those numbers as if that’s a good thing is shameful. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this issue is too important to be addressed with 
empty words from the Sask Party. Will the minister commit 
today to ensuring that the services cut will be restored? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, the issues of domestic 
violence, the issues of sexual assault are something that’s 
important to everybody that’s in this House. And there are 
things that we need to continue to work through, develop plans, 
develop strategies. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with regard to this area, we’ve made changes to 
allowing people to break leases. We’ve allowed for unpaid days 

off at work. We have consultation under way with regard to 
Clare’s Law, which will give the police the opportunity to 
maybe pre-empt an act of violence before it occurs. We’ve 
allowed for legal advice to be given to people on an ongoing 
basis and, Mr. Speaker, we’re the only government that’s 
introduced another outreach centre or another transition house 
since 1989. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 
Park. 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what I need to do 
to get the minister to change his lines. Sexual assault strategy is 
very important. Domestic violence strategy is very important as 
well, but the two are not necessarily the same. The minister 
should not be quoting supports for survivors of domestic 
violence when we’re talking about sexual assault. 
 
So I’m going to ask a question that I asked before, that he did 
not answer, one more time: will the minister commit today to 
ensuring that the services cut from sexual assault centres will be 
restored? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I’d indicated earlier that 
we want to work with those agencies. We want to make sure 
that we’ve got a good, cohesive plan as we go forward and, Mr. 
Speaker, those are things that we intend to do. 
 
The work that is done by the sexual assault centres and the 
transition houses in our province — and I agree with the 
member opposite you can’t intermingle them — but the fact is a 
lot of the services are delivered by the same service providers. 
 
[14:15] 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, we want to continue to look after and do the 
best thing that we possibly can to ensure that those services are 
continued. We realize that in our province we do have an 
ongoing problem, and we want to make sure that we do 
everything that we possibly can to make sure that those 
agencies are adequately funded, that we look to make sure that 
we’re not duplicating resources, that we’d look at the best 
models for service delivery. And once again, Mr. Speaker, I 
want to make sure that I reiterate the thank yous that we have 
for those people. 
 
Sexual assault centres have asked for a further meeting. We’ve 
agreed to that meeting, Mr. Speaker, and we’ll see where we go 
as we go forward, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Fairview. 
 

Job Numbers and Provincial Economy 
 
Ms. Mowat: — Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan’s job market 
continues to be in recession and this government has offered no 
solution. The April job numbers showed a decrease of 1,800 
jobs and the government has no plan to create jobs, and all 
they’re worried about is balancing their mismanaged budget. 
Instead of helping the people of Saskatchewan find work, they 



May 22, 2018 Saskatchewan Hansard 4351 

cut saskjobs.ca to make it even harder for them, a decision they 
quickly reversed, proving once again that this government is 
more of the same — short-sighted and reactionary. 
 
Mr. Speaker, my question is, when will this government deliver 
a plan for creating jobs in a diverse economy instead of burying 
their heads in the sand and cutting from programs designed to 
get people back to work? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Trade. 
 
Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. The fact 
is that this province has one of the best job creation records in 
the entire country over the course of the last decade. Over 
62,000 jobs have been created in this province, Mr. Speaker, the 
second-highest rate of job creation in the entire country, versus 
their record which was dead last over their last 10 years in 
government, Mr. Speaker. 
 
But one of the most important issues, pressing issues facing the 
country right now has to do with the Kinder Morgan pipeline, 
Mr. Speaker. They have had literally nothing to say on the 
issue, Mr. Speaker. They’ve been hiding under a pile of coats. 
But one of the NDPers [New Democratic Party], one New 
Democrat who hasn’t been hiding under a pile of coats is their 
federal leader. And let me read to you, Mr. Speaker, what he 
tweeted, his position on this issue: 
 

Liberals are giving Texas oil company #KinderMorgan a 
blank cheque while dumping all the risks on Canadians. 
 
Rigged process, First Nations & local communities shut 
out, oil spill threats, science ignored . . . billions on the 
line. 
 
It’s clear this pipeline should not be built. 

 
That’s the position of their federal leader, Mr. Speaker. 
 
On this side of the House, we’ll stand up for the economic 
interests of this province and this country. We will fight for this 
pipeline. We wish they would do the same. 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the member on her feet? 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, point of order. 
 
The Speaker: — Sorry. Why is the member on her feet? 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — What’s your point of order? 
 

POINT OF ORDER 
 

Ms. Sarauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Pursuant to rule 52, 
I’m simply asking . . . The Deputy Premier had referenced in 
his answer some recommendations from a document from when 
the former member from Saskatoon Fairview and the member 
for Saskatoon Wildwood were legislative secretaries. Some 
recommendations were . . . [inaudible]. We are asking that they 
please table those documents. Thank you. 
 

The Speaker: — Okay. All right. Well under rule 52, you must 
have . . . the minister had to quote the document. They’re not 
obliged to table a briefing note. But I’ll tell you what. 
Voluntarily I’ll review, be happy to review and will report back. 
Thanks.
