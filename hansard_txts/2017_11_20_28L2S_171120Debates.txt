 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 2973 
 November 20, 2017 
 
[The Assembly met at 09:30.] 
 
[Prayers] 
 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 

The Speaker: — Members of the Legislative Assembly, it is 
my honour today to introduce to you a group of teachers who 
are here in the legislature to attend the 19th annual 
Saskatchewan Teachers’ Institute on Parliamentary Democracy. 
The institute began on Saturday, November 18th and will 
conclude on Tuesday, November 21st. I would ask all members 
to welcome this group to the Saskatchewan legislature. 
 
I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Ms. Eyre: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to 
join with you in welcoming, in your gallery, 2017 participants 
in the Social Studies Teachers’ Institute program here at the 
legislature. Their names, Mr. Speaker: Ms. Karen Hovind, 
Christy Harrick, Krysten Nixon, Cindy Thomson, Shelly 
Horrocks, Michelle Hanna, Carey Crossman, Andrew Rondeau, 
Ian Elliott, Kayla Henderson, Matthew McMillan, Dane Smith, 
Doreen Netmaker, Margot Keeler, and Mr. Michael Wolf, and 
Andrew Kitchen. 
 
And with the steering committee, Mr. Speaker: Ms. Karen 
Blackwell-Jones, Mr. Terry Leibel, Mr. Douglas Panko, Ms. 
Shayna Zubko, Ms. Delise Pitman, and Mr. Matt McGuire, 
who’s a teacher, a guest teacher from Virginia in the States. We 
welcome them to this Legislative Assembly, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 
Lakeview. 
 
Ms. Beck: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to join with the 
Minister of Education to welcome these social studies teachers 
from across the province. I hope that you’ve had a productive 
weekend, and I want to just thank you for the important work 
that you do in our schools across this province. I look forward 
to joining with the Minister of Education this evening at your 
closing banquet, and perhaps getting a chance to speak with 
each of you a little bit further. And I invite all members here to 
welcome these very important guests to their Legislative 
Assembly. 
 

QUESTION PERIOD 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Global Transportation Hub 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, every single day we stand up in 
this House and we ask questions about the GTH [Global 
Transportation Hub], and every day the Premier tries to wave 
off the concerns being raised by Saskatchewan people. So let’s 
set aside the land sales at the centre of the Sask Party’s GTH 
scandal for just a moment. 
 
The Premier says the GTH is creating jobs. But because of a 

loophole that government refuses to close, not a single foreign 
company that sets up shop at the GTH will have to hire a single 
Saskatchewan worker. 
 
The Premier also says government money is being well spent, 
but the GTH is losing money every single year. Last year alone, 
they budgeted for over $15 million in revenue and a surplus of 
over $4 million. But they fell $10 million short of their planned 
sales and lost $1 million of Saskatchewan people’s hard-earned 
dollars. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the member for Meadow Lake, his leadership 
campaign lasted just long enough for him to share his true 
feelings about the GTH. He questioned the economics and said, 
“We should have never been in this business in the first place.” 
Does the Deputy Premier agree? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Economy. 
 
Hon. Mr. Bonk: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We’re very proud 
of the immigration record we’ve had in this province. Over 
92,000 immigrants have arrived in Saskatchewan since 2007, 
adding to our record population of 1,163,925 residents. From 
1997 to 2006, only 18,000 arrived in Saskatchewan as 
permanent residents. Comparing the two ten-year periods, 
immigration landing rose by over 395 per cent. We’re very 
proud of our record, Mr. Speaker, and we’ll stand by it. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Premier can 
completely try to avoid all of these questions, but all he wants 
. . . but the people who are continuing to run to lead his party 
say that the GTH is in the top three questions they get from 
every single person they talk to. And, as Rob Clarke likes to 
point out, everyone running for leader was either on the front 
bench or in the backroom for the “scandals and insider deals.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, the member for Saskatoon Willowgrove said he 
would “. . . immediately begin action to sell the GTH to the 
private sector.” The member for Saskatoon Northwest said, 
“It’s unacceptable to me and to the people of Saskatchewan that 
after all this time, there are still more questions than answers 
when it comes to the GTH.” And he and the member for Regina 
University have joined the call for a full public inquiry. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with all but one Sask Party leadership candidate 
calling for more transparency and answers, why has the Premier 
not yet even allowed Laurie Pushor to testify publicly? And if 
the Premier doesn’t trust him to testify publicly, why does he 
still have a job with the government? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Environment, 
GTH, and SaskPower. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, there was much that was problematic with the 
preamble of the Leader of the Opposition’s question, but I do 
note, Mr. Speaker, that she did note a very fulsome leadership 
campaign that’s taking place on this side of the House where six 
individuals are seeking the leadership of the Saskatchewan 
Party, as opposed to the members opposite where they can only 



2974 Saskatchewan Hansard November 20, 2017 

find two people to run for the leadership of the party. In fact the 
leadership was open for an entire year before anybody wanted 
to step up to run for that outfit, Mr. Speaker, and of course, 
people that have already run once and lost on several occasions. 
 
With respect to the Global Transportation Hub, Mr. Speaker, 
this is an organization that has created over 800 jobs, over 1,800 
construction jobs, over 450 million . . . 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Over $450 million in private investment 
in less than five years in operation. This is a generational 
opportunity for the province of Saskatchewan, and we’re going 
to do everything we can to see that it’s a success. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — Mr. Speaker, they’re playing 
pass-the-hot-potato to the ministers today, and not a single 
answer about Laurie Pushor — no surprise. Mr. Speaker, there 
is a pattern here. In every case of a scandal, the Sask Party 
MLAs [Member of the Legislative Assembly] close ranks and, 
as the member from Meadow Lake put it, they “repeat the 
position of the government.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, what we need are for more of them to come clean. 
We know Bill Boyd and Laurie Pushor were at the centre of the 
GTH scandal. We know Joe Donlevy, the Premier’s chief of 
staff, was kept in the loop. And we know that cabinet approved 
the sales that put millions into the pockets of Sask Party 
supporters. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we also know that the Sask Party government 
have done all they can to stop Mr. Pushor, Mr. Boyd, and Mr. 
Donlevy from testifying publicly. Mr. Speaker, the Premier 
himself chose the member for Saskatoon Northwest to be his 
minister responsible for Justice, so why is he not taking his 
advice now when he says, “The only way to lift the cloud over 
the GTH is to shine a very bright light and very public light on 
the entire matter”? Why won’t the Premier or the Deputy 
Premier shine this important and bright light? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Global 
Transportation Hub. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, we’re certainly not going 
to take any lessons from a New Democrat party when it comes 
to openness, when it comes to transparency, and when it comes 
to accountability. 
 
It was this government that asked the Provincial Auditor to look 
into this matter. It was this government that opened all of the 
cabinet material and made access to all the cabinet material to 
the Provincial Auditor, an independent officer of this 
Legislative Assembly. We didn’t have the deputy minister to 
the premier, the hand-picked deputy minister to the premier, do 
an investigation as the members opposite did with the SPUDCO 
[Saskatchewan Potato Utility Development Company] matter. 
That’s not what we did. 
 

We opened this up to the Provincial Auditor, an independent 
officer of this legislature. And the Premier has committed, Mr. 
Speaker, that once the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police] investigation is complete, that he hasn’t ruled out taking 
further action on this matter. So we will not be listening to the 
advice of the members opposite who have a very poor track 
record when it comes to openness and accountability and 
transparency. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 

Regina Bypass Project and Land Acquisitions 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, that minister can say what he 
wants, but we know the Premier is on his way out and the 
people trying to replace him are clearly concerned about the 
Sask Party’s scandals. Mr. Speaker, most people already know 
that the Sask Party handed a $400 million project to a foreign 
conglomerate and then let it balloon to a massive $2 billion. It’s 
taking up 60 per cent of this year’s total highway budget. But 
that doesn’t include the significant amount of land the 
government had to expropriate for this project. And, Mr. 
Speaker, even though millions of Saskatchewan taxpayers’ 
dollars were spent, we don’t know from whom the land was 
bought and which sections were expropriated. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that information is public, but unless the minister 
steps in, it will take a lot of time and taxpayers’ money to get a 
hold of it. The minister has the power to help. If the Sask Party 
are genuinely proud of this project, will the minister ensure that 
all of this public information is made readily available? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Highways and 
Infrastructure. 
 
Hon. Mr. Marit: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m getting tired 
of hearing the rhetoric from across the way, Mr. Speaker. This 
is not a $400 million project. This is a $1.8 million project. This 
has gone from 3 overpasses to 12 overpasses, Mr. Speaker. It 
has gone from over 50 kilometres of highway infrastructure; it 
has gone to 40 kilometres of twinned lane and 50 kilometres of 
access lanes, Mr. Speaker. 
 
This is a major project for the province of Saskatchewan. It’s 
the largest infrastructure project we’ve had in the province’s 
history, Mr. Speaker. It is going to create economic 
development in the Global Transportation Hub. And it’s going 
to allow traffic to flow around the city of Regina in a safe 
manner, and it’s going to give safe traffic to the transient people 
moving in from Balgonie, White City, Emerald Park that are 
driving into Regina to do their work, Mr. Speaker. This is a 
great project for the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, question period isn’t about 
Whac-A-Mole of the ministers over there. This is about getting 
the right minister up to answer the question. 
 
This is a question about public access to information through 
the land registry. We’re talking to the Minister of Justice, not 



November 20, 2017 Saskatchewan Hansard 2975 

the Minister of Highways. We’re talking about millions of 
dollars of land purchased with Saskatchewan people’s tax 
dollars. Seventy-two parcels of land were expropriated and 112 
more parcels were purchased outright, but we don’t know and 
we can’t get the information on which are which or who owned 
them. Saskatchewan people deserve to know how their money 
is being spent and who’s profiting on this megaproject. 
 
The Sask Party say they have nothing to hide about these deals, 
so I ask again: will the Minister of Justice work with us and the 
office of the public registry administration to make sure the 
information of the land purchased for the Regina bypass is 
made public and accessible so Saskatchewan people can learn 
the truth? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Highways and 
Infrastructure. 
 
Hon. Mr. Marit: — Mr. Speaker, once again I want to say this 
is a major project for the province of Saskatchewan, Mr. 
Speaker. This has gone from a $400 million project — which 
they think it was, which was only on the east side of the city — 
to a $1.8 million project for around the bypass around the city 
of Regina. It has gone to 12 overpasses, Mr. Speaker; 40 
kilometres of twinned highway, Mr. Speaker; and 50 kilometres 
of highway access off this bypass, Mr. Speaker. 
 
It is a major project for the province of Saskatchewan but more 
importantly, Mr. Speaker, this is a safe project for everyone 
living on the east side of Regina that wants to commute in to the 
city and for businesses to do business out there, Mr. Speaker. 
There’s over 800 jobs in the community of Emerald Park that 
are commercially related where people are working and thriving 
in this province, Mr. Speaker. This is a good project for the 
province of Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 
Lakeview. 
 

Support for Treaty Education 
 
Ms. Beck: — Mr. Speaker, there’s a lot of agreement, including 
from the Premier, that the minister had to apologize for her 
statements made during her Throne Speech response. And she 
did make several apologies, but none of them were for her 
actual statements. When I pointed out the confusion the 
minister was causing with her non-apologies, she said that she 
apologized for “. . . any misinterpretation or any intentions or 
confusion that resulted from . . . [her] comments.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, she’s being accused of calling treaty education 
into question and drawing equivalencies between the experience 
of Western Europeans and indigenous people. She is sorry that 
other people misinterpreted her, and is sorry that they were 
confused. Mr. Speaker, that’s not an apology. If the minister 
can’t stand in this place and take full responsibility for her own 
words, why does she think that she deserves to be the minister 
in charge of our kids’ education? 
 
[09:45] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 
 

Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, while I’m on my feet, I 
would like to thank the opposition, people working in House 
services, the staff of the building that made the shift in times 
possible for today, Mr. Speaker. There’s a saying that you can 
do anything with consent, but there’s also a lot of people that 
have to put the paper, the organization, everything. So I’d like 
to use this opportunity to thank everybody that worked together 
to make that . . . [inaudible]. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with regard to the member’s question, the minister 
has apologized and has apologized unequivocally for everything 
that took place. Mr. Speaker, this government and the minister 
stands fully behind treaty education. We have it throughout our 
school system. We have in every school in the province, Mr. 
Speaker. That is the position of the minister. That is the position 
of the government, and, Mr. Speaker, that will remain the 
position of this government and this province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we’ve had ongoing discussions with First Nations 
leaders, Mr. Speaker, and we’re on a path towards 
reconciliation and we’re fully supportive of that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 
Lakeview. 
 
Ms. Beck: — I’m glad to hear that that’s the path we’re on, Mr. 
Speaker, and I hope that the Minister of Education is fully on 
that path as well. But every time she talks about treaty 
education, she sounds like the member from Meadow Lake who 
admitted he was just “repeating the position of the 
government.” 
 
What does she actually believe? We’ve all heard stories about 
that, but let’s look at her comments from the Speech from the 
Throne this month. While discussing the infusion of treaty 
education and the need for context, the minister said: 
 

And if you don’t know that 230 years ago French 
revolutionaries called their movement Citizenship, or that 
later Maoists were very partial to school children singing 
indoctrination songs, or that the key tenet of cultural 
Bolshevism was prominently displaying ideological slogans 
in schools, how do you know what rights, responsibility, 
and respect are . . . ? 

 
Mr. Speaker, last week the minister finally and reluctantly 
admitted there was no equivalency between what her ancestors 
faced when they came here and what indigenous people faced. 
What equivalency was she trying to draw between Bolshevism 
and treaty education? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, the minister apologized for 
the statements that were made. The minister clarified the 
statements that were made. Mr. Speaker, this government 
supports treaty education. This government supports the 
relationship that we have with First Nations. This government 
supports the relationship that we have with the Métis people in 
our province. There are ongoing issues that we have to work 
with them. We will continue to work through those issues, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 



2976 Saskatchewan Hansard November 20, 2017 

And, Mr. Speaker, we’re not going to stand by and let the 
members opposite pick and choose from words that were made 
in a statement where people talk about their family, where they 
talk about their history. Mr. Speaker, we support this minister. 
We support the relationships that we have with First Nations 
and Métis people in our province. That is where our 
government is going, Mr. Speaker. 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, that’s where this 
government is going and, Mr. Speaker, we’d like to urge the 
members opposite to join with us and continue to develop the 
relationship that we have with First Nations and Métis people in 
our province. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 
Lakeview. 
 
Ms. Beck: — Mr. Speaker, we are fully on board to continue 
with that relationship, but there is some accounting for here. 
Those were the minister’s words and they’re not mine. She was 
implying that teachers are failing and that treaty education was 
pushing out other lessons. She went on to express her 
frustration about the teaching of “rights, responsibility, and 
respect.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, she made it clear that she is upset that rights, 
responsibility, and respect are in the curriculum as “intentional, 
explicit mandating.” Mr. Speaker, she then asked, “How can 
you analyze them in their fullest, most critical context?” Mr. 
Speaker, that coming from a minister who still hasn’t accepted 
responsibility for her own words or shown respect to those that 
she offended. 
 
In her speech, the minister quoted an October 30th Globe and 
Mail column, but she missed some important context from that 
article. The author of that article ended with “When it comes to 
shaping young minds in particular, we should praise science 
and call out distortions of truth on both sides.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, if the minister agrees with this column that she 
cited, how does she justify not accepting responsibility and 
stepping down? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Ms. Eyre: — Mr. Speaker, again I apologize and reaffirm 
the commitment of this government to unequivocally support 
continued, mandated treaty education in the schools of this 
province so students will continue to be taught treaty along with 
their regular subjects, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The First Nations and Métis education fund, Following their 
Voices, Help Me Tell My Story, the invitational shared services 
initiative, and the increase in pre-kindergarten and other 
childhood programs — these are all a testament to our 
commitment to increase First Nation engagement and success. 
And this year we have seen moderate success, Mr. Speaker. We 
are proud, proud of the fact that in 2016-17, 43.2 per cent of 
First Nations and Métis students graduated on time, compared 

to only 35 per cent in 2012. This is the highest graduation rate 
in over 20 years, Mr. Speaker. There is still work to do, but let’s 
try to do it together. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Opposition House Leader. 
 

Access to Bus Service 
 
Mr. McCall: — Mr. Speaker, in three separate elections, the 
Sask Party promised they wouldn’t sell off our Crowns. Then of 
course they scrapped STC [Saskatchewan Transportation 
Company]. They brought in Bill 40, and now of course they’re 
selling off STC piece by piece. They say it’s different because it 
was a wind-down. 
 
Well May 3rd of this year, Mr. Speaker, the Premier admitted 
that they needed Bill 40 to do what they did to STC, our Crown 
that binds us all together. The people of Saskatchewan then 
spoke out. The Premier said, “We’ve heard you.” Yes, Mr. 
Speaker, on October 24th he took to Facebook and promised, 
and I quote, “Our government is repealing Bill 40.” And just 
two days later, he said again that he doesn’t think wind-down 
counts. So they’re keeping that part of Bill 40, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the routes have been on the auction block, the 
depot in Regina has just been sold, and the buses are up for sale. 
That Premier said they were listening, and he made a promise. 
So why are they ignoring Saskatchewan people’s clear intent 
and breaking their promise yet again? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Environment, 
GTH, SaskPower, and SaskWater. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
think, as the minister has indicated on a number of occasions, 
the wind-down of STC was not an easy decision to make. It has 
been a challenge for governments going back a number of 
years, the fact that it was not profitable and it was not going to 
be profitable ever. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I could say that it hasn’t 
made a profit, STC had not turned a profit in my lifetime, 
literally in my lifetime. 
 
It was a tough decision. It was reviewed and explored by 
various ministries and in the end it was decided that the money 
that was being spent on a subsidy, which was estimated to be up 
to $100 million over the next five years, that it wasn’t . . . We 
weren’t able to continue forward with it, and so that’s why we 
made what is a difficult decision. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Opposition House Leader. 
 
Mr. McCall: — Mr. Speaker, in a well-hyped Facebook video, 
the Premier looked Saskatchewan people right in the monitor 
and stubbornly refused to admit he was wrong. But he did admit 
the people disagreed. He said, “You believe the sale of any 
stake, any part of a Crown corporation, is privatization . . .” 
 
Mr. Speaker, mental health counsellors, indigenous leaders, 
community members are speaking out. They’re worried 
Saskatchewan will get our own highway of tears. We’ve all 
heard or read the stories. Since those members voted to scrap 
STC, people are facing harassment, assault, and even worse 
while hitchhiking. 



November 20, 2017 Saskatchewan Hansard 2977 

Mr. Speaker, they promised in three elections, and just last 
month, that they would not privatize. They said they understood 
that that meant any part of a Crown. STC was a Crown 
corporation that belonged to all of us. It wasn’t a business. It 
was a service that saved lives. Now looking at the real human 
consequences, how can they justify scrapping STC instead of 
saving it, saving lives, and keeping their promise to scrap Bill 
40? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Environment, 
GTH, SaskPower, and SaskWater. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — With all due respect to that member, he 
was a minister of the Crown on this side of the House when that 
government closed routes, and all of those things would apply 
to people living on those routes who no longer have the service. 
In my constituency, communities all across my constituency in 
the Big Muddy Valley had their routes closed. 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, for anybody in this 
province who had a route closed — and in 1993 and 1994 there 
were over a dozen routes closed — for those people, that meant 
the bus company was shut down. In effect it was shut down. So 
if that member can stand and say that all of those things are true 
today in terms of what people face without having a bus 
company, then surely it would have been true in 1993 and 1994 
and every other year that the NDP [New Democratic Party] shut 
the bus company down. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 
Centre. 
 

Usage of Government Email 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, the Premier seems to have gotten 
used to his government email server being broken, and even 
though he promised that he would not use it again, he now says 
there is nothing wrong with him using his partisan email 
account or even a Gmail account for government business. 
 
Mr. Speaker, no matter how you feel about keeping a promise, 
surely we can all agree that the Premier, any premier, should be 
able to count on their government email account to do their job, 
even though there’s no proof it was down for two weeks in 
September. That’s what the Premier’s office claims. 
 
So can the minister responsible for government emails, the 
Minister of Central Services, please update the people of 
Saskatchewan on what work her ministry has done to fix the 
problems with the Premier’s government email account and to 
investigate and address any issues with reporting issues? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Central Services. 
 
Hon. Ms. Tell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — Would the member who asked the question 

please have the respect to listen to the response from the 
minister . . . [inaudible interjection] . . . Whoa. And on the 
government side, please be respectful for members opposite. I 
recognize the minister. 
 
Hon. Ms. Tell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The system that we 
use or have used in the past and up till very, very recently is a 
system of taking tapes and having them transcribed by an 
outside agency, the same system, Mr. Speaker, that was used 
under the members opposite. 
 
So to update the members in this House here today with respect 
to the tapes — the recordings, the emails, whatever the case 
may be — technology has changed. And as a result of that, we 
have now taken to improving how we’re capturing the 
information and storing the information, Mr. Speaker. 
 
In the past what has happened is that the tapes — the tapes, Mr. 
Speaker, and I know that’s somewhat of a foreign word here in 
today’s world — were sent out to a company in Toronto to 
extract the information. Hence the huge cost. That was the same 
procedure that was used by the members opposite when they 
were in government, Mr. Speaker. So today we’ve started a 
project with respect to the information that we have captured, 
and we’re moving it into the cloud so that it will keep 
information in a better way, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 
Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, I encourage the minister to listen 
to the question. We weren’t asking about storage. We were 
asking about complaints. 
 
Here are the facts, Mr. Speaker. The Premier says he was using 
the Sask Party email or even Gmail for government business. 
The Premier promised to stop using his private email, but then 
he used it again. The Premier’s office told the media his 
government email wasn’t working for the better part of two 
weeks in September, but there are no records at either Executive 
Council or Central Services that show a complaint was even 
made in September, let alone one that shows his email was 
down. No records at all, Mr. Speaker. This is disturbing to say 
the least. 
 
[10:00] 
 
Mr. Speaker, what kind of government are they running if they 
can’t even get the Premier quasi-reliable email service? Is the 
Minister for Central Services not concerned at all? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — You know, Mr. Speaker, I’m glad that 
we don’t have question period every morning. They’re a feisty, 
scrappy lot today. 
 
But I would say this to the member opposite: the Premier has 
answered this question, and has answered it any number of 
times. He’s indicated that he will make his best efforts to ensure 
that he uses the government email server. There are times, for 
whatever reason, he has not had access to that. Whether it has to 
do with his device, whether it has to do with things in Central

Services, he periodically will use his own. 
 
He has indicated that when he uses his own, that all of that will 
be made available through Archives. They’re subject to FOI 
[freedom of information]. Not hiding a thing. Mr. Speaker, 
when they ask questions about those things, they don’t remove 
the header when they send out the responses. They just show, 
that’s what it was. There’s nothing to hide there. They’re 
welcome to the information any time they want it. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I do now move 
that this House adjourn for the day. 
 
The Speaker: — Pursuant to an order made Thursday, 
November 16, 2017, this Assembly stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. 
 
[The Assembly adjourned at 10:01.]
