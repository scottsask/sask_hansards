ORDERS OF THE DAY 
 

GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
 

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 
 

Motions for Interim Supply 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Mr. Chairman: 
 

Resolved that a sum not exceeding $304,049,300 be granted 
to Her Majesty on account for the 12 months ending March 
31, 1988. 

 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — Is this when I can ask some questions? I 
thought that was the case. We won’t take too long if we get the 
right answers, Mr. Chairman. 
 
Mr. Minister, this is the fifth interim supply Bill, and that’s 
unusual in itself, but we also had an interim supply Bill at the end 
of last month which created some unnecessary difficulties for 
some municipalities throughout the province, thanks to the failure 
of the Minister of Urban Affairs to notice that that was a problem 
with the Bill. 
 
But I will leave that part of it alone for now and simply ask you, 
Mr. Minister: do you this time have enough funding in this Bill of 
interim supply to provide the quarterly funding to municipalities 
who have had to borrow money either on the market or borrow 
money internally, which in the end cost them interest and therefore 
still was a cost to the municipalities and therefore the taxpayer? Is 
there a quarterly provision to make payments to municipalities so 
they don’t have to undergo that problem and difficulty again? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — The motions make provision for four months’ 
interim supply for local governments. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — Thank you. so clearly since this is the 
second time in this session that it is done, I think it’s important we 
put the record straight, because the Minister of Urban Affairs has 
been going around the province not being quite accurate with the 
people he speaks to and saying that the reason why the funding 
wasn’t made available is because the final budget vote hasn’t been 
taken. 
 
Mr. Minister, you’re confirming here, I would assume, that it is 
not necessary to have a final vote on the final budget, interim 
supply Bills. You can have the quarterly, and you could have had 
it last month as well. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well certainly if the hon. member is 
  



 
October 30, 1987 

3704 
 

asking — and I think it should be on the record as well — that 
when we have interim supply Bills, that instead of doing them in 
the traditional way, which is one month interim supply until the 
budget is voted, with some rare exceptions, if you’re asking that 
we now change that, and in our first interim supply Bill we make 
provision for all organizations that need funds during the balance 
of the year pending passage of the budget, then that is a rather 
dramatic change from the past practice. 
 
Now I’m prepared to consider that if that’s the wish of the 
opposition. But let me suggest to the hon. member, in fairness, that 
it’s not only local governments, urban or rural, that need moneys 
during the year and that have to borrow. If we . . . For example 
we’ve had, on earlier interim supply, we’ve had additional moneys 
for school boards. We’ve had additional moneys for expenditures 
on different programs, student aid, all of these things which take 
into account more than one-twelfth. 
 
Now I know the political debate that we’re involved in, but I 
suggest to the hon. member if you are in fact arguing that our first 
interim supply Bill during the course of budget debate should have 
additional funds to cover all organizations that would have to 
potentially borrow during the course of the year, I’m prepared to 
consider that. But to single out as . . . to single out one recipient of 
public moneys, we can make that debate. But I suggest to the hon. 
member that there are many exceptions to the one-twelfth. 
 
We have treated those, I believe, generally fairly throughout the 
course. But if we’re now advocating that our first Appropriation 
Bill include additional expenditures to cover off all those 
organizations who may have to borrow because the budget’s not 
approved, I’m prepared to consider it. I had hoped that you would 
be forthright, if that’s your broader argument, above just talking 
about local governments, because it’s an important debate. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — I would be more than happy to clarify, Mr. 
Chairman. No, that is not my broader argument. That’s not the 
issue here at all. 
 
And I suspect the issue may never have arose — I shouldn’t say 
that so readily — but it may never have rose to the heights that it 
did except for the misleading statements that the Minister of 
Urban Affairs was making to municipalities and to the press. He 
knew very well that there could have been, in the last interim 
supply Bill, enough money to provide the quarterly payments. 
 
Now, Mr. Minister, there’s a difference between providing from 
time to time in the interim supply Bill — because you have to 
have one every month — but from time to time providing enough 
money to make payments on a quarterly basis, or whatever basis 
you make them on, without the need to provide it all in the first 
interim supply Bill. 
 
Quite frankly I, as one, and I’m sure that the members of the 
opposition would object to having it all provided for in the first 
interim supply Bill. That’s why, Mr. Minister, you have the 
authority under the rules of the House to come in here every 
month and get your interim supply.

The solution to the problem is, stop applying the kind of ridiculous 
mismanagement that this government has been applying and have 
a budget that comes in when it’s supposed to come in. 
 
(1030) 
 
The budget, other than this year, has always come in at a time 
which provided sufficient time for debate, provided information to 
third parties and municipalities so that they would know what their 
funding is going to be, and there always had to be some interim 
supply Bills — this isn’t a new innovation — and then things 
turned out okay. 
 
The reason why we are faced with the problem is, first of all, 
because the government chose to bring the budget in on June 17, 
some several months later than it should have; and secondly, 
because in interim supply Bill before this one you did not make 
provisions to provide the funding to municipalities which you 
made provisions for in your first interim supply Bill in June. 
 
So I would suggest to you, Mr. Minister, the simple solution, the 
simple solution is, get your act together, and . . . (inaudible 
interjection) . . . Well the member from Regina South uses the 
words that he wants, Mr. Chairman. That’s not the word I used. 
All I can say to him is that if you walk like a duck and you sound 
like a duck and you look like a duck, you’re a duck. 
 
Mr. Minister, I want you to know that the simple solution to this 
thing is, bring your budget in next year, now in 1988, in March or 
February, and the problem won’t exist. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — That’s the only point I want to make here. I 
don’t want to drag this on because I think we’ve had sufficient 
debate on interim supply Bills in the past. Our points have been 
made; they will be made again in other forums. But if you can at 
least stand up in this House today and tell us that this time, for the 
next budget, you’re going to have it here before the 1st of April so 
that the people who are partners with the government, so that they 
can have the funding they need to get their work done, can be 
assured what they’ll have; then I think I will have no further 
questions. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — We could debate this for some time but I 
think the proof, the proof will be in the pudding in that in next 
year’s interim supply, if the principle being articulated by the 
member from Regina North East is that we should take into 
account those organizations that get public moneys during the 
course of the year, may have to borrow for a quarter or some . . . in 
some cases, to the hon. member, with respect, there are some 
organizations out there that get their moneys from the government 
on a monthly basis, and if the interim supply would cover that. In 
some cases they argue most strongly that they should know and 
have their moneys fully in advance. And I can think of many 
third-party organizations that ask for that, that they would like 
their moneys up front so that they finance during the year. 
 
So to single one recipient out as having a problem — and 
  



 
October 30, 1987 

3705 
 

I’m not arguing that they don’t have a problem — I think does not 
recognize that there are other organizations, and that if we are to 
now change interim supply to take into account . . . And you have 
to, I think, in fairness, make the argument in the first interim 
supply that all organizations that would receive funding 
throughout the year should get it in the first interim supply so they 
don’t have the problem . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Well, the 
fact is that the hon. member says that the timing of the budget . . . 
certainly that is a factor this year, and we haven’t denied that in 
any interim supply. 
 
But I suggest to the hon. member that even if a budget is in time 
we still have interim supply Bills. Sometimes the sessions have 
been dragging on into June and interim supply — and that’s a 
quarter in many cases — and we have to . . . 
 
An Hon. Member: — We never had a problem in the past. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Oh yes, we have. The hon. member knows 
full well that there has been cases in the past. So yes, we can make 
the first interim supply . . . Technically you could make your first 
interim supply your full budget for the year if you wanted to 
debate that, and I don’t think that’s a practice we want to start. 
 
Mr. Van Mulligen: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don’t know 
how many years the Government of Saskatchewan has been 
operating, or how many years they’ve been providing 
revenue-sharing payments to municipalities but, Mr. Minister, 
we’ve never seen a problem up until this year and, to a very 
limited extent, last year. Mr. Minister, you talk about tradition. 
Let’s recognize that the reason we have a problem is because you 
chose to delay bringing in a budget until June of this year. And if it 
were not for that, there would not have been a problem; there 
hadn’t been problems in the past. You’re the one that breaks with 
tradition when it seems to suit your purposes. 
 
I want to just get it clear. Urban municipalities that receive more 
than $30,000 in revenue-sharing payments receive those payments 
in four equal instalments, and the payment dates are June 1, July 1, 
October 1 and December 1. 
 
Can you now assure us, and can you assure municipalities 
unequivocally, that they will receive in this interim supply Bill all 
funds that should have been due to them by October 1? That is to 
say that they will have, as a result of this interim supply Bill, 
three-quarters of all the money that should be coming to them this 
year, and in fact all the money that should have been due to them 
by October 1. Can you give us that unequivocal assurance? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Yes, I can, to the hon. member. I would, 
secondly, like to make the point that we’ve now had, as the 
opposition financial critic indicated, we’re now on our fifth 
interim supply Bill and Appropriation Bill, and I think many 
people, and I know many people in urban governments are 
surprised that the opposition didn’t raise the problem before this. 
 
Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Minister, again you’re blaming the 
opposition for your own incompetence. That’s a new

one, but we expect just about anything from you when it comes to 
cheap political shots, Mr. Minister. 
 
I just want to say that I thank the minister for his assurance that 
municipalities will have all funds due to them that should have 
been due to them October 1, even if we are now at the end of the 
month. And I want to thank him for that assurance, and I think that 
all municipalities and all of us can rest assured that there will not 
be any further problems in this regard. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions. 
I just want to make it very clear to the minister that there is a 
procedure which would be very helpful to him or any future 
minister who may occupy his position. 
 
First of all, I know that the municipalities will be glad that their 
provision is being provided here today, and we’re only too pleased 
to support that. We would have supported it if it had been 
provided the last time. 
 
Secondly, I would recommend to the minister, very highly, that in 
future for interim supply Bills that he, as I used to do before him 
before 1982, and others before me, should consult with the 
opposition on an interim supply Bill. I mean, it’s highly unusual 
for interim supply Bills to be controversial. 
 
In advance of the Bill being in the House — and I say that not in 
any critical sense; I’m offering it as, I think, constructive advice 
and suggestions — consult with the opposition or with the 
opposition critic, give us an advance copy of the interim supply 
Bill so that we can take a look at it. 
 
And I can assure him that under normal circumstances the passage 
of interim supply Bills, if it’s straightforward, including quarterly 
payments if they’re necessary, would get by this House in a matter 
of a very few minutes, and all it would take is a consultation and 
some advance information, as I must say, Mr. Chairman, to the 
credit of the minister, he did provide in his first interim supply 
Bill. 
 
That’s all that’s necessary, and I think we would then in future 
save us the need for some further questions and debate and 
difficulties that are created for people out in the field. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Just in response to the hon. member, I 
appreciate his comments, and I’m reluctant to put the broad 
interpretation on his comments that if the opposition has advance 
copies of the interim supply Bills, that the debate will be rather 
brief. I think, in fairness, and I respect that interim supply always 
has been — and I would be reluctant to see it changed — as an 
opportunity for the opposition to debate rather wide-ranging 
topics. It’s been a tradition of this House, and I suppose in the 
future we will see whether advance notice tends to shorten debate 
or not. 
 
Motion agreed to. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: 
 

Resolved that towards making good the supply granted to 
Her Majesty on account of certain

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 
 

Consolidated Fund Budgetary Expenditure 
Finance 

Ordinary Expenditure - Vote 18 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I introduce 
my officials — and we have apprised the 

member from Regina North East of a printing error on the 
Estimates — the total dollars are not affected in any way. And that 
requires a motion, moved by myself, seconded by the member 
from Turtleford: 
 

That the following erratum for the Estimates for the fiscal 
year ending March 31, 1988 for Finance which has been 
tabled in the Committee of Finance, be adopted: 
 
Due to an administrative error the following corrections 
should be made: 
 
In the Estimates of Finance, Vote 18, page 41, the details 
should read as follows: 
 
Remissions under The Department of Finance Act, 1983 . . . 

 
And the numbers are set forward and the same for: 
 

Interest on tax overpayments pursuant to section 56 of The 
Department of Revenue and Financial Services Act 
(Statutory) . . . 
 
. . . the detail, therefore, should read as follows: for Finance, 
Vote 18, page 44 . . . Distribution of the above: 
 
Statutory Appropriation (and the numbers are in the motion) 
— 77,757,500 (estimated ’87-88) and; 
 
To be voted — 60,453,300 
 
For a total of $138,210,800. 

 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — And then, Mr. Chairman, if I may introduce 
my officials in the Assembly: Mr. Jack Vicq, acting deputy 
minister; Keith Laxdal, associate deputy minister of revenue, 
pensions, and administration: Bill Jones, assistant deputy minister, 
investment and financial services division; Gerry Kraus, 
Provincial Comptroller; Bill Van Sickle, executive director, 
administrative division; Mike Shaw, executive director, budget 
review, treasury board division; John Wright, executive director, 
taxation and economic policy division; and Bob Blackwell, 
director of operations, treasury board division. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — Mr. Chairman, we’ll agree that this motion 
be passed, because an error has to be corrected. I just noticed 
something here that I wasn’t able to ask the Minister earlier in our 
conversation. 
 
Mr. Minister, under item 14, the number change is really quite 
extensive from . . . this is interest on tax overpayment pursuant to 
section 56. In ’86-87 there was an estimated $100,000, but you tell 
me that that is now being changed to $600,000. Can you explain 
what the reasons are, and the circumstances behind such a big 
change in that amount of money? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Under The Department of Revenue and 
Financial Services Act, I’ll give you the section if you wish, 56(6): 
any interest paid to a taxpayer by the department on an 
overpayment of tax is considered a 
  



 
October 30, 1987 

3707 
 

statutory expenditure. 
 
Presently interest is only paid on overpayments of corporation 
capital tax because of that tax. Corporations are required to make 
monthly instalment payments of the tax. These payments are 
based on their estimate of the tax for the current year. At the end 
of the year when the corporations file their returns, their payments 
are compared to their actual tax liability. If the corporation has 
under-remitted tax, it receives interest, and interest is paid out of 
this subvote. Interest on the corporation capital tax overpayments 
were previously paid out of the revenue division subvote. So that’s 
the difference. 
 
Motion agreed to. 
 
Item 1 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — I’m afraid not, Mr. Chairman, not for a 
little while. I think that when I rose to ask the question on the 
motion I did not also extend my greetings, and the greetings on 
behalf of the opposition, to the officials, and we look forward to 
them providing the answers to the minister so that we can deal 
with these estimates in an expeditious way. 
 
I want to begin, Mr. Chairman, by outlining to you and to the 
House, in a general way, some of the areas or some of the general 
themes or concepts around which we will be basing our questions. 
I have a number of questions which I want to deal with, quite a 
large number of questions, and I want to ask them of the minister 
here today, and whatever time it takes. And I know that some of 
my colleague do as well have questions that they want to pursue 
also. 
 
I want to say, first of all, that throughout the consideration, Mr. 
Minister, of your estimates, some things are going to underline all 
of the questions that we ask. 
 
First of all, after six budgets presented by your government since 
your election, I think it’s clear that there has been established by 
this government a litany of mismanagement never before 
imagined possible in Saskatchewan. Most people agree with that 
in Saskatchewan today. They are deeply concerned about where 
we are at, and they are deeply upset about why we got here. 
 
All of those things that generations of Saskatchewan people have 
worked hard to build in this province, to better this province, to 
make it better for themselves and for future generations, in these 
short five years, because of the kind of mismanagement we’ve 
seen, have either been destroyed or given away or put in great 
danger of an early demise because of the continuing 
mismanagement hat we see before us since even 1986, October of 
1986. 
 
(1100) 
 
And secondly, Mr. Minister, your government and you, yourself, 
have deliberately disregarded the processes of democratic 
government and disregarded the people of  

this province and their role in this process. And you have said to 
them in your statements, and you have said and shown to them in 
your decisions and by your actions, that most people don’t count, 
except maybe at election time. 
 
That is a concept of government that, I think, in a democratic 
society is extremely objectionable. And the things that we’re 
going to ask you and speak about in these estimates are going to 
emphasize that because we’re concerned about that aspect of it as 
well. 
 
And thirdly, Mr. Minister, as I said in my response to your budget 
speech on the day and the day after your budget, this budget can 
be described only as a budget of betrayal, nothing less. You and 
the Premier and your colleagues were dishonest with the public. 
You continue to be dishonest with them about your future plans 
for this province, because there are indications that you intend, as 
a government, to do things which are not in the best interests of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
You don’t give the people a chance to have their say bout them. 
And then you just simply plough ahead and do what you like, 
disregarding their views and their opinions and their aspirations 
for the future of Saskatchewan. 
 
You’ve led this province form a surplus of $140 million in 1982 
— it is recorded in statements provided to this House and to the 
public by the former minister of Finance — you took this province 
from a surplus of $140 million in 1982 to a deficit of $3.4 billion 
in 1987 - 88. 
 
I say to you that when oil prices were under $9 a barrel in 1977, 
the former government had a balanced budget. You had oil prices 
at $30 a barrel, and you piled up a huge deficit, and you had a 
deficit every single year. And now you complain about oil prices 
being $18 a barrel, or whatever they might be today, and you 
blame your deficit on that. 
 
And when the price of wheat was $2 a bushel or less than $2 a 
bushel, we then balanced the budget, as a former government, 
before 1982 as well. You now blame your mismanagement, and 
the farmers, who are struggling to survive, on them and the 
difficulties that they face. 
 
And everything you do in this budget makes, Mr. Minister . . . 
(inaudible interjection) . . . Mr. Chairman, when the member from 
Wascana, who speaks from his seat, will settle down, I will 
continue my remarks. 
 
Mr. Minister, everything you do in this budget makes a difficult 
situation which was created up until now, even worse. And I’m 
going to refer to some of those things, and you may want to 
respond to them. 
 
First of all, when you were elected in 1982 and again in 1986, 
there were certain expectations that people had of you, as they had 
of every other government before you. And it is only right that 
they should be able to have those expectations. But they should 
have those expectations even more strongly felt when they are 
made certain promises by a political party which then happens to 
become the government. In your budget, you betray those 
promises. 
  



 
October 30, 1987

You said that as long as a Conservative government was in power 
there would never again be a gasoline tax. Now some people will 
argue one way or the other on the gasoline tax, but the issue is, 
you said there never would be one. 
 
This year there is one, and its application is probably 
administratively bad to the extent that I don’t know how your 
administrators are going to manage it. It is being applied 
extremely unfairly and is being used as a method to shift even 
further the tax load to property taxpayers through increased costs 
to municipalities and school boards. 
 
You said that you would do away with the sales tax. You’ve 
increased it by 40 per cent. You said you would decrease the 
income tax by 10 per cent. Everybody knows that the flat tax is 
increased in this budget this year. And it goes on and on and on, 
and I could give you examples which I won’t bother to at this time 
because I think those highlight the kind of betrayal we’re talking 
about. 
 
Now you say in your budget that the government can’t afford to 
maintain the health programs of this province. That’s what you 
say, that’s what the Minister of Health has said, and that’s what 
the Premier continuously says as he travels around this province: 
we can’t afford our health care programs. But, Mr. Minister, you 
have done nothing to reduce the cost of those health care 
programs. 
 
You have done nothing to reduce the cost of those health care 
programs. All you have done is shifted that cost from the 
provincial treasury, which can spread it out over a large tax base, 
and you’ve put it on the backs of people who have to take part and 
have to have those services. And you’ve even made it worse by 
allowing some of those costs to go up unnecessarily, as is the case 
with the patent drug legislation, which you supported in Ottawa, 
which is going to increase the cost of drugs — by that one Act 
alone over the next five years — by $75 million to Saskatchewan 
residents. There has not been a saving in the cost; there has been 
an increase in the cost. And you’ve said people who get sick and 
people who get old and children who should be getting dental care 
are now going to have to pay more. Those are the kind of priorities 
that I think are the highlight of this betrayal which we’re talking 
about. 
 
The whole problem has been the kind of mismanagement and 
waste of public money which has led to a situation which I want to 
ask you about after I talk about this thing. 
 
Let’s look at this mismanagement and let’s look at where it has led 
us. Let’s look at this legacy which you’re leaving behind and your 
predecessor is leaving behind. I refer you to page 41 of your 
budget speech. It’s interesting to note where we have been and 
where we are today. And I also refer you to page 79 of the budget 
of 1982. Because I think between those . . . a comparison between 
those two statements there is a clear indication of how bad your 
mismanagement has been. 
 
Let me bring your attention to non-reimbursable debt. Well you 
know what non-reimbursable debt . . . I’m not 

sure all the public does, but I think many of them do. There are 
two kinds of debt that the province has. There is reimbursable debt 
— that’s debt that’s incurred because you go out and you borrow 
money for the power corporation or Saskatchewan 
Telecommunications or other public agencies, Crown 
corporations. They earn income and they repay that debt through 
the income that they earn. 
 
Non-reimbursable debt is money that the government borrows and 
then the taxpayer has to pay out of their pocket — the taxpayer has 
to pay out of their pocket. What has happened to this 
non-reimbursable debt during the term of this government? 
 
Well December 31, 1981 the non-reimbursable debt was $380 
million. Now it’s startling to note that that non-reimbursable debt 
is estimated by March 31, 1988 to be $2,585,837,000. Now that is 
shocking — that is shocking. This debt which you have 
accumulated is going to cost the taxpayers this year $300 million 
to service. They’re going to get nothing for it, but they’re going to, 
through their taxes, before you put one single cent in highway 
maintenance, they’re going to have to shell out $300 million to 
pay the interest to some places, mostly out of this country, that you 
have to borrow this money to pay for the cost of this 
non-reimbursable debt. 
 
Were that it only would end here, but it doesn’t, because I want to 
now talk to you about the gross debt. And here the situation is just 
extreme. The gross debt on December 31, 1981 for the province of 
Saskatchewan, where you accounted for the reimbursable debt and 
the non-reimbursable debt, was $3.283 billion, quite manageable 
— quite manageable. 
 
Let’s look seven, or six years later. What is this total debt of the 
province of Saskatchewan today that you project in your budget 
on page 41? You are saying to the public that the gross debt is 
now $1.506 billion. Now that’s a 300 per cent increase, Mr. 
Minister, because you frittered it all away — because you frittered 
it all away. 
 
Because you decided in 1982 that management of government 
was absolutely unimportant, that management was not necessary. 
You simply had to address the political issues, and you simply 
could solve them by sending out more money, or you could pay 
off your friends by telling them they don’t have to pay their fair 
share of the taxes. And so you said to the oil companies, that’s 
okay, you’re doing pretty good right now, but we’re going to 
forgive $300 million a year of your royalties. 
 
So what you have done by those kinds of actions, Mr. Minister, is 
increased the gross debt from $3 billion to $10 billion. Now $10 
billion, Mr. Minister, of debt for the province means that for every 
soul, every man, woman, and child in Saskatchewan there is now a 
debt of over $10,000. 
 
Now, Mr. Chairman, that’s a considerable debt. If a child is born 
right at this minute in Saskatchewan, that child is born into a debt 
of $10,000 because of the mismanagement of this government. 
  



 
October 30, 1987 

3709 
 

Let me just highlight the kind of mismanagement by giving you an 
example. In 1982-83, Mr. Chairman, this government said that the 
deficit for the province would be $219 million. Was it $219 
million? No, it was $227 million. 
 
In 1983-84 they said the deficit would be $316 million. Was it 
$316 million? No, it was $331 million. And this is while the 
former minister of Finance was saying, well you know, we are 
going to get deficits under control. 
 
In ’84-85 the minister of Finance stood in this chair in this place, 
and he said the deficit would be $267 million. It ended up being 
$379 million. In ’85-86 the minister of Finance said the deficit 
would be $291 million. It doubled to $584 million. 
 
And in 1986-87, Mr. Chairman — you notice it kept getting worse 
every year — in ’86-87 we had this new Minister of Finance who 
was supposed to bring hope and salvation, and he said the deficit 
would be $389 million, and it ended up being $1.2 billion. 
 
(1115) 
 
Now I know estimates are estimates, but nobody who is being 
honest with himself or with the public can underestimate that 
badly. So, Mr. Minister, it’s that kind of mismanagement, it’s that 
kind of six deficit budgets in a row — every year that this 
government has been in power — that has led us today to have 
this gross debt of $10 billion and now is being used by this 
government to cut essential services that are causing suffering and 
pain from one end of this province to the other. They’re using it as 
the cover — the cover. 
 
Mr. Minister, we are now seven months into the year, your fiscal 
year. Seven months into the fiscal year you ought to be able to tell 
this House whether this saga or horror story is going to continue. 
Seven months into the year you should be able to say in your 
estimates whether you are confident that you will be within your 
budget projections or whether you will be over it; and if you’re 
going to be over it, you should be able to tell this House by how 
much. If you can’t do that first off in the consideration of your 
estimates, then clearly the story since 1982 is a story that has yet 
not ended. 
 
And so I ask you, Mr. Minister, first of all, as we are now nearing 
November 1, are you going to in this budget be within your 
estimate? Are you going to have your deficit at $577 million? And 
if not, how much will it deviate one way or the other? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — At this stage we expect to meet our budgetary 
and deficit targets. There will be two major variables, of course, 
that may lead to some difficulties. 
 
One, we’re not sure yet what the international markets are going to 
do to interest rate. We did, as we had debated before, had an 
interest rate estimate set out. If the rates are held low, by 
particularly the actions of the G-7, we may be in a better position 
than we had expected 
.

Secondly, there is some preliminary indications that perhaps the 
revenues on the oil side from leases may be higher than we had 
anticipated. I can only speculate on those because we simply don’t 
have precise information. We were concerned three weeks ago 
that we were going to be under pressure with more expenditures 
on interest rates. The hon. member I’m sure knows that rates 
quickly started to move upwards three weeks ago, and then it was 
an intervention done quite literally overnight, an agreement to 
dramatically drop interest rates. 
 
So we simply can’t say with precision what will happen in those 
two areas, but we overall are quite confident, at least at this stage, 
of meeting our targets that have been set out. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — Mr. Minister, just to comment on your 
comment about the interest rates. I would hope that none of us 
would want to rely on the stock market too many times to lower 
interest rates, because that’s really what has caused all this to 
happen. I’m not knocking the fact that we’re getting lower interest 
rates. I have a mortgage that I renew next June as well. But I think 
there are other implications. 
 
But let me just pursue this a little further. I hear you say that you 
feel that you’re going to be within your budget projections in this 
budget, as of the seventh month of this fiscal year. Now the 
indications are there. Can I ask you: how do you know that? I 
mean, how do you find this out? I’m sure you don’t take it out of 
the air. What’s the process that tells you how this happens? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well as we’ve debated before on statements 
and everything else, they are . . . and I very carefully said earlier 
that we estimate. I’ve thrown some variables which . . . in interest 
rates. It’s now not a matter of month-to-month variations on 
projections. The information in that case came in within 24 hours 
of a major shift in trends. So we do try and assess as we go 
through the years, the hon. member knows, but they are estimates. 
 
And what I’ve tried to do was give to you some of the broader 
questions that could impact on our overall estimates for the year, 
and I’ve given you two of the major ones. But that’s at this stage. I 
mean, no one is sitting here predicting that if two months from 
now the lowering of the interest rate has started an inflationary 
spiral — I don’t expect that, but that’s just from general advice as 
opposed to anything specifically — but if it were to start an 
inflationary spiral because of the sharp drop in interest rates, 
would there then be a correction upwards two months down the 
road? 
 
So they’re estimates; they continue to be estimates; that’s why 
they’re called estimates. I’m trying to give you the overall that we 
will try . . . and we expect to meet our targets. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — I guess, Mr. Minister, on a monthly basis 
somebody reports to you that here is what the revenues are up 
until now and here is what the expenditures are. I believe that’s the 
process. Is that what you’re telling me? 
  



 
October 30, 1987 

3710 
 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — We get the estimates of cash receipts, cash 
disbursements on a monthly basis. We haven’t got anything 
precise as yet; I’m giving you my expectation when I see the 
interest rates drop, which was contrary to the trend, that I see that 
as a variable that probably affects in a positively way what 
happens in the final numbers. But yes, we get those expenditure 
and receipts on a monthly basis. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — I understand that, and I wanted to hear it 
from you, Mr. Minister — not that I doubt what is reported by 
your officials. But in the Public Accounts Committee that was 
outlined to us very clearly, that you and all members of the 
treasury board, as has happened before in 1982, and I 
complimented the department for doing this, do get a statement of 
outflow and inflow — outflow of expenditures and inflow of 
revenues — on a monthly basis, prepared some times every two 
weeks. 
 
So that information is made available to you, Mr. Minister, and to 
other members of the treasury board, and I might add, used to be 
made available to the Premier — I hope still is. Being that he is the 
president of the Executive Council, I would think he might be 
interested in knowing the affairs of the province. So I wanted to 
establish what the process was. 
 
That being the case, Mr. Minister, I want to ask you: since that 
information was always available to you even in 1986, why did 
you not know in September of 1986 and August of 1986 that your 
deficit projections of $389 million was not going to be $390 
million? Why did you inform the Premier to travel the province 
and promise to everybody that the deficit would definitely not be 
above $500 million, when in fact you announced in March it 
would be $1.2 billion? Did you not read that information, Mr. 
Minister, or were you misleading a Saskatchewan public 
deliberately? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — We’ve debated this several times. Let’s take a 
look at the ultimate deficit figure that we have debated many 
times, and take into account what we could have done. 
 
Sixty million dollars of that ultimate increase was a reduction in 
the estimated value of land bank land transferred to the ag equity 
corporation. We got, much later in the year I gather, some rapid 
reappraisals. The reappraisals were being done during the course 
of that year as to the valuations, and they continued to drop 
throughout the year. We very much indicated that we were not 
taking the $100 million we could have taken and that we had 
proposed to take from the Liquor Board. 
 
We certainly had increased expenditures on the home program. 
We had done an estimate, you may recall, and we debated this in 
the Assembly, as to what the reserve would be under the 
production loan program, and the reserve that we had chosen for 
the 1986-87 budget was the reserve that the Canadian Wheat 
Board uses for its cash advance program. 
 
And throughout the course of that year — and I gather much later 
in the year — the Provincial Auditor had some concerns as to 
whether that reserve for loss exposure was high enough. We then 
chose — we could have had a 

lengthy debate with the Provincial Auditor as to whether who’s 
right, who’s wrong — we chose, for the purposes of the deficit, to 
increase that by $110 million. We could have, we could have 
maintained the position throughout the year, of the Canadian 
Wheat Board reserve. 
 
We indicated about $70 million in miscellaneous 
over-expenditures, one of which I think, if I recall — and I’m 
subject to correction, but if I recall, $18 million for salary 
settlements in health care. And the hon. member knows that those 
have not been put into the budget of the year. 
 
An Hon. Member: — Loose change. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — No, no. I’m not suggesting that. But what I’m 
saying to the hon. member that the salary settlements that are 
negotiated after the budget have historically been brought in to the 
following year, and not in the year because you don’t want to 
prejudge and send out a signal as to what your amount of moneys 
you’re putting on the table for salary. And that’s been the longer 
term practice of the government, and I think not an unwise one. 
 
We chose to begin to write off losses in Sedco (Saskatchewan 
Economic Development Corporation). Saskatchewan Forest 
Products, STC (Saskatchewan Transportation Company). Now 
that’s not a decision that we had to make. But we did choose to do 
that. The big variation, the big single variation is the drop in 
resource revenues. And I suggest to the hon. member that I’m not 
aware of any financial adviser, industry analyst, that predicted 
during the course of that last fiscal year the drop in oil prices to as 
low as $10. 
 
As a matter of fact, when we did a quick comparison of the 
estimates, we were actually closer on our estimates of oil revenues 
than the province of Alberta was. And I would suggest that the 
province of Alberta has a very intimate knowledge and 
understanding of the oil industry, perhaps better than any other 
jurisdiction in Canada. So you know, some things that we chose to 
bring into the deficit we did deliberately. We’ve debated that on 
many occasions so far this session. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — Mr. Minister, you chose to inflate this 
deficit. You chose to do that so that you could do all of those 
devastating things that you’ve been doing since March, or even 
earlier, of this year. You misjudged by $700 million. 
 
If you think anybody believes you when you say that, Mr. 
Minister, that somehow there were unforeseen circumstances, I 
simply say to you that you’re the same minister who made a 
guarantee to the citizens of Saskatchewan that the prescription 
drug plan would never have the deterrent fees. And you expect 
them to believe you when you say you didn’t mislead them on the 
deficit. 
 
(1130) 
 
You’re the same minister who said in 1986 that your deficit would 
be $389 million, and now you come up with some stories about 
why it’s not. You’re the same 
  



 
October 30, 1987 

3711 
 

minister who said the people of Saskatchewan that the sales tax 
would be done away with, and in your budget this year you’re 
increasing it by 40 per cent. 
 
Mr. Minister, it’s a question of your credibility, as it is the 
question of the government’s credibility. Are you saying to this 
House then that oil prices after October of 1986 went down, or did 
they go up, Mr. Minister? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — I can indicate that by August prices went 
below $10 a barrel, and that was a rather dramatic drop after the 
budget. Okay. 
 
But then an OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries) agreement increased it to 15 in . . . That was the August 
OPEC agreement. The December agreement — and there was 
volatility within that period of time between August and 
December — got prices into the 15 to the $18 range. Okay. 
 
For ’86-87, WTI west Texas intermediate crude prices average 
$15.29, which was 24.2 per cent below the budget projection. 
 
Of the revenue shortfall — and I’ll break it down for you — on 
the oil side there was a decrease in the royalty tax and other oil 
revenues, a virtual elimination of the bonus bid revenue, and then 
reductions in credits as a result of the activity to the temporary 
service and supply employment program. 
 
Mr. Tchorzewski: — So, Mr. Minister, you knew by August 
what the price of oil was going to be. You knew by August that it 
had dropped to $10 a barrel, and yet through August and through 
September and through October you still tried to say to the public 
of Saskatchewan that your projected deficit was going to not 
change. In other words, Mr. Minister, you misled them. Your 
Premier did the same. He knew in August what the price of oil 
was going to be, and as a matter of fact from then on it went up. 
 
When I spoke earlier about mismanagement and about political 
decision making on a partisan way, with total disregard to fiscal 
needs of this province, you have just confirmed it. You knew what 
the situation was going to be, and you didn’t tell the public. You 
hid your deficit. 
 
Now, Mr. Minister, can you explain why, as a responsible member 
of a government, you would have not told the public the truth 
about what the price of oil was going to do to your revenues from 
oil? Can you say that and explain it today? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — We simply couldn’t tell, because the . . . well 
it had dropped down to 10; it had dropped down to 10. And I’ve 
already just read into the record the August OPEC agreement got 
it back up. There was a subsequent agreement that got it back up 
further, and so to argue that anyone in the industry knew what the 
price was going to be during the course of that year, I frankly think 
is not fair, because there was so much volatility. I mean, I just take 
a look at the graph for oil price flow — again west Texas 
intermediate crude prices — and a dramatic drop, and then the 
gradual track back up again. 

So again the estimates were . . . we certainly didn’t estimate a drop 
down to 10. I don’t think anybody predicted a free fall down to 10, 
and no one again expected later in the year that it was going back 
up to 18. 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Chairman and Mr. Minister, I want to 
focus in on the comments made by you and the Premier during the 
election campaign that the deficit would be 500 million. And you 
have told us today that one of the main reasons — you have 
confirmed what you said in writing in March of this year, in the 
course of your Saskatchewan economic and financial report, that 
one of the main causes for the large increase in the deficit from the 
400 million or so that you predicted in March, from the 500 
million which you predicted in October, to the 1.2 billion you 
reported in March — you say one of the main reasons was a $350 
million drop in resource revenues. 
 
Mr. Minister, you knew by October when you were telling the 
public that the price of oil had dropped. You knew that six months 
had gone by during which period the price of oil was much lower 
than your prediction and therefore that the revenues would be 
much lower than your prediction. You knew that there would be a 
substantial shortfall. You knew that in order to get back the 
revenue which you had predicted, the price of oil would have had 
to go to 25, 30 or more dollars a barrel. And yet in October you 
quoted a figure which did not take into account sharp drops in oil 
revenue which had already taken place, and in respect of which 
there was no reasonable prospect that they would ever be caught 
up. And they weren’t, and they haven’t been. 
 
Now why, Mr. Minister, did you not level with the public? No one 
is quarrelling with you for not being able to predict oil prices, 
particularly. We are quarrelling with you for saying, when you 
knew that the money had been lost, for saying in October, don’t 
worry the oil money is in, or will be in, and the budget deficit will 
be around the $500 million mark. Now speaking of oil revenue, 
how can you justify not taking that into account in calculating the 
figure of 500 million which you gave to the public during that 
campaign? You knew it. Why didn’t you level with the public? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well I’m somewhat surprised because the 
hon. member usually knows what’s going on. But, did I know 
during the course that oil prices had gone up in August? yes, I 
knew that. Did I know that they had gone down in July? yes, I 
knew that. We also . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . No, I said that 
the August Agreement brought them back up to the $15 range. 
There was an international movement, I think it fair to say, 
amongst oil producing nations to try and get some . . . the price 
back up again, and that was public information. 
 
We did have, and we were unable to predict, for example, what 
the bids were going to do on the land sales. We had two in that 
time which we had to take a look at. And who knew? I mean, as 
the hon. member knows, that’s going to depend on not only prices 
but how the industry views the opportunities. As well, we don’t 
know until we get into near the year end and I’m not even

sure, in many cases, you know precisely then with the impact of 
the equalizations is a result of the drop in revenues. And to put 
those factors and say that you can, with precision, tell us what’s 
going to happen, I don’t think is accurate. I mean I can throw in 
the effect of equalization, of the agreement signed in 1981, which 
caused over the last five years to pay back $123 million because of 
overpayments prior to 1982. 
 
And so those calculations, and as the hon. member knows full 
well, you may get an adjustment equalization, two and three years 
down the road, back on revenues before. I mean, that’s the way the 
. . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Well the hon. member says that 
that’s not right, those are in fact the cases that you can get 
readjustments of your federal equalized payments, equalization 
payments, down the road. 
 
So those are variables and to argue that people knew with 
precision is simply, you know, I mean, it’s a debating point but not 
factual. 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Chairman and Mr. Minister, I am 
asking on what basis you told the public there was a deficit of 500 
million when you knew that it was much higher. And the fact that 
equalization payments, two years hence, might bring a 
readjustment doesn’t in any way bear on what you said the deficit 
would be for this year. 
 
Now, Mr. Minister, are you saying you did not know what you 
told us in March, that the revenue . . . that there would be a very 
substantial drop in resource revenues, you did not know that in 
October? Are you saying that the information which was on your 
desk, which comes to you monthly, didn’t show that you’d already 
suffered most of that? 
 
Are you denying that information or are you saying that by some 
miracle between October and March there would be a great inflow 
of money because the oil price would go up to $30? Which is it, 
Mr. Minister? You had suffered the loss by October. You knew 
that oil revenues were much lower than you had estimated in 
March. By what magic did you think that those revenues were 
going to come up to your estimate? By what magic did you think, 
therefore, that your deficit would be only 500 million and not the 
1.2 billion you were forced to admit was the case in March? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — So the hon. member understands, when I said 
that equalization can be adjusted two and three years down the 
road, I indicated that as a general statement on equalization. You 
do get your adjustments. When you approach your year end, you 
get a closer estimate of what your equalization is going to be. 
 
Keep in mind the approximate dates that I gave of increases back 
up on oil revenues. In August there was an OPEC agreement, and 
I think I indicated December there was a further OPEC agreement. 
I mean there was so much volatility in that international oil 
industry through the whole course of 1986, and to argue that it was 
based purely on supply and demand which would give some 
precision up or down, of course is not factual.

(1145) 
 
There was, through that whole process, there was an excess of 
supplies, and it was a matter of whether those oil producing 
nations were going to withhold supplies from market. And those 
are not decisions to which we’re privy until they are finally made. 
And in the case of 1986, even once they were made by OPEC, for 
example, they weren’t necessarily being carried out by many of 
the producing countries. So we certainly indicated that they would 
be down. 
 
Remember as well, with respect . . . that even when we did our 
budget in last year, when we came in with an estimated price for 
oil, we came in considerably lower than what the federal 
government had done. 
 
So, yes . . . I’m not sitting here denying that it’s not an estimate; it 
certainly is an estimate. But to argue that there was any precision 
at any time during the year on oil prices so that you could know 
what your revenues were going to be, you know, it just wasn’t 
there. They were estimates, and that’s why we call them estimate, 
as the hon. member knows. 
 
But secondly, in terms of the oil industry during 1986, to deny a 
great deal of volatility and to deny that there weren’t efforts by 
producing states to try and get prices up after the free fall is not 
realistic. 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Minister, you are 
saying — and I want to underline this, because we’re dealing with 
a budget which deals once again with your estimates — and 
you’re saying that you made a little error of $350 million when 
estimating last March what the oil revenues would be. And you 
said, well of course it’s 12 months into the future, and there’s no 
precision. 
 
But you’re now saying that in October you’re still estimating. You 
were still making a $350 million error for a six-month period — 
on this one issue alone, a $350 million error of how much money 
you’re going to take in in a six-month period. 
 
Now that is pretty impressive when it comes to making errors — 
pretty impressive — and casts . . . like the thirteenth stroke of the 
clock makes you question not only that estimate, but all the other 
ones you’ve presented to this House and are presenting to this 
House today. 
 
Now let me turn to another matter which you might say you didn’t 
have any knowledge on. When in October you were saying that 
the deficit would be 500 million, how much did you believe would 
be spent on the home program, which wasn’t even in your budget 
at that time? You had announced it before you said that the deficit 
would be 500 million. Now you’re saying, well, well, we spent 
120 million which wasn’t in our estimates and that’s why the 
deficit was up. 
 
But you knew, Mr. Minister, you were going to spend that money. 
You were busy spending it in September and October. Now why 
didn’t you acknowledge that? Why didn’t you level with the 
public and say that that would be added to the deficit, as you were 
forced to level with the public when you gave your figures in 
March?

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Let me state, there were two oil sales, lease 
sales, September, December. There certainly would be some 
expectations when price had gone from 10 back up to 15 and 18 
that we would have done better in oil sales. The fact is, we didn’t 
in both of those. And I gave you the example of the December 
OPEC agreement which got the price back up into the 15, 18 
range. Oil sales turned out in December of that year to bring in 
only $2 million. The expectation would have been with price that 
we would have started getting back some increase in revenue. But 
it simply didn’t happen. 
 
On the home program, I think we can debate, if the hon. member 
is stating that the home program and expenditures were unwise, or 
the amounts, Mr. Chairman, I think we can go through a rather 
vigorous debate of programs. And I think the hon. member’s 
political party had, during the course of not only the provincial 
election campaign but leading up to from the announcement of the 
NDP home program, I would guess that we had at least, at least 
during that six-month period, at least 64 different announcements 
of what the NDP home program was going to cost, because every 
single candidate out there was giving a different statement and you 
had several conflicting party statements as to what your program 
was going to cost. 
 
So if you want to have that political debate as to the knowledge 
. . . (inaudible interjection) . . . The member from Quill Lakes 
doesn’t like to hear that. He doesn’t disagree with me, because he 
knows what I’m saying is correct, that the estimates of those 
programs by both parties were . . . you know, they varied during 
the course of the political debate. 
 
So in terms of the take-up on the program, I . . . the program took 
up much more in the first year than we had expected. And the 
reason being that I believe that many people thought that as the 
bidding war, as they called it, went up during the campaign, that 
this may be very short-lived and we better make sure hurried 
decisions and take advantage of programs because of the election 
environment. I say that quite candidly. I think a lot of people made 
those decisions. And as a consequence, certainly, the expenditures 
came in, in the first year, higher than we had expected. 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Minister, you are saying, I take it — I 
didn’t hear much relevant to the question that I asked — but I take 
it you’re saying that that also took you by surprise, the amount of 
money for the home program, and that the amount of advertising 
that was done for it wasn’t expected to produce that substantial 
expenditure. Fair enough, just another little shortfall in the 
estimate. 
 
Now, Mr. Minister, I want to ask you this, because I didn’t 
understand your March statement. You told us in your March 
statement that the deficit was currently forecast at $1.2 billion. I 
want to ask you two short questions. Is that still your estimate of 
what the deficit was for the year ended March 31, 1987? And was 
the write-off of Sedco, referred to no page 8, part of that deficit? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — I’m told that it’s going to be about 1.235 and 
that Sedco, on the advice of the auditor, is not 

taken into account. 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Do I understand what you’re saying, that 
you’re telling us that the deficit, some seven months after the 
fiscal year ended, you are now guessing that your deficit may be 
1.235? May I say, Mr. Minister, on any number of years we’ve 
had audited statements dated in September which gave us what not 
only the government but the auditor was prepared to certify was it. 
 
But all right, let’s take your estimate of 1.235 of the deficit for last 
year. Are you now telling me that that does not include the $45 
million write-offs of Sedco, the forest products corporation, and 
Sask Transportation Company? That those are not included in the 
1.235, and if we added that, then the deficit would be $45 million 
larger than that? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — I’m advised that we’re not aware of any 
financial statements at September to which the hon. member 
refers. And on the advice, I gather, of the auditors, that it was 
subsequently recommended that it be written off against the 
cumulative deficit as opposed to the operating deficit. 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — We’re to add that to the deficit — to the 
overall deficit, but not the deficit for the year? So if we want to 
find out how much we fell behind, it was not only the 1.235 
calculated for last year but it is another 45 million which is clearly 
a loss according to the Minister, but which he didn’t say was lost 
last year, was just lost some time. 
 
And then I want to know about this $110 million of the production 
loan program, this write-off. Now, Mr. Minister, you will be aware 
that there is no production loan program in the Consolidated Fund 
or in the Heritage Fund. How did you write off this $110 million? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — We paid to the ag credit corporation a grant 
for that amount. 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Minister, that is 
the nub of the issue I want to raise. One of your corporations, the 
ag credit corporation, lost some money on production loans, or at 
least wants to reserve against potential losses. To the, you either 
. . . I don’t know how you paid a grant. You reserved, I suspect . . . 
you didn’t hand over that money to the agricultural credit 
corporation, I’m sure of that. You set up a reserve saying you may 
not get your money back from the ag credit corporation. Is not that 
true? And if this is so, how did that become part of the deficit? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lane: — The statute for the ag credit corporation 
specifically requires that if they have either a loan loss or, you 
know, provision for loan loss, we have to make that payment. 
 
Mr. Chairman: — Order, please. It being 12 o’clock, the 
committee will rise and report progress. 
 
The committee reported progress. 
 
The Assembly recessed until 2 p.m.
