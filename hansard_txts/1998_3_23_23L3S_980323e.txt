INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 

Ms. Lorje: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Earlier this afternoon, 
all members of the legislature were very privileged to be invited 
to a reception hosted by the SCIC, the Saskatchewan Council 
for International Co-operation. And joining us in the gallery, in 
your gallery this evening, Mr. Speaker, are four people who 
were part of that reception and who had wonderful displays to 
really remind us about what happens in most of the world. 
These are people who deal with people on an ongoing basis in 
countries where freedom of speech is a dream — let alone 
freedom of bell ringing as we’re witnessing. 
 
So I would like to, with leave, introduce Major Wally Simpson, 
and Major Ron Trickett from the Salvation Army. They were 
telling me about some of their projects, Mr. Speaker, and in 
particular they have received matching grants through SCIC for 
a women’s training centre in Haiti and a mobile health clinic in 
Ecuador. 
 
As well with the representatives from the Salvation Army are 
two gentlemen. Mr. John Derbowka, is on the board of SCIC 
and also on the Canadian board of the Canadian Hunger 
Foundation. And as well Mr. Jim Zepp is with the Canadian 
Hunger Foundation. They tell me that they have at least a dozen 

projects going at any one time in places like Africa, India, 
Southeast Asia and Central America. 
 
I congratulate all of the people who are involved in SCIC, and I 
thank them very much for their generous gift of time and 
education for all of us here in the legislature. I ask everyone to 
join me in welcoming them. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(1915) 
 
Mr. Whitmore: — With leave, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to 
introduce guests. 
 
Leave granted. 
 
Mr. Whitmore: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too would also 
like to welcome this evening Mr. John Derbowka. Mr. 
Derbowka has been involved in the co-op movement for many 
years. And before I was involved in political life, I was 
involved many years in the co-operative movement. I would 
certainly like to welcome John here tonight too. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear!
