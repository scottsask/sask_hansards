LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 
May 3, 1983 

 
EVENING SESSION 

 
MOTIONS FOR RETURNS (Debatable) 

 
Return No. 7 

 
Mr. Shillington moved, seconded by Mr. Lingenfelter, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return 
no 7 showing: 
 

The name of each individual issued with a vehicle through the Central Vehicle Agency for the 
period May 8, 1982 to March 18, 1983. 
 

Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, just to clean this one up a little, so that we can answer it, and I 
think in a way that we can provide the information that the hon. members opposite want. First, to deal 
with the overlapping of the date from the previous session; and second, because so many vehicles are 
out on a short-term for a specific purpose, it’s almost impossible to pull all that together, and even if we 
had the desire to do it, it would take more paper than we could carry in here. So I amend the motion by 
. . . yeah, okay . . . We’ll amend the motion to read as follows: 
 

The name of each individual issued with an executive vehicle through the Central Vehicle 
Agency for the period November 27, ’82 to March 18, ’83. 
 

I move, seconded by the Minister of Health. 
 
Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 8 
 

Mr. Koskie moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 8 
showing: 
 

With respect to the purchase of motor vehicles for the use and benefit of the Premier: (1) the 
guide-lines respecting the make, model and cost of motor vehicle which the Premier may select 
for his use; (2) the length of time or service such motor vehicle is kept before being traded in or 
disposed of; (3) whether or not such guide-lines have changed since May 8, 1982 and if so the 
nature of such changes. 
 

Motion agreed to. 
 

Return No. 9 
 

Mr. Koskie moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 9 
showing: 
 

For the period May 8, 1982 to March 18, 1983: (1) the name of each individual hired under 
contract by all departments, crown corporations and  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1720 

agencies of the Government of Saskatchewan; (2) the salary being paid to each individual; (3) 
the length of the contract of each individual. 
 

Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I’m going to urge all members of the House to vote this motion 
down. The negative request comes out of my view as to the type of information being asked here. 
Contracts often are not handled by the personnel department, and it’s therefore difficult to pull them 
together. But in addition to that, I would ask the hon. member to go to item 70 – I think it’s item 70 – 
where you’re asking for this information department by department. So I would vote this one down. I’m 
going to ask all members to vote negative to this, Mr. Speaker, and we will deal with them department 
by department, which also may be negatived. But we’ll deal with them when we get there, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Motion negatived. 
 

Return No. 10 
 

Mr. Koskie moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 10 
showing: 
 

Regarding the purchase of new vehicles: (1) the total number purchased by the central vehicle 
agency for the period May 8, 1982 to March 18, 1983; (2) the name and location of the car 
dealership from which each one was purchased. 
 

Mr. Koskie: — I would hope that the minister would not amend this one. 
 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I’m going to amend this one to provide, I think, the information 
that the members opposite, in fact, want. The amendment will in effect exclude such things as dump 
trucks, vehicles purchased on behalf of Sask Power and Sask Tel, etc. And I therefore move, seconded 
by the member for Regina North, that motion for return no. 10 be amended to read as follows: 
 

Regarding the purchase of new executive vehicles: (1) the total number purchased by the 
central vehicle agency for the period May 8, 1982 to March 18, 1983 (and that takes care of the 
overlap that you people had forgotten about since the last session); (2) the name and location of 
the car dealership from which each was purchased. 
 

Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 11 
 

Mr. Koskie moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 11 
showing: 
 

With respect to the use of law firms: (1) for the period May 8, 1982 to March 18, 1983 the 
name of each law firm that has received remuneration from any department, crown corporation 
and agency of the Government of Saskatchewan; (2) the amount received by each firm. 



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1721 

Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, this amendment is simply to eliminate the overlap caused by the 
members opposite forgetting that they asked for this return in the last session, as well. So we are 
amending it, seconded by the member for Regina North, that the motion for return no. 11 be amended by 
striking out the words ‘May 8, 1983’ and substituting: 
 

November 27, 1983. 
 

So, in fact, what we’re doing is we’re giving you more than you asked for. 
 
Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 12 
 

Mr. Koskie moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 12 
showing: 
 

For the period May 8, 1982 to March 18, 1983: (1) the number of new positions created in each 
department, crown corporation and agency of the Government of Saskatchewan; (2) the title of 
each position; (3) the name of the individual appointed to each position; (4) the salary paid to 
each individual. 
 

Hon. Mr. Berntson: — This amendment will do a couple of things. Firstly, it will exclude the 
information that is covered in return no. 11 from the previous session, which is being put together at this 
time and will not be ready for about another four weeks, because it’s just a massive volume that you’ve 
asked for; and secondly, to deal specifically with permanent position. So I move, seconded by the 
member for Regina North, that the motion for return no. 12 be amended to read as follows: 
 

For the period November 27, 1982 to March 18, 1983: (1) the number of new permanent 
positions created in each department, crown corporation and agency of the Government of 
Saskatchewan; (2) the title of each position; (3) the name of the individual appointed to each 
position; (4) the salary paid to each individual. 
 

Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 13 
 

Mr. Koskie moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 13 
showing: 
 

For the period May 8, 1982 to March 18, 1983, the name and position of each individual in every 
department, crown corporation and agency of the Government of Saskatchewan whose 
employment has been terminated. 
 

Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I’m going to ask all members to vote this  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1722 

resolution down, as well. And, if the members opposite would care to come in with a more specific 
definition of termination, chances are we could get the information, but I’m told that computer records 
show as being terminated all those who: retire, die, are dismissed for cause, are laid off, are on disability 
income plan, or resign. So if you would care to be more specific as it relates to termination, there’s some 
way that we can pull the information together for you through another resolution . . . Mr. Speaker, since 
my book is under lock and key, not available to the general public, I would ask that all members vote 
against this resolution. 
 
Motion negatived.

that return no. 37 through to return no. 41 will all be the subject of the said amendment. And if that is 
the case, then why don’t we just skip reading it and just read the introduction and move it without 
reading it? 
 
While the Clerk’s having a go at that, I’ll move, seconded by Mr. Lingenfelter, that an order for the 
Assembly do issue for return no. 37 showing:

March 24, 1983; (3) the duties and responsibilities of the position; and (4) the experience and

I’m trying to – I just don’t think the House Leader is going to make it if we don’t take pity on him. I 
know he’s competent but he’s human. 
 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the Minister of Health, that the motion for 
return no. 37 – we may do this on the next one when we find out whether we can do it or not – be 
amended by removing all the words after the words ‘March 24, 1983; (3),’ and substituting therefor the

no. 9 asked for, and quite frankly, each subdivision in departments would have to search the records to 
obtain this information, and there’s no guarantee as to the precision or the accuracy of the records. The 
method of record keeping, I point out, Mr. Speaker, has been established long before this administration 
took office. And had the last administration been asked these questions, Mr. Speaker, and I’m sure they 
were, they would have had the same problems. It’s virtually impossible to pull it together, and I would 
therefore, urge all members to negative this question.

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Speaker, the order requests that the Department of the Executive Council 
advise this House or give to this House the information of people that it has hired under written contract, 
at an amount of more than $1,000 per month. Now, clearly there are not going to be many people who 
are hired under a written contract that provide for $1,000 a month, or more. 
 
This does not deal with the matter of casual employees. Casual employees are highly unlikely to get 
$1,000 a month. It does not deal with regular employees. Regular employees are not hired under written 
contracts, and I venture to think that there will not be more than one or two people in the Government of 
Saskatchewan who might be called regular employees who would have been hired under anything called 
a written contract. In fact, they are appointed pursuant to the provisions of The Public Service Act, and 
for the most part, for the great overwhelming majority of cases, there will be no written contract, as 
such. 
 
What we are dealing with are contract employees – the new variation of employee introduced by this 
government, in great numbers I may say, in great numbers I may say, who are in many cases doing the 
regular work of government employees. I think this will be the first time that I’m aware of in this 
legislature that a minister of the Crown has come in and had sitting beside him, offering him advice in 
answer to questions, a person who was not a regular employee, but someone who was on a contract of 
employment. This happened during the last session when the Premier was here with the estimates of the 
Executive Council. And, when you look at the list of regular employees, the person who was sitting 
beside him was not a regular employee, but a person on a written contract of employment. 
 
Now, the information which is requested here will by and large be information published with respect to 
regular employees and in the Public Accounts. 
 
It ought to be available with respect to these contract employees just as surely as it is available with 
respect to regular employees. I can understand why the members opposite . . . The House Leader may 
not wish to disclose the fact that someone is getting $400 a day, but the mere fact that he doesn’t wish to 
disclose the fact that someone is getting $400 a day or more is no reason why he should deny that 
information to the public. Now, this is what is asked on this question. We’re asking whether people are 
hired at $410 a day or more; the name of each person whose  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1746 

services were retained after May 1st, 1982 under a written contract under which such person was paid or 
entitled to get $1,000 a month or more; and the date and the amount and terms and conditions and the 
experience and the duties. 
 
Those are pretty reasonable questions to be asked – pretty reasonable for the public to have a right to 
know what the qualifications and duties are of someone who is getting $400 a day or more and pretty 
unreasonable for the government to say that they will not disclose that information – pretty 
unreasonable. 
 
I can think of no effective answers to the assertion that the public has a right to know the qualifications, 
the experience, and what job is being done when $400 a day of their money is being paid out to an 
individual. And we know that’s true; we know that other people are getting $350 a day. I think the 
public has a right to know what these people are doing and why they merit payments of that amount. 
And if in fact the government has nothing to apologize for, if in fact payments of this amount are 
merited, then surely they will not resist giving this information to the press and to the public. But if in 
fact these payments are not merited, if in fact they’re being paid to people who have no just cause, just 
claim, to get that kind of money, then I would expect that the government opposite may well vote 
against this motion. 
 
There can be no other reason for voting against it. I am referring now to the Executive Council. There 
are no thousands of employees in the Executive Council. I trust that there would be not more than 150 
people all in, in the Executive Council, if that. There would be no great difficulty to run down the list to 
see which were regular employees and which were employed under contracts of employment. No 
difficulty at all, Mr. Speaker. And if the government doesn’t accept this motion, it will be not because 
there is any difficulty in getting the information, but because they decline to disclose the information. 
There can be no other explanation. If there was some small defect in the wording, according to them, 
they certainly would have moved the amendment. They have not been reticent in moving amendments 
with respect to other motions. But that is not done here. 
 
We’re talking, Mr. Speaker, about people who are hired in the office of the Executive Council, that’s the 
Premier’s office, and we are talking about people who are getting in some cases very large sums of 
money, at a rate of $100,000 a year. And we’re asking what they’re doing for $100,000 a year. We’re 
asking what they’re doing for $75,000 or $80,000 a year. I would be interested in knowing whether the 
government opposite is refusing to tell us what these people are doing for $75,000 or $80,000 or 
$100,000 a year. 
 
If they vote against this, we will know that they’re saying, not only to us, because whether or not we 
know is not of any particular moment, but whether or not the public of Saskatchewan have a right to 
know is a very considerable moment . . . And that’s what we’re here for. We’re here to ask, on behalf of 
the public, for information they have a right to know. And it is my assertion, Mr. Speaker, that the public 
have the right to know and I’m going to call upon the government to support this motion, and to give to 
us and to this legislature and to the public information on contract employees, not people who are 
getting trifling sums of money, but getting $1,000 a month or more – what qualifications they have, 
what duties they perform, and what salary they get, what payments they get from the public purse. I 
think it is a reasonable request. I ask the government to support it. 
 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Well, Mr. Speaker, whether or not the request is reasonable,  



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1747 

the position that we have taken is that we’re going to vote against this particular resolution. I can 
remember full well when I was on that side of the House and you were on this side of the House, 
advancing the same arguments that we are advancing here today. I can remember full well that, for 
instance, when we were asking for names and qualifications of people under contract to the previous 
administration, that all of the arguments that we advance were advanced then. For instance, you were 
somewhat reluctant, or the previous minister of agriculture was somewhat reluctant to indicate to this 
House that one Roy Atkinson was acting under contract to his department for a $26,000 fee annually. 
I’m not suggesting for a moment that those kinds of contracts exist in this particular government. Some 
may, some may not. I’m not familiar with all the departments. I can tell you they don’t exist in my 
department. 
 
I wonder why the Leader of the Opposition is asking us on this particular motion to duplicate what he 
already has. He got it in estimates of Executive Council the last session and I understand it was tabled. 
He was quoting from it in question period today, as I recall. So quite simply I’m asking all members to 
negative this motion.

Return No. 89 
 

Mr. Koskie moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 89 
showing: 
 

(1) The name of each person whose services were retained after May 1, 1982 under a written 
contract under which such person was paid or entitled to be paid an amount of $1,000 per 
month or more by or with the Saskatchewan Liquor Board; (2) the date on which each

each contract; (4) the experience and qualifications of each person retained under contract; 
(5) the duties of each person retained under contract; (6) a copy of each written contract. 

 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Speaker, I won’t detain the House long except to say that what is requested 
here is a list of the people who the liquor board is hiring under contract and paying more than $1,000 a 
month. I’m very surprised if the government would take the position that they will not tell this House 
who the liquor board is hiring under contracts of $1,000 a month or more, which is in the instance of 
being a regular employee and if not, I can only assume that the liquor board is being used as a place to 
hire people and pay people who the government does not wish to disclose, to pay them sums of money, 
to bury the people who are friends of the Progressive Conservative Party whose names and duties and 
salaries and payments the government does not wish to disclose. 
 
I think it will be known that the new chairman of the liquor board is the former leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party in Saskatchewan and he may well be qualified, but I think it’s particularly 
unfortunate when the government opposite appoints the former leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party as chairman of the liquor board, authorizes him to hire people under contract, and then declines to 
disclose in this House even the names of the people hired under contract, and certainly declines to say 
what they are paid, what their duties are, or what their qualifications are. 



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1749 

If the public views that with some scepticism, if the public views the story of the House Leader saying 
that it’s going to be a terrible job to find all these names, if they view that story with some scepticism, I 
think we can think that the public was right and the House Leader is wrong. And certainly under these 
circumstances, particularly when they have made this appointment of a person close to their party as 
chairman, when the previous chairmen for certainly 30 years had been without party allegiance. And if 
anyone doubts that, I invite anyone to review that and to indicate what conceivable party allegiance any 
of the previous chairmen had. 
 
And having changed that precedent going back to 30 years, and having then authorized – as undoubtedly 
he does have the authority – to engage people under contract, and then having refused to disclose to this 
House the names of the people who he has hired by this clandestine method, because it does not show up 
in Public Accounts as they will with ordinary government departments, then I think we can readily 
understand why the public will be sceptical about any denials on the part of the government that there is 
nothing wrong with this procedure. And I regret to say that the government, in my judgement, is 
embarked upon an entirely wrong course of action. I invite them to reconsider at least with respect to the 
liquor board and the employees which are hired by the new chairman of the liquor board under contract 
– not under regular procedure, not under the union contract – but under this method by which of contract 
by which no disclosure is provided for. 
 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I have very quickly reconsidered and the answer is still no. I say, 
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition makes some suggestion that the chairman of the liquor board 
has a party affiliation and I don’t think there is any doubt that the chairman of the liquor board has a 
party affiliation, as does the agent-general to London have a party affiliation, so do a few others around 
the province have a party affiliation. I can think of others that have a party affiliation with the previous 
administration. I can think of candidates, for instance, from the last election that work in the Department 
of Co-ops. I can think of all kinds, and a few SGI agents that used to sit in this House. 
 
You know I just wouldn’t get too excited about party affiliation. When you start to question his 
competence and his credentials, I don’t think there should be any question there and quite frankly from 
where I sit, and I don’t call the shots over here, but if I did, everything being equal, I would go with one 
of my party affiliation before I would go with one of yours. And there can be no question about that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there are several forums to get the information that the members opposite are asking for. 
One is during estimates in this House. We would be dealing with the estimates of Health, if we could get 
through these resolutions, at which time you could ask for the people employed in that particular 
department or whatever. The arguments that we advanced for resolution no. 9 and resolution no. 70, and 
so on, they are general, but valid, and we’re treating all the resolutions in a similar nature. If the minister 
for whatever departments wants to give you that information, I’ve no objection to him giving it to you. 
You will have your opportunity to question the minister responsible for the liquor board during 
estimates as you will have the opportunity to question the Minister of Health this evening. Quite simply, 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge all members to vote against this resolution.

Return No. 92 
 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney moved, seconded by Mr. Thompson, that an order of the Assembly do issue for 
return no. 92 showing: 
 

(1) The total dollar amount paid by the Department of Executive Council during the period May 
8, 1982 to April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for air fares; (2) the name of each individual 
for whom air fare has been paid and the amount for each individual. 

 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — This, Mr. Speaker, asks for the total dollar amount paid by the Department of 
Executive Council for the period since May 8, to April 12, to commercial airlines for air fares, and the 
name of the individual for whom the air fare has been paid. It’s a fairly simply and straightforward 
request for information. 
 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — A couple of simple amendments to set the dates out so there’s no overlap 
between this and the previous order from the last session, and secondly, to limit air fares to those for 
paid employees, as opposed to those who would be in a trustee relationship as a ward to a minister or 
something like that. 
 
I move, seconded by the Minister of Education, that motion for return no. 92 be amended to read as 
follows: 
 

The total dollar amount paid by the Department of Executive Council during the period 
November 27, 1982 to April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for employee air fares; the name of 
each employee for whom air fare has been paid and the amount for each individual. 
 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against the amendment, and the amendment cannot 
possibly be justified. What we have here is the Department of the Executive Council and what we’re 
asking is: for whom are they paying air fares? And we know the way that the Department of Executive 
Council operates. A large number of its employees are contract employees, and apparently not regular 
employees. 
 
So we have one group, who they will not tell us about air fares, about the Mr. Leiers and the Mr. 
Livingstones, and all of these people who not only had the good fortune to get  



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1751 

$410 a day, but apparently had the good fortune to get air fares paid for them which are undisclosed by 
the government opposite. There’s that group of people who are contract people, who are not employees 
and who the government is refusing to say how much they’re paying for air fares. 
 
There’s another group of people, I assume the president of the Progressive Conservative Party, if he 
goes somewhere with the Premier, his air fare can be paid and the government opposite declines to 
disclose that. 
 
It is suggested to me, Mr. Speaker, that I am being ridiculous. Can anyone think of any reason why 
people who had their air fare paid by the Executive Council should not have that fact disclosed in this 
House? Does the Minister of Agriculture suggest that anybody flies under the expense of the Executive 
Council, who is a ward of the Government of Saskatchewan, or is in some other trustee relationship? I 
say that is ridiculous. I say that is ridiculous. I say that this House has a right to know for whom air fares 
are paid. If we have a right to know how much air fare is paid for an employee, we have a greater right 
to know how much air fare is paid for a non-employee. 
 
It is in the ordinary course of the operation of a government to pay for air fares for employees. It is not 
in the ordinary course of operations of a government to pay for air fares for non-employees – for 
non-employees. I don’t suggest that it’s always improper. Certainly it is not. The Premier may well take 
people to a conference who are not employees of the government, and it’s entirely proper to pay air 
fares. But this should be disclosed. 
 
The previous government certainly took distinguished citizens to conferences on the constitution – 
representatives of the Francophone community, or the native community, or SARM (Saskatchewan 
Association of Rural Municipalities), or SUMA (Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association), and 
those air fares were paid, and the amounts were disclosed. There’s no reason: (a) why they shouldn’t be 
paid; but (b) why they shouldn’t be disclosed. 
 
I think that this . . . we come to the nub of the matter of whether or not we’re dealing with a government 
which wants to make known facts about its administration or wants to cover up facts about its 
administration. And when one thinks about why they wouldn’t want to disclose what air fares were paid 
by the Premier’s office, one can think of a number of explanations, some of which do no credit to the 
government opposite. And no explanation has been given as to why you will not disclose, Mr. Minister, 
the costs that are being borne by the taxpayers for people who aren’t employees of the government. 
 
We have a good number of citizens who would like to have their air fare paid by the government, but 
they have to pay their taxes and they’re not getting their air fare paid by the government. They would 
like to know, and have every right to know, whether other citizens are getting their air fares paid for by 
the government, and under what aegis, whether, when people go to conferences of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, whether they’re at Winnipeg or Ottawa, they’re getting air fares paid. Maybe not, 
maybe not. But why not disclose that fact? What is hidden? What is hidden about air fares paid by the 
Executive Council for people who are not employees? No argument can be advanced that has any logic, 
and a great number of arguments can be advanced which do no credit to the government opposite. 
 
It is suggested that this may be obtained in estimates. This is not only available to  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1752 

members of this House. Estimates are not the only forum, indeed they’re not the best forum for detailed 
information. The best forum for getting detailed information about lists of bills that have been paid, 
amounts of money that have been paid, are most certainly orders for return. This has been done 
universally in the past, and in other legislatures, and certainly estimates is not the place. However, if the 
Deputy Premier is giving me the undertaking of his government, that when we ask this question in 
estimates, we’ll get the answer, then that’s another matter, but I don’t think he is. I think he’s just saying 
that we will refuse it there as we will refuse it here. 
 
And I think, Mr. Speaker, that it bodes ill for the people of Saskatchewan, when a government opposite 
will not disclose whose air fares they’re paying. Just won’t disclose it. Says it’s none of the public’s 
business. Sure it’s the public’s money, but it’s none of the public’s business and as for why, no 
explanation – just we are the government, we’re spending your money, and you have no right to know 
where. That is the position taken by the minister. It’s a wrong position. It’s one which he ought to 
abandon and I invite him now to abandon that position, and either to withdraw his amendment or to fail 
to support it. 
 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I . . . 
 
Mr. Speaker: — I’m sorry, I’ve missed you speaking twice.

Return No. 95 
 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return 
no. 95 showing: 
 

(1) The name of each person whose services were retained after May 1, 1982 under a written 
contract under which such person was paid or entitled to be paid an amount of $1,000 per 
month or more by or with the crown investments corporation; (2) the date on which each 
written contract was entered into; (3) the amount, terms and conditions of remuneration for 
each contract; (4) the experience and qualifications of each person retained under contract; 
(5) the duties of each person retained under contract; (6) a copy of each written contract. 

 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Speaker, this is done in the same form as otherwise. I think there is 
considerable indication that some people have been employed by the crown investments corporation 
under contract. There are a number of people who appear to be in a contractual relationship with the 
crown investments corporation. 
 
The crown investments corporation is a relatively small organization, perhaps 30 or 40 employees all in. 
It will not be very difficult to find the two, or three, or four, or five, who are in some contractual 
relationship with the crown investments corporation, and who might be earning $1,000 a month or more. 
It will be a very small group of people. It will represent no amount of work to ascertain who they are and 
to give the information with respect to them. And since the crown investments corporation is a central 
agency, and since there is every evidence that people like Mr. Bruce Flamont have been employed by 
crown investment corporation – considerable interest has been expressed as to what services he was 
performing for the crown investments corporation – I think it would be very helpful, not only to 
members of this House, but to a good number of other people around the province, if this information 
were made available, and I urge all hon. members to accept the motion. 
 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, on this motion, the Leader of the Opposition, of course, is right. 
There are a few, I suspect, on contract to CIC, the central agency for the crowns, and I suppose the 
information could, indeed, be readily available. I’m not aware of what sort of access problems there are 
to the information. If they are as available as he indicates that it might be, I’m sure that the proper course 
of action would be for him to seek out that information at the crown corporations committee. 
 
And not to suggest that it couldn’t be provided here, but this resolution takes the same form as other 
resolutions for other departments that we have denied, and I’m following the same route as some, rather 
than risk providing you with an opportunity to use the argument, ‘Well, you passed this one, why don’t 
you pass the next one?’ 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Speaker, just a word in closing the debate. It will be noted that this asks 
information with respect to the crown investments corporation, which is a crown corporation, and it is 
comparatively difficult to get information with respect to a  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1754 

crown corporation for the calendar year 1983. The crown corporations committee ordinarily does not 
deal with matters after the end of the fiscal year. I am asking for information up to a date more current 
than the end of the last fiscal year. And accordingly, the argument that the information is available in the 
crown corporations committee is not a sound argument. It may well be that the information can be asked 
in estimates; but it may well be also, that it will be resisted in estimates. 
 
Certainly, the minister, on a previous occasion, expressed no particular pleasure at being asked current 
questions on the crown investments corporation in estimates. I invite the Minister of Agriculture to 
speak to his colleague on this and remind his colleague that he has indicated that this information might 
be asked in estimates and we will certainly take advantage of that kind offer by the Minister of 
Agriculture. 
 
Motion negatived.

contract was entered into; (3) the amount, terms and conditions of remuneration for each

duties of each person retained under contract; (6) a copy of each written contract. 

 
Motion negatived.

Hon. Mr. Blakeney moved, seconded by Mr. Lingenfelter, that an order of the Assembly do issue for 
return no. 97 showing: 
 

(1) The name of each person whose services were retained after May 1, 1982 under a written

Motion negatived on division. 
 

Return No. 98 
 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly  



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1755 

do issue for return no. 98 showing: 
 

(1) The total dollar amount paid by the Department of the Provincial Secretary during the period 
May 8, 1982 to April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for air fares; (2) the name of each 
individual for whom air far has been paid and the amount for each individual. 

 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — This motion, Mr. Speaker, asks for amounts paid by the Department of the 
Provincial Secretary, for commercial air fares and the name of each individual for whom the air fare has 
been paid. 
 
And I think it’s worthwhile to note, Mr. Speaker, that in most cases these are in the exact words that 
have been agreed to at the previous session, and I invite all hon. members who may doubt that to look at 
the words that we are now moving and to look at the words which were moved in the previous session, 
and to find out whether or not they are the same. And in this case, I think they’re exactly the same. 
 
I think that providing, which I trust will happen, the information from the previous session caused no 
difficulty for the government, and accordingly I would expect, therefore, that there be no problem with 
respect to providing the same information. If in fact there has been a difficulty, I know that the 
appropriate minister will explain the difficulty which was experienced by the government and the 
reasons why this information, which was agreed to in the last session, is now being denied. 
 
Motion agreed to. 
 

Return No. 99

Hon. Mr. Berntson: — I moved, seconded by the member for Regina North, that the motion for return 
no. 99 be amended to read as follows: 
 

The total dollar amount paid by the Crown Investments Corporation of Saskatchewan during the 
period May 8, 1982 to April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for employee air fares; (2) the name 
of each employee for whom air fare has been paid and the amount for each individual. 
 

And I understand, Mr. Speaker, that the reason for this amendment is to exclude those people who may 
have had transportation paid to come out for interviews for . . . (inaudible) . . . positions, etc. 
 
Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 100 



 
May 3, 1983

no. 100 showing:

April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for air fares; (2) the name of each individual for whom

Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the member for Regina North, that the 
motion for return no. 100 be amended by striking out the words ‘to May 8, 1982’ and substituting: 
 

November 27th, 1982. 
 

That’s just to eliminate overlap between the previous return and this one. 
 
Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 101 
 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney moved, seconded by Mr. Lingenfelter, that an order of the Assembly do issue for

(1) The total dollar amount paid by the Department of Energy and Mines during the period May 
8, 1982 to April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for air fares; (2) the name of each individual 
for whom air fare has been paid and the amount for each individual. 

 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the member for Regina North, that 101 be 
similarly amended by striking out the words ‘May 8, 1982’ and substituting: 
 

November 27, 1982. 
 

Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 102 
 

Mr. Lingenfelter moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 
102 showing: 
 

(1) The name of each person whose services were retained after May 1, 1982 under a written 
contract under which such person was paid or entitled to be paid an amount of $1,000 per 
month or more by or with the Department of Social Services; (2) the date on which each 
written contract was entered into; (3) the amount, terms and conditions of remuneration for

Motion negatived on division. 
 

Return No. 103 
 

Mr. Lingenfelter moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for return no. 
103 showing: 
 

(1) The total dollar amount paid by the Department of Social Services during the period May 8, 
1982 to April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for air fares; (2) the name of each individual, 
excluding the names of recipients of benefits under the Saskatchewan Assistance Plan or like 
programs, for whom an air fare has been paid and the amount paid for each individual. 

 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — I move, seconded by the member for Regina North, that the motion for return 
no. 103 be amended to read as follows: 
 

The total dollar amount paid by the Department of Social Services during the period November 
27, 1982 to April 12, 1983 to commercial airlines for employee air fares; the name of each 
employee for whom the air fare has been paid and the amount paid for each employee. 
 

And the reason again, Mr. Speaker, firstly, to avoid duplication as to overlap of dates, and secondly, to 
exclude all but employee air fares. The other categories would be wards, and people who many fall 
under the Saskatchewan Assistance Plan, and others of confidential nature. 
 
Amendment agreed to. 
 
Motion as amended agreed to. 
 

Return No. 104 
 

Mr. Lingenfelter moved, seconded by Mr. Lusney, that an order of the Assembly do issue for a return

for needy persons, for whom an air fare has been paid and the amount paid for each 
individual. 

 
Hon. Mr. Berntson: — I move, seconded by the member for Regina North, that the motion for return 
no. 104 be amended by striking out the words ‘May 8, 1982’ and substituting: 
 

November 27, 1982.

GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
 

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 
 

CONSOLIDATED FUND BUDGETARY EXPENDITURE 
 

HEALTH 
 

Ordinary Expenditure – Vote 32 
 

Item 1 
 
Mr. Chairman: — Would the minister introduce his officials? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Yes, Mr. Chairman, I’d be very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce my 
officials to the House and the opposition and anyone in the galleries. Beside me is my deputy, Ken Fyke, 
deputy minister of health; to my left, Mr. Peter Glynn, the associate deputy minister of health; sitting 
behind me to the right is George Loewen, associate deputy minister of health; directly behind me is 
Lawrence Krahn, director of administrative services; and in the back row I have Rick Rogers, the 
executive director of the SHSP; Steve Petz, executive director of the continuing care branch; Bob Reid, 
newly appointed assistance deputy minister, and John Yarske, executive director of psychiatric services. 
 
I’d also like to say at this time, I remember my last estimates, Mr. Chairman, where I thanked the rest of 
my staff at the end. But, because of a lot of the trivia and the mundane questions coming from the other 
side, they had left; so I’m not going to run that risk tonight. They’ve been waiting a long time for our 
estimates to start, and I just thank all of you for being here to supply the necessary information, to 
answer the questions that the hon. members on the other side will deservedly ask. So I just would like to 
thank you and we’ll get on with the estimates. 
 
I understand there’s some roaring on the other side, Mr. Chairman. I don’t know what the reason for that 
is, but I’d have a few introductory remarks that I think will lend a little food for thought for the members 
on the other side. And with your indulgence I’d like to start into those. 
 
I just want to say a few words of introduction and then we can get on with the main questioning. I 
suppose, Mr. Chairman, one of the main features of this year’s budget is, of course, the inclusion of 
continuing care and ambulance services into the Department of Health. I think these are both very 
positive moves. Home care, special care homes and all aspects of ambulance service will now be the 
responsibility of just one department and one minister. And that will help us a lot in developing 
programs in a co-ordinated and efficient manner. 



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1760 

As far as the size of the budget is concerned, I want to emphasize that, excluding the effects of 
continuing care and ambulance services, that the budget of the department has risen by $70 million over 
the 1982-83 budget. Mr. Chairman, that’s an increase of 9.6 per cent. And I repeat that’s an increase, 
when you compare apples with apples, of 9.6 per cent. I think it’s a substantial increase in these times of 
tight economic times. 
 
The budget provides concrete evidence, Mr. Chairman, of the government’s commitment to improve 
health care; a commitment, Mr. Chairman, a commitment of $17 million to cancer and the Cancer 
Foundation of Saskatchewan; a commitment, Mr. Chairman, of 700,000 for the expansion of cardiac 
services here in Regina; $650,000 for a new pediatric intensive care unit at the University Hospital in 
Saskatoon; 180 new positions in our hospitals, 180 new positions; funds for 97 new special home care 
beds and $2 million to address urgent needs in the long-term care; and funds to initiate for the first time 
in Saskatchewan a chiropody program that the senior citizens of this province asked that government 
opposite, when they were government, for. In ’75 it was promised; in ’78; in ’83 it will be delivered by 
the government on this side of the House. That is listening to people and delivering programs that 
they’re asking for. These are just a few of the major items. But I think they speak for themselves in 
terms of the priority which the government assigns to health care in this province. 
 
I hear that the fellows are chirping away on the other side, so I would like to entertain any questions that 
they would like to ask regarding health care under the Devine government in Saskatchewan. And at that 
point, Mr. Chairman, I would cease my introductory remarks and invite questions from the members 
opposite. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Chairman, I thank the minister for ending those trivial remarks. As I 
expected, he usually starts out in a very boisterous way, trying to bolster up his ego so he can make it 
through the evening, and we’ve learned to anticipate that, and I don’t suppose we would be surprised. 
And he did mention one program – a new program. At the same time I would like to run through a few 
of the cut-backs that I have noticed in going through the budget. 
 
You will know, Mr. Minister and Mr. Chairman, that the dental plan, for example, has a major cut-back 
since this government came to power. We have seen the four-year-olds cut out of the program. A million 
dollars that had been in the budget last year and this year for four-year-olds is nowhere to be seen. This 
year it’s further cut by not including the 17-year-olds, who many expected to be included in this budget. 
We see staff cuts in the dental care program of 22 people in that program by your own estimates. 
 
Psych services – we see cut-backs in that area. By Ourselves is cut totally – the budget for that group 
which deals with people who have mental problems and who are trying to adjust to the civilian life or 
the street life. The minister has seen fit to cut that funding totally. Women’s health-sharing – I believe 
there is no funding and the minister can correct me if he has changed his mind in that area. And the list 
goes on. 
 
And so to say that you are increasing spending and expanding programs, Mr. Minister, is simply not 
true. You will know that the provincial lab is nowhere to be seen. Hearing aid plan has drastic cut-backs 
in staff. And so for you to stand here and say that your government is committed to health is simply not 
accurate. 



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1761 

What you have done in the reorganization, Mr. Minister, is in a very sinister way taken money out of the 
Department of Northern Saskatchewan and the Department of Social Services, because you couldn’t get 
it out of the Minister of Finance, to carry on your programming. And it’s true that in your estimates the 
total amount that is being spent in Health has increased. But I would like to explain to the taxpayers of 
the province where this money is coming from. It’s not coming from the minister who has gone to 
cabinet and the treasury benches and got money out to expand psych services, or to expand the dental 
plan, or to expand the hearing aid program, or the drug plan; quite the opposite. Where the increase in 
health funding comes from . . . The increase from 728 million to 977 million is in large part coming 
from other departments, the Department of Northern Saskatchewan, and the Department of Social 
Services. And in this way, the minister and the government are attempting to say that they are improving 
health spending to the point that they are number one in Canada. 
 
I say that this is a sinister move by this government in order to use smoked mirrors in order to attempt to 
trick the population of Saskatchewan into believing that they are getting a better health system, when in 
fact what we are seeing is a cut-back in many areas. And I imagine next year if the minister needs more 
help, he may look at the Department of Agriculture and take veterinary services, for example, and 
attempt to say that that is improving the health care in Saskatchewan, when this is what he is doing with 
the Department of Social Services and the Department of Northern Saskatchewan, to attempt to bolster 
his budget. 
 
I would like to ask the minister if he expects the senior citizens, whose responsibility has been shifted to 
his department – the home care area and the nursing homes – whether he expects the benefits for those 
people to be improved; and whether he can tell me whether or not the rates in nursing homes will be 
held, and whether they will get better service for the same amount of money, which I think people 
expect by moving that to Health; or whether it’s simply a smoke-screen to increase your budget and also 
increase nursing home rates. Are you expecting an increase, or not, this coming year? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Well, Mr. Chairman, I listened with interest to the hon. member opposite, and I 
heard him say most distinctly . . . This is what you said, sir, that ‘the minister opened with trivial 
comments.’ Those were your words, correct? That’s what you said, ‘trivial comments.’ Now, Mr. 
Speaker, and members of this Assembly, if you believe that cardiac service to people in Saskatchewan is 
trivia; if you believe that $17 million for cancer is trivia; if you believe that pediatric intensive care is 
trivia; if you believe that 180 nurses at the bedside of sick people in this province is trivia; then I 
challenge you, I challenge you to go out and tell the people of Saskatchewan that, and I hope they heard 
you. I will tell you that I will put those comments of yours around the province, because that’s your 
attitude. 
 
That was your attitude when you were in government, that this was trivia. I told you earlier, the senior 
citizens of this province were promised in ’75 and ’78 a chiropody program. We didn’t promise that in 
the election, but we’re delivering it now. And, I’m very pleased to hear you lead off, to lead off with 
saying that the treatment of cancer, the treatment of open-heart surgery, the intensive care of young 
people, is trivial, because those were your words, and you’ll live to remember those words – trivia. 
 
All right, now you started talking about psychiatric services. I want to correct the record a bit, Mr. 
Chairman. I just want to tell you about the attitude that the government opposite had towards . . . 
psychiatric services in this province. I will go back to 1976,  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1762 

where there were 43 positions deleted, 30 of which were in nursing; 1979, 35 positions deleted, 21 of 
them in nursing; and in 1983 there have been 28 positions deleted, 4 in nursing. Now you tell me, Mr. 
Chairman, which government has the concern for the people. There is your record, try and dispute it. I 
wanted . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Well, I think we’d better compare them because this is just what 
the people are getting now, is good health care service. 
 
And I wanted . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Well, do you want me to repeat it again? I know you may 
need the hearing aid plan, but I’ll go right through these again if you didn’t get them that time: 43 in 
1976 – now listen closely this time – 43 positions deleted . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . I’m coming to 
what we’re doing . . . 30 of which were nursing; in 1979, 35 positions deleted, 21 were nursing; 1983, 28 
positions deleted, 4 of them were nursing. 
 
Now you made some reference in your opening remarks that the increase in the budget was because of 
the amalgamation. I want to go again and remind you – 9.6 per cent, 9.6 per cent, without any 
amalgamation of the ambulance or the special care. 9.6 per cent in the Department of Health and I 
challenge you to tell me another province in Canada; you cite another province in Canada tonight, sir, 
that gave that type of improvement to health care. You can’t. I’ll ask you to do that. 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — My question to the minister was whether or not you expect nursing home rates to 
be increased this year. Here again, we see the showboat grandstanding and a failure to answer the 
question. What I asked is whether or not you are guaranteeing the senior citizens tonight that they will 
not see an increase in nursing home rates as a result of the shift from Social Service to Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — I would just like to keep going through some of these things that you’ve asked 
questions about. We’ll get to the senior citizens . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Oh no, I’ll answer any 
question you can ask, and probably answer them in a way that you won’t be wanting to be asking too 
many more. 
 
I want to tell you, in psych services, since taking office, the government has approved programs for 
improved crisis intervention and short-term supervised accommodation for difficult-to-handle patients in 
both Regina and Saskatoon. And you can’t tell me that that situation developed since April. That was a 
situation that was around for the past 11 years and totally ignored by the government that was in 
previous to the Devine government. 
 
Let’s say with the Health estimates - $200,000 for dealing with people in crisis. Right there . . . 
(inaudible interjection) . . . Well, I would think it certainly is something that has to be addressed. That is 
the difference between our government and yours. You know what your philosophy was? I told some of 
my department one day, and they thought it was very apropos: I call it the milk-pail philosophy and I 
grew up where you fed calves. But you fed that calf, you didn’t take the pail out and throw it around and 
hope some of the milk landed on somebody. That’s how they were. We charted our dollars, we go out 
and hear where the needs are. The milk-pail philosophy of the NDP – because that’s just what it was – 
throw her out and hope somebody gets some splash on them. We go out and we listen to people, and we 
target the dollars. And we target the dollars to cancer and to senior citizens and to psych services and 
delivering the services that the people of Saskatchewan are asking for. And that’s the difference. 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — I can see . . . The minister should know that the leadership race  



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1763 

is over for a while, and he should get down to running the department. 
 
But my question, for the third time, is this, Mr. Minister, for the third time is whether or not you will 
guarantee tonight that senior citizens in nursing homes will not be expecting an increase in rates as a 
result of the shift from the Department of Social Services to the Department of Health. I ask you for the 
third time, and I’m going to keep asking you until you answer it, because it’s obvious that you are not 
about to answer the question. 
 
You want to talk about everything else – milk pails and cows – but you don’t want to tell me whether or 
not nursing home rates will not go up this year. And that’s the question. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Well, you know I think one of the things we want to look at in concern, in a 
compassionate concern for our senior citizens, is how many dollars they would have left of their 
disposable income . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . No. If you’d just wait a minute. I will answer your 
question for you. 
 
I remember when you were the minister of social services, and I remember you bringing in a fee of $390 
. . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Yes, 390. And you know how much that left the senior citizen of his 
disposable income? $50. On April 1, ’83 it was raised to $417, but you know how much was left in the 
pocket of the senior citizen? $117. 
 
Now, which government were most concerned about the expenditures allowed for the senior citizen to 
keep, so that that person could buy some gifts for his granddaughter on her birthday? Perhaps he wants 
to go down and buy some treats. Those are the kind of things that are important to the senior citizen, and 
this government is allowing them to stay in accommodations, looked after, and having more than twice 
the amount of disposable income that you did. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — I wonder if the minister could answer the question – whether or not we will see 
nursing home rates increase this year or not. I am sure that your compassion for the seniors and your 
government by cutting back on the Saskatchewan Income Plan, by cutting back in the hearing aid 
program, by cutting back in the Senior Citizens’ Provincial Council – and the list goes on – will be well 
known in the province by now. 
 
But the question to you, Mr. Minister, that you’re skirting around and trying to avoid, is whether or not 
we can expect an increase for nursing home rates this year, or whether you are expecting them to remain 
the same at $417, which you raised them to last year. Will they be increasing, or will they be staying the 
same? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Mr. Chairman, I can’t say with any degree of certainty whether the rates shall 
remain the same or whether the rates will increase and when that may be. I can’t say at this point in 
time. That’s a hypothetical question. But I can assure you this, and our track record proves it, that if the 
rates are to increase there will be adequate consideration taken of the disposable income that the senior 
citizen can retain. And I think that’s the level and that’s the concern that they want to see. 
 
And I’ve indicated to you from July 1st, ’81, when you increased the 390 and left them  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1764 

$50 . . . Under this government they’ve had $117 left in their pockets, and that consideration will be 
taken into view in this year. 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Minister, can you tell me where the increased revenue came from that you’re 
talking about? The increased money that people have in their pockets today – where did that come from? 
Did it come from the provincial government, or did it come from the federal government? That’s my 
question to you. Because what you are doing every time you raise the nursing home rates is taking 
money that the federal government has given to the seniors in nursing homes and you take it by raising 
nursing home rates. And I think that that is an unfair and an unjust way for you as the minister of a 
department in Saskatchewan to treat the senior citizen. That each time that the federal government raises 
the amount that a senior gets through whatever plan that it might be, that you then come with your 
greedy little hands as Minister of Health and take a part of that away that the federal government has 
given to them. Now the federal government in this country is bad enough in its treatment of people, but 
you, Mr. Minister, are worse. You come there after the meagre amount that the federal government gives 
to the seniors and have your hand out. 
 
And in planning your budget for this year, you cannot tell me that you didn’t know whether or not there 
would be an increase in nursing home rates. Because very obviously, when you’re planning a budget for 
a Department of Health, you would know whether or not there is an increase in nursing home rates 
expected. 
 
And I would like you to tell me now, whether or not you deny that there will be an increase in nursing 
home rates, because that’s what people are beginning to expect of this government, and if you are not 
going to increase them, then I would like you to deny it. Because failing to deny it will confirm our 
worst suspicion: that is that you are intending to take the money that the federal government is paying to 
seniors and keep it for yourself and your government, who are very willing to cut the royalties for oil 
companies, but at the same time are very quick to raise nursing home rates for the seniors in the 
province. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Mr. Chairman, I think the member asked me previously where the money came 
from. It comes from the old age security plan and the guaranteed income supplement and from the 
Saskatchewan Income Plan. That’s where the moneys come for these people. 
 
You’re indicating, what have we done – that we haven’t done anything for seniors. Well, I want to tell 
you that there’s been an increased funding in nursing homes for construction and renovation allowing 
for 11 million in two years - $11 million in two years compared to $7.25 million in seven years under 
the NDP government. Now who is doing something for the senior citizens? I’d ask that question. Eleven 
million in two years with this government; 7.25 million in seven years under your administration. A 
hundred new nursing beds, and 83 replacement beds to be started in 1983-84. Income interest retention 
policy and surface retention policy for these homes so that they can keep the interest that they have to 
better supply services to the senior citizens. 
 
You asked about the question about a rate increase – I told you I couldn’t say with any degree of 
certainty that I gave . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . No, that does not . . . You know, you would try and 
read . . . You know, your logic escapes many in here, but I told you we would take into consideration the 
amount of disposable income that those seniors have, and I can tell you from our past record, we’ve 
done a heck of a lot better than you have and we will continue to do that. 



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1765 

Mr. Lingenfelter: — The minister’s failure to deny that there’s going to be a nursing home rate will 
raise the spectre for all people in the province that there is one to be coming after the session is over. 
And I think this is a very inappropriate way for the minister to be acting, where he denies information to 
the opposition and the people of the province about rate increases, waits till the session is over, and then 
I believe will be announcing a rate increase when there isn’t the opportunity to ask questions of the 
minister in the House. 
 
But, getting back to where the seniors get their money from . . . Can you tell me whether or not since the 
last increase in nursing home rates, whether the provincial government, through the Saskatchewan 
Income Plan, has increased the amount of money that individual seniors can get in the province of 
Saskatchewan? You’re saying you’re going to raise the rates for nursing homes based on the disposable 
income. Can you guarantee to me that if you do not raise the Saskatchewan Income Plan which would 
give them more money from the provincial government, that you will not raise the nursing home rates? 
Will you give the people of the province that guarantee and can you tell me whether or not there has 
been a rate increase in the Saskatchewan Income Plan, seeing as you referred to it? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — There has not been an increase in the Saskatchewan Income Plan. No, there 
hasn’t. And secondly, I think you were trying to put out some fears that there would be an increase 
immediately the House closes. There will not be an increase immediately the House closes. Does that 
answer your question? And I said to you further, I can’t guarantee that there won’t be increases down 
the road. Certainly I can’t. I told you that earlier. I can guarantee you there won’t be one immediately 
the House closes. The spectre you’re trying to put out there in the minds of people – trying to mislead 
again – typical, typical tactic from your side of the House. Well . . . 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — Okay, the minister has established that his government is giving no more money 
to senior citizens through the Saskatchewan Income Plan, which he attempted to put the illusion out 
there that as he gave more money to the senior citizens, the nursing home rates would be increased. 
 
But, it’s interesting to find that there was no increase in the Saskatchewan Income Plan, even though 
inflation is running at 8 or 9 per cent. Senior citizens got no more money, got no more money from this 
provincial government, and any increase that they got or obtained was from the federal government. 
And you, Mr. Minister, now think that it’s your responsibility to go to the nursing homes, check the 
account books of the senior citizens there. If they have a little bit of extra money left, you will then 
decide whether or not you will take that money and decide how much you will leave for them to have to 
buy gifts or whatever it is that they might need at that time. 
 
But what I’m trying to tell the people of the province today is that the Minister of Health is unwilling to 
deny that after the session closes, and we leave here, that he will not be increasing nursing home rates, 
and he will not give that assurance to this Assembly and to the people of the province. Therefore, I think 
that it’s fair to say that in planning his budget he did take into consideration nursing home rate increases, 
and I would like you to answer me whether or not that is not the case, whether in planning your budget, 
you discussed, and actively considered, and have now agreed, to increasing nursing home rates as part of 
your budget discussions that took place. I want you to answer that very carefully, because I think that 
you did take that into consideration, and have agreed as part of your budget structure to increase nursing 
home rates, even though your  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1766 

government has failed to increase the Saskatchewan Income Plan. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Again, you attempt to mislead and distort the facts. I said there had not been an 
increase in the Saskatchewan Income Plan – you immediately say that there will be no increase. You 
know very well that I am not responsible for Saskatchewan Income Plan. You should have asked the 
other minister last night, but I imagine you forgot, not knowing where it was, although you were the 
minister at one time, but you probably missed up on that. 
 
You asked me, did I take into consideration an increase in fees for residents in striking the budget? I will 
tell you emphatically, I did not. You say that there were not considerations given to senior citizens – 
again, I can remind you of the 11 million for the construction of special care homes. If that isn’t for 
senior citizens – the majority of the people in there are senior citizens - $500,000 for new pilot projects 
in small hospitals. Such things as well-elderly clinics . . . We’re asking for pilots to come in from the 
small hospitals, how they can give outreach services to senior citizens. To me, that is services to senior 
citizens. 
 
And, once again, let me remind you of the chiropody program. I know it’s an albatross around your 
neck. You people promised it, played with the seniors two times. We delivered it; we will deliver it for 
them. So I take exception to you saying that we do not take into consideration the needs of the senior 
citizens of Saskatchewan. I think, in a very short period of time since we have become government, that 
the senior citizens of this province, their health care needs, have been addressed in a more forward and 
straightforward manner, than they were in the last 10 years. 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Minister, in asking about the Saskatchewan Income Plan, I did ask the 
Minister of Social Services last night. If you had been in the House, you would know that I asked her 
about the Saskatchewan Income Plan. She said there would not be an increase. I find it interesting that 
you would have to ask your officials whether or not there was an increase in the Saskatchewan Income 
Plan, and that you as a part of a cabinet did not know there was no increase. So for you to try to say that 
I forgot to ask or . . . (inaudible) . . . What you’re doing right now simply shows that you do not know 
what is going on in your own government. The fact that you have to ask your officials whether or not 
there is an increase in the Saskatchewan Income Plan shows that you are not in complete control of what 
is going on in the government. 
 
What I would like to ask you is whether or not . . . In planning your budget, you have indicated that you 
did not take into consideration the increase in nursing home rates. Then you’re giving your assurance 
that in planning the budget there was no increase planned and that people will therefore not be expecting 
an increase. Certainly if you didn’t plan it in your budget, they won’t expect an increase. Is that true, or 
is that wrong? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — No, I told you previously that I did not take it into consideration. I’ve answered to 
you that I can’t say that there won’t be an increase in the coming year. I answered to you that there 
would not be one immediately after the session. And, you know, I would say to you, I can’t quite 
understand your reasoning. And you want to know why I would consult my officials. I want to tell you 
that these officials are here and these are some of the best officials in the Government of Saskatchewan, 
and I will consult them at any time and I make no apology for it. 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Chairman, I’m sure that the minister will listen to his  



 
May 3, 1983 

 
1767 

officials because they do know something about the department. And that’s the point I was trying to 
make, that the minister is not aware of whether the Saskatchewan Income Plan was increased or not, and 
would have to ask his officials. And that’s the point I’m making. But as of now, the people of the 
province are not being told by this government whether or not there will be a rate increase in nursing 
homes, and I suppose we will be left in limbo until the session is over and then, midsummer. I’m sure 
that knowing the trend of this government, in the dark of night they will come out with a rate increase 
when they think people are on holidays and the political pressure will not be as great. 
 
But we will make sure that we allow them, to let them know that this government is not doing things in 
the best interest of seniors. Given the fact that they promised free telephones, what the seniors got is an 
increase of 19 per cent in telephone rates; they promised a freeze on utility rates, and what the seniors 
are being asked to pay is a 22 per cent rate increase in power and 25 per cent in natural gas. What we are 
seeing here is an attack on those people who are the pioneers of the province, and you, Mr. Minister, 
will not now give them an assurance that the nursing home rates will be frozen in the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
In turning to the home care program, Mr. Minister, I wonder if you could give me an indication whether 
or not rates within the home care districts, for meals, and work done for individuals, has increased in the 
past year under your administration. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — The rates are set by the local boards, and they could vary across the province and 
they may have gone up, but it’s a local decision. 
 
Mr. Lingenfelter: — Well, Mr. Minister, you may say it’s a local decision, but I can tell you the reason 
they are going up, and in fact they are, is because you have not seen fit to put the money into the home 
care program that is needed. And you may quote that you’ve increased it by 10 per cent or 40 per cent or 
30 per cent, but I want to read to you a letter that was sent to clients of all home care people in one 
district at least – Watrous-Davidson home care district. And the letter was dated April 1st, 1983, and it 
says in part: 
 

As you are aware, ever since the home care services were started in this district our fees for 
services have remained constant. 
 

That’s under three years of an NDP administration. 
 

We have been very pleased over the last two years to provide services with one of the lowest 
client fees in the province. Your bills have been based on $2.89 per meal, and $3.64 per hour for 
home-making and handyman services. This, of course, does not come close to what it costs us to 
buy the meals and pay for the workers who come into your homes. Due to the economic crisis in 
existence at the present time, we are receiving almost no increases in government funding. 
 

That’s the provincial government they would be referring to because this program is totally funded by 
the provincial government. 
 

As you are aware, the cost of materials, food and labour has increased tremendously since we 
started providing our service in March of 1981. For this reason, we regret to inform you that we 
must raise fees you pay for services in order that we may continue giving you this service. Our 
client fees  



 
May 3, 1983 
 

 
1768 

will now be based on $4.25 for meals and $5.50 an hour for home-making and handyman 
services. 
 

Now what that means, Mr. Minister, is that people who get meals from this home care district are seeing 
a 50 per cent increase – in one year, a 50 per cent increase in meals because you have not seen fit to get 
the money that you needed to operate this program properly. For the home repair and the home plan that 
you have in place, the cost has increased by 45 per cent. 
 
And I have here a letter from an individual who is very concerned, and talks about the fact that she is not 
going to be able to maintain and use this program because the provincial government has failed to put 
the money into it so this home care district – Watrous-Davidson home care district – can function and 
function properly. 
 
And I would like you to explain how you expect the seniors of the province to believe all your boasting 
and . . . (inaudible) . . . way you talk, when what is happening is that the home care program is being 
undermined because of lack of funding. And I don’t want any story about 50 per cent increases because 
what we are seeing here is not a 50 per cent increase in provincial funding, but the lack of funding to the 
point that home care districts have to raise the cost of meals 50 per cent – not inflation minus one or five 
per cent, but more like the rates you are going to gouge the consumers and the seniors in power rates and 
natural gas. They will have to pay 22 and 25 per cent more for utilities from your crown corporations, 
but even more . . . and now they are going to have to pay 50 per cent more for the meals through the 
home care program. 
 
I’d like you to tell me how you square that with the pioneers of the province. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Well, I can indicate to you that the home care boards received a 7 per cent 
increase this year the same as most other groups did. Those were the guide-lines, 7 per cent increase this 
year, the same as most other groups did. Those were the guide-lines. In the case of the Watson home 
care district that you indicate in your letter, I don’t know what their rates were. You indicate two 
eighty-nine for meals. I would think, if you look at that comparing to the other ones across the province, 
it was rather low – quite a bit lower than the average. And what may have happened is that they got 
themselves into a jam in which they had to put up a . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . No I’m not blaming 
them; I’m explaining to you . . . 
 
If you would listen, I would perhaps explain to you what could be the reason why that increase. Now, if 
you don’t want to listen, that’s fine and dandy. You asked for an explanation so that’s what I’m giving 
you. I’m not putting the blame on anyone. I’m saying that that was the rate and the provincial rate was 
about four dollars. Now two eighty-nine is quite a bit different than four dollars. This board made that 
decision. It was their decision to keep it at two eighty-nine. Now, when they come to this year, they may 
have found that they didn’t have the funds because of them being lower before, being lower before, so 
therefore they had to increase them by 50 per cent. That was a local decision. That board made it – that’s 
their right to do so. 
 
The committee reported progress. 
 
The Assembly adjourned at 10:01 p.m.
