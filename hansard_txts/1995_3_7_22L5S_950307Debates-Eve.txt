EVENING SITTING 

 

PRIVATE MEMBERS' MOTIONS 

 

Motion No. 1   Unfair Contractor Tendering Policy 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was going to 

bring forward a piece brought . . . written by Bruce Johnstone 

that reads "NDP's Fair Wage Policy certainly isn’t.” And I think 

that says it all, Mr. Speaker, as to what this wage union 

preference policy is all about. 

 

So at this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to move adjournment 

of this debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I move the House do 

now adjourn. 

 

Mr. Speaker, if I could convert back, I had one amendment to a 

committee that I wanted to make before we adjourn the House. 

I would ask leave to do that. 

 

Leave granted.

 That the name of Evan Carlson be substituted for that of 

Lloyd Johnson on the standing committee on private 

bills committee. 

 

Motion agreed to. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 7:05 p.m.
