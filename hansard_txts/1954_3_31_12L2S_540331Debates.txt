LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

 

Second Session – Twelfth Legislature 

 

35th Day 

Wednesday, March 31, 1954 

 

The House met at eleven o’clock a.m. 

 

On the Orders of the Day: 

 

PROVINCIAL MUSEUM BUILDING 

 

Hon. C.C. Williams (Minister of Labour): 

 

Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with I would like to call the attention of the 

members to an article in this morning’s ‘Leader-Post’, page two, where Mr. Danielson, the member for 

Arm River, is reported as saying that the Provincial Government is building a million-dollar museum in 

the city of Regina to ‘glorify’ the city, while Saskatoon got very little in this regard; and such an amount 

would go a long way toward increasing the supplementary allowance for old people. 

 

I would just like to correct that, Mr. Speaker. It is not to ‘glorify’ the city of Regina. That museum will 

be here for the next 50 or 100 years for the use of the people of Saskatchewan. It is going to be a show-

place for the province of Saskatchewan, where citizens and tourists can appreciate it, and at $10 a month 

to the old-age pensioners of this province the amount involved would only last about 19 weeks. 

 

I do not want to get down to the level of St. Paul – Minneapolis jealousies, but Saskatoon has their 

University which has cost millions and will cost millions in the future, and we don’t mind that at all. I 

just want to make that comparison to correct any impression the public may get that this museum will 

‘glorify’ the city of Regina. 

 

Mr. Danielson (Arm River): 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would just like to answer that. I think his arithmetic is out, when he mentioned that 

amount of money lasting 19 weeks. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! You cannot hold a discussion on it. 

 

(Assembly in Committee of the Whole on Bills and Supply until adjournment at 11 o’clock p.m.)
