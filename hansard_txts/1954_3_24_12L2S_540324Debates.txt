Second Session – Twelfth Legislature 

30th Day 

 

Tuesday, March 24, 1954 

 

The House met a three o’clock p.m. 

 

SECOND READING 

 

Bill No. 86 – An Act to provide for Allowance to Disabled Persons. 

 

Hon. J. H. Sturdy (Minister of Social Welfare): — Mr. Speaker, this Bill has reference to allowances 

to be paid to permanently disabled people, and it has been discussed at the Dominion-Provincial 

conference held in Ottawa on January 26 of this year. 

 

All the conditions of this Act will be set forth in the Federal legislation, and the allowance will be 

administered according to regulations which are drawn up under the Federal Act. 

 

Such an Act has not been prepared as yet, and has not been submitted to Parliament, so we have to 

anticipate along the lines that the national Federal Act might be presented. We have done so, and we 

have had Ottawa check on this enabling legislation, and with the exception of one or two House 

amendments which I will submit in due course, they have given approval to the Bill. 

 

This Act will provide for the payment of an allowance of, we presume, $40 a month, commencing, we 

presume, January 1st, 1955. It is payable – we do not know yet the ages to which this Act will apply; but 

there are indications that it will follow the blind persons Act and the conditions under which the 

allowance is paid to blind persons. 

 

I think that the balance of the Act can be better discussed in Committee. Therefore, I move Second 

Reading of this Bill. 

 

The question being put, it was agreed to and the Bill referred to a Committee of the whole at the next 

sitting. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 6.00 o’clock p.m., without question put.
