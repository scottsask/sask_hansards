LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Second Session — Twelfth Legislature 

15th Day 

 

Wednesday, March 3, 1954 

The House met at three o‘clock p.m. 

 

BUDGET ADDRESS 

 

Hon. C. M. Fines (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, for the tenth successive year, it is my 

privilege and responsibility to move that Your Honour do now leave the chair and that this Assembly 

resolve itself into Committee of Supply. 

 

On this occasion, I should like first to add my welcome to the two new members of the Twelfth 

Legislature, and to express my congratulations to the Hon. member for Saltcoats upon his election as 

house leader for Her Majesty‘s Loyal Opposition. We look forward to comment from all three 

gentlemen with respect to the budget that may be as constructive as it will, no doubt be critical. 

 

Since my last budget address, Mr. Speaker, perhaps the most significant development in public affairs 

has been the slight turn for the better in international relations. I think all of us may be encouraged, in 

however small degree, by the statement given to Parliament a month ago by the Secretary of State for 

External Affairs. At that time, Mr. Pearson concluded that ―there is somewhat more hope for peace and 

stability in the world than existed a year ago.‖ Certainly, it is our desire that Canada should make a more 

real and positive contribution to the achievement of that hope, not merely by force of arms and atom 

bombs, but also through the arts of both economic aid and mutual trade. 

 

Indeed, as vital as these latter are to world peace, no less are they cornerstones to economic security and 

progress in Canada. No country has a greater stake in the mutual extension of international trade or in 

the raising of living standards throughout the underdeveloped areas of the world. The Deputy Governor 

of the Bank of Canada says that the chief ―uncertainty‖ with regard to the future course of our economy 

―is located outside of Canada.‖ And yet it is estimated that if the underfed people of Asia, Africa and 

Latin American could increase their per capita food intake by only one slice of bread each day, they 

would increase the annual world consumption of wheat by some 300 million bushels. 

 

THE ECONOMIC SETTING 

 

In turning first, Mr. Speaker, to a review of the economic setting for our budgetary proposals, I should 

like briefly to draw attention to the national economy. Estimates for 1953 show that total farm output 

decline slightly below the exceptional level of 1952, but that industrial production experienced a 

substantial increase. As a consequence, the gross national product, – that is the value of all goods and 

services produced by the economy, – is now estimated at about $24.2 billion up five per cent from the 

previous year. The increase was

reflected in a future growth of employment and personal income, with a corresponding rise in consumer 

expenditure. Similarly, total capital outlays are estimated to have increased by 9 per cent over the 

previous year, reaching the level of $5.6 billion. 

 

While 1953 as a whole thus turned out to be a highly favourable one, there were growing indications of 

possible weakness, especially in the latter half of the year. A number of important industries – livestock, 

textiles, iron and steel, and farm machinery, for instance – did not share in the rising trend. Export trade 

faltered somewhat, with an overall reduction of about 10 per cent. Increased sales to the United States 

failed to make up fully for a 25 per cent decline in exports to all other countries. Not the least significant 

of these declines, Mr. Speaker, was the decrease of 8 per cent from 1952‘s high export value of $973 

million for wheat, flour and other grains. Toward the last quarter of the year, moreover, the rate of 

expansion in industrial output tapered off rapidly. By the middle of winter, the abnormal rise of 

unemployment appeared to reflect more than normal seasonal influences, with consequent serious 

concern to everyone except, it seems, the Government at Ottawa. 

 

Looking at the national picture as a whole, the Bank of Montreal‘s ‗Business Review‘ commented at the 

end of the year: 

 

―As 1953 draws to a close, the economic weather, which for a prolonged period has been clear 

and sunny with only occasional patches of cloud, can best be described as ‗still sunny, but with 

increasing cloudiness and limited visibility‘.‖ 

 

How much of this may be due to the sunspots, Mr. Speaker, we had best leave perhaps to the theoretical 

physicists and economists. However, it does seem to me, that the Bank‘s comment can be applied with 

some accuracy to economic conditions within our own province. To these, I should like now to proceed. 

Much of what I have to say will already be familiar to Honourable Members. It seems essential, 

however, to present a fairly comprehensive summary at this time, since it is in the light of this picture 

that the government‘s financial policy must be appraised. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN’S FARM ECONOMY 

 

I think all of must agree that taken as a whole, 1953 has been another exceptionally good year for 

Saskatchewan. In fact, the year past has been featured by some very sunny economic highlights. At the 

same time, there have been squalls and thunderclouds, – and these may be less important in themselves 

than for what they may foretell for the year ahead. Nevertheless, from this immediate point of view, it 

can be said that 1953 has added further stature to one of the most remarkable periods of economic and 

social progress in the fifty years‘ history of our province. 

 

For the third successive time, our farmers harvested an exceptionally large grain crop, second only to the 

phenomenal high of 1952. The wheat crop alone totalled 375 million bushels, a decline of 13 per cent 

from the previous year, but 61 per cent higher than the average of the ten preceding years. A preliminary 

estimate of the gross 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

3 

value of principal field crops, based upon initial prices only as set by the Wheat Board, is $628 million, 

also a record second only to 1952. 

 

With regard to livestock, poultry and dairy products, total cash income for 1953 was narrowly higher 

than in 1952. Unfortunately, the year was marked by the kind of price and production instability that 

more and more focuses attention upon the need for more orderly marketing systems. Thus, cattle 

marketing showed an increase of 40 per cent over 1952, but price declines resulted in total income to 

producers rising by only 10 per cent. On the other hand, the volume of hog marketings fell by over 21 

per cent, with total receipts to producers falling in almost equal proportion. 

 

RECORD CASH INCOME 

 

In the aggregate, cash farm income is estimated at close to $713 million, an advance of about $12 

million over the previous year‘s record. In contrast to Saskatchewan‘s advance, cash farm income for 

Canada as a whole was reduced by some 4 per cent. The situation in this province was bolstered by 

record marketings of grain for the first seven months of the year and by substantial delayed payments on 

earlier deliveries to the Wheat Board. In the last quarter of the year, the slowdown in grain deliveries cut 

the flow of cash income, and many farmers began to feel the pinch of a reduced liquid position. 

 

Despite the extraordinarily high level of cash income for the province, the accrued net income position 

of our farm industry shows a considerable decline. As the term suggested, accrued net income is a 

business measure of gross income less operating and depreciation expenses, and adjusted for changes in 

the value of farm inventories. Our preliminary estimate for 1953 is about $478 million. This may be 

compared to the previous year‘s record of $574 million, and the average of $377 million for the 1946-52 

period. 

 

As against this, it will be of interest to note that actual purchasing power in the hands of our farm 

families continued to rise. If we take cash from income and deduct operating expenses, depreciation and 

direct taxes, we arrive at a measure that might be called disposable or not realized income. A 

preliminary estimate for 1953 is about $400 million, representing a steady increase from $371 million in 

1952, $336 million in 1951, and only $159 million in 1950. 

 

DECLINE IN FARM AND MUNICIPAL DEBT 

 

The favourable farm income picture of the past three years has led to a very substantial increase in 

capital investment in machinery and equipment. It has also contributed to the further decline in long 

term mortgage debt. Canadian Farm Loan Board loans increased moderately to $7 million in 1952. On 

the other hand, farm mortgages held by thirty leading private companies, were reduced to $12.8 million 

in 1952. This was a reduction of 22 per cent, or $3.6 million, from the previous year. Most of the 

Honourable Members will recall that in 1936 this same debt load on Saskatchewan farmers totalled a 

crushing $108 million. 

 

It is also interesting to observe, Mr. Speaker, that the rural municipalities of the province, which are 

most directly affected by the farm income position, have also been reducing their total indebtedness. 

Data recently published by the Bank of Canada indicate the following picture for the three prairie 

provinces:

MINERAL RESOURCES DEVELOPING 

 

Apart from agriculture, Mr. Speaker, the increasing tempo of mineral development during 1953 

continued to highlight Saskatchewan‘s march to a more diversified economic base. Here, oil and 

uranium again shared the spotlight. At the same time, base metals and industrial minerals also made 

substantial gains. The first figures on total value of output show a slight decline to $48 million, owing to 

the reduced value of zinc production. I draw your attention, however, to the fact that the published 

figures do not include the growing output of our uranium mines. If these figures were added, new record 

levels of mineral production would undoubtedly be shown. 

 

The year 1953 was notable for the actual beginning of shipments of uranium concentrates from 

Saskatchewan. Even more noteworthy was the greatly increased exploration program ranging across the 

120,000 square miles of pre-Cambrian northland. With a record number of prospects and search parties 

at work, claims staked rose more than four-fold. Some 90 companies were engaged in active exploration 

of holdings, including underground work in at least eight new uranium prospects and one new base 

metal mine. At the present time, discussions are proceeding on the price formula for uranium ores. 

Possible upward revisions will add further stimulus to commercial production. 

 

OIL AND GAS RECORDS 

 

The highlights in oil and gas development during the past year, Mr. Speaker, will be so familiar to the 

Assembly that only the briefest of references will be necessary today. No doubt the most dramatic gains 

were the discovery of the Smiley light oil field and the construction of the Brock-Saskatoon natural gas 

system. Important as these were, they were only special features of a development program reaching 

into every corner of the sedimentary area of the Province. In every detail, the statistical records indicate 

new peaks achieved. Total investment, for example, is estimated at $52 million, not counting very 

extensive expenditure on refinery expansion. This year will see even higher figures, perhaps up to $68 

million, particularly if major pipeline construction now being considered for the southwestern fields is 

actually launched. Production increased to 2,800,000 barrels of oil and 1½ billion cubic feet of natural 

gas. These are records that may well be doubled in 1954. 

 

With respect to other resources, Mr. Speaker, it is a special pleasure to recall my references in earlier 

budget speeches to Saskatchewan‘s potential, first, for a pulp mill industry, and second, for the 

production of potash materials. The past year saw further important steps taken toward the realization of 

both of these hopes. Development agreements were reached by the Government with leading companies 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

5 

in these respective fields. The pulp mill possibility is important not merely for the employment and 

income it will create, but also for the contribution it will make toward the program of effective forest 

utilization and conservation. As for the potash development, I need only point out that there is no 

production in Canada at the present time and in 1952-53 some 150,000 tons of potash materials were 

imported into the country. 

 

CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING 

 

The record pace set in resource development has been matched by steady gains in nearly all other 

sectors of the economy. In the construction industry, the value of work performed jumped from $181 

million in 1952 to about $217 million, in 1953. Average employees in the industry rose to 24,000 and 

construction proved itself to be one of the strongest influences in maintaining a high level of labour 

demand. Electric power generated and consumed within the Province maintained a rapid rate of growth, 

with total kilowatt hours rising by some 16 per cent. In manufacturing the latest available figure is an 

estimated $276 million in gross value of production for 1952. Manufacturing employment increased 

slightly, while capital investment in plant and machinery advanced from $15.9 million in the previous 

year to $21 million in 1953. 

 

INVESTMENT, INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT 

 

In drawing together these varied aspects of the provincial economy, Mr. Speaker, it is helpful to take 

note of the overall level of investment, income and employment. As Honourable Members know, the 

forecast of capital expenditure for 1953, published by the Federal Government early last year, was for a 

total of $24 million, up by more than 8 per cent over the previous year‘s record. In the six year period 

since these surveys were first undertaken, investment in new construction and equipment and in repair 

and maintenance of our productive capital structure has totalled more than $2,100 million. This 

increasing investment has been accompanied by a steady rise in business population. New records were 

set in 1953, with 346 new companies incorporated, 253 extra-provincial companies registering, and 513 

partnerships being formed. 

 

The most useful overall yardstick of income is the estimate of personal income receipts. As noted 

before, net farm income fell below the extremely high level of 1952. This fall, however, was very 

largely counter-balanced by gains in other sectors. Our early estimate for the Province is placed 

therefore, at about $1,170 million, compared with $1,182 million in 1952. Our per capita income figure 

of $1,360 is again about 12 per cent above the national average. 

 

It is clear, moreover, that total disposable income in the hands of Saskatchewan consumers reached a 

new high during 1953. This was reflected in increased personal expenditure as measured by the value of 

retail sales. For the third successive year, Saskatchewan led all provinces in annual percentage gain. The 

1953 total rose by 7.2 per cent to an estimated $817 million. At the same time, a 15 per cent increase in 

life insurance sales during the year suggests a parallel advance in personal saving.

As for employment, it is revealing to turn to indexes published by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. 

Throughout 1953, these monthly indexes revealed a steady advance over the corresponding periods for 

the previous year, and the average monthly index on the base 1949 = 100 rose by 4.6 points to 116.0 in 

1953. This may be compared with an increase of only 1.7 points for the country as a whole. Thee 

indexes, Mr. Speaker, take on particular interest when set alongside current population data. Together 

with Hospital Plan registrations and regional Family Allowance information, they help to confirm the 

estimated increase of 29,000 people from 1951 to 1953. The growth last year is especially significant in 

that it shows that not only did the Province retain the whole of its numerical natural increase but in 

addition, received a net inflow of about 1,700 people. Our population statistics indicate that this was the 

first such net in-movement experienced by the Province in over twenty years. 

 

ECONOMIC PROSPECT 

 

It is against this general background, Mr. Speaker, that I should like once again to try to peer into the 

immediate and longer-term future. Needless to say, even at best, forecasting for an economy such as 

ours is an extremely tricky business. Today, the uncertainty in the world economic climate compounds 

our difficulty. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that although we have made tremendous gains in strengthening 

our productive potential and efficiency, we are still critically dependent upon the vagaries of markets 

beyond the province, beyond the country, and beyond the continent. Consequently, the provincial 

outlook is very much a matter of the national and international outlook. 

 

The Federal forecast for the Canadian economy in 1954-55 is not yet available, but the official view 

seems to lean toward the optimistic prospect that employment and income will continue at close to 1953 

levels. As for the crucial influence of the United States economy, the most widely held opinion is for a 

decline of about five per cent or more in overall economic activity in that country. The broadest question 

seems to be whether or not such a decline is likely to precipitate difficulties for Canada directly, or 

indirectly because of its impact upon the foreign exchange reserves of the sterling and other non-dollar 

economies. 

 

Apart from these general influences, specific difficulties for Saskatchewan may lie in the marketing 

outlook for coarse grains and livestock, particularly toward the end of 1954. Of critical importance, 

however, is the prospect ahead for exports of wheat. Since my budget address of a year ago, the 

International Wheat Agreement has been renewed for three years, with the range of prices fixed 

somewhat higher than under the former five-year agreement. But the withdrawal of the United Kingdom 

from the agreement, the restoration of the speculative grain trade in that country under the Conservative 

Government, the accumulation of record world stocks and the continued imbalance in world trade, are 

all sources of potential danger upon which we must keep a wary eye indeed.

CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM 

 

Notwithstanding these storm clouds on the horizon, Mr. Speaker, I still think there is much to justify, 

Mr. Speaker, I still think there is much to justify cautious optimism concerning the prospective 

economic climate. Within Canada itself, as I have already suggested, the official Federal view seems to 

be that a high level of consumer expenditure, together with the strong growth elements in the economy, 

promise another good year. Defence spending is tapering off, but the economy will continue to be 

supported by firm Government commitments on record peacetime military expenditure. In both Canada 

and the United States, moreover, it does not seem possible that Federal Governments will be so blind as 

to fail to take prompt and vigorous action in staving off a serious depression. 

 

On the specific question of wheat marketing, there are some important encouraging factors. Certainly, 

despite some decline in world import requirements in 1953-54, a long-time build-up in world 

consumption is underway, and we need to seek expanding markets not only in the United Kingdom and 

Western Europe, but also in Asia and Latin America. The year 1954 is likely to see some decline in 

world output, particularly with acreage reductions in the United States. Again, the current policy 

proposals of the U. S. Administration on ―isolating excess commodity reserves‖ from regular market 

channels, together with the stabilizing influence of the Canadian Wheat Board, lessens the threat of fire-

sale dumping. And finally, provided that balance of payments difficulties can be held in check, Canadian 

hard wheat will continue to command a real advantage among world wheat consumers. 

 

Closer at home, I think we have reason for continuing confidence in our own provincial economy. So 

far, there is every prospect for a sustained high level of agricultural output, and for the first three 

quarters of the year at least, most farm prices should be reasonably well maintained. Even if the grain 

harvest were to fall below normal, the grain inventories stored on Saskatchewan farms at the beginning 

of the year amounted to more than 300 million bushels of wheat and 215 million bushels of oats and 

barley. Stocks of this order alone amount to a bumper harvest for any one year and at current market 

prices are valued at better than $680 million. Apart from agriculture, there is every indication of still 

further advances in the development of oil and gas, of metallic and industrial minerals, of forest and 

other resources. Manufacturing and service industries continue to grow at a steady pace. Construction 

expenditure may well reach a new record, and we should be surprised if total capital investment over the 

year is curtailed below current levels. In summary, – and bearing fully in mind that the uncertainties of 

the economic weather dictate a need for caution – I think we can look forward to another good year for 

Saskatchewan. I anticipate some levelling off in the peak levels of output and income enjoyed during the 

past two years, but that such a levelling should have only moderate influences on the continued growth 

of provincial revenues. 

 

I turn now, Mr. Speaker, from this attempt to appraise the economic outlook to the annual review of 

provincial financial accounts.

FISCAL YEAR 1952 – 1953 

 

Earlier in the session, the Public Accounts for the last fiscal years, 1952-53, were tabled. These 

accounts, together with the annual report of the Liquor Board, disclose a surplus of current revenues 

over current expenditures amounting to $14,890,770. This surplus consisted of a $4,725,000 surplus on 

Revenue Account, plus $10,165,000 of liquor profits not taken in to Revenue Account. These surplus 

revenues, along with borrowings, were used to finance a heavy capital program of around 30 million 

dollars. 

 

Taking current and capital expenditures together, and excluding debt reduction payments, over 42 per 

cent of total expenditures were for economic development, and roughly 46 per cent went toward public 

welfare and education. The balance went for general government operations and debt charges. The 

increasing percentage of the budget being spent on economic development is evidence of this 

Government‘s consistent efforts toward an expanding Saskatchewan economy. 

 

During the same year, as I shall outline later, the Government was able to implement its policy of 

reducing debt in peak periods of our economy. 

 

CURRENT FISCAL YEAR 1953–54 

 

I can confidently predict the same healthy trends in our finances for the current fiscal year. I believe that 

current revenues, plus liquor profits, will this year exceed current expenditures by roughly $18,000,000. 

Once again, a sizeable surplus has made possible heavy capital expenditures for an expanding economy. 

This year, capital expenditures will exceed $40,000,000. 

 

So our emphasis on expanding and diversifying Saskatchewan‘s economy has persisted. I estimate that 

in the current fiscal year expenditures on economic development – both current and capital – will 

amount to approximately 45.6 per cent of the total (not including debt reduction payments). At the same 

time, Saskatchewan is maintaining its high standard of health, welfare and educational services with 

roughly 43.6 per cent of the budget being spent on these services. The balance, roughly 11 per cent, is 

being devoted to general government and debt services. 

 

In 1953-54, as in 1952-53, Mr. Speaker, the Government followed a debt reduction policy. The full 

impact of this policy is of such importance that I propose, later, to outline fully how this has been 

accomplished. 

 

REVENUE AND CAPITAL BUDGETS, 1954-55 

 

The estimates for next year, 1954-55, reflect the same trend in policy. They provide for the following 

revenues and expenditures: 

 

ON REVENUE ACCOUNT 

Estimated Revenue . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 78,415,520

Estimated Surplus . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 295,700

9 

 

ON CAPITAL ACCOUNT   

Estimated Expenditures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 21,374,500 

 

To the capital expenditures may be added a sum of $23,000,000 to be advanced to the Saskatchewan 

Power Corporation and Saskatchewan Government Telephones, to make a total budget on Capital 

Account of $44,374,500. 

 

If one adds estimated liquor profits to the estimated surplus on Revenue Account, it is apparent that we 

are planning a surplus of current revenues over current expenditures of nearly $10,300,000. This will be 

possible, Mr. Speaker, without any new taxes or any increases in the existing taxes. 

 

The objectives of this budget, as of previous budgets, are three fold: To expand and diversity 

Saskatchewan‘s economy; to maintain and extend, as our economy expands, Saskatchewan‘s leadership 

in public welfare and education programs; and to manage prudently the public finances in this Province. 

 

This is a budget, Mr. Speaker, which accomplishes these three objectives. It is a prudent budget since, 

once again, we propose not to increase the net debt in 1954-55. We shall use the liquor profits together 

with the anticipated surplus this year on Revenue Account to help provide the funds for the capital 

program I have just outlined. I do not anticipate that we shall borrow any greater amount than we did 

during the current year and, indeed, I am quite confident that we shall again next year bring in a 

statement of debt reduction. 

 

This is a budget, Mr. Speaker, which provides for the development both of economic and human 

resources. That this is so should hardly be surprising, since the Government was elected on precisely this 

platform. Our 10-point program provided for the expansion of power, natural gas and transportation 

facilities, and for the continued development of agricultural, oil, mineral and other natural resources. 

The extension and development of educational, health and public welfare services was also provided for 

in this program. How those policies will be furthered in 1954-55 is apparent in the highlights of the 

budget. 

 

AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT 

 

The first major increase in the 1954-55 budget, Mr. Speaker, is properly allocated to the expansion of 

our agricultural industry. Total expenditures on agriculture will, for the first time, exceed $5,000,000 – 

an increase of 31 per cent over the current budget. 

 

Our agricultural policy is made up of two chief components: advice and assistance to farmers on 

methods of increasing production, and direct government projects which both increase productivity and 

increase the amount of land under production. The first phase of agricultural policy will continue at the 

same high level as in previous years; indeed, the budget of the Agricultural Representatives Branch will 

increase from $385,000 to $419,000. 

 

In the past few years, major emphasis has been placed on provincial government projects. And the 

achievements have played a significant part in increasing the agricultural production of this Province. 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

10 

By the end of 1953, there were 1,700,000 acres in drainage projects. 55,000 acres in irrigation projects, 

and 743,000 acres in community pastures and other projects. At the same time some 182,000 acres had 

been cleared and broken, and 1,720 new farm units established. 

 

This latter project – the clearing and breaking of new areas – is one of the most difficult the Government 

has undertaken. Indeed it is not unlike the job faced by Saskatchewan‘s pioneers – ranging from the 

selection of suitable land to the establishment of complete community services. 

 

The complexity of the project, as a part of the total agricultural picture of the Province, was recognized 

by the Government when it appointed the Royal Commission on Agriculture and Rural Life. In its 

interim report, it has recommended, – and the Minister of Agriculture has recommended, – that greater 

assistance should be given to the settlers of these new areas in order that they might help themselves to 

get more land under cultivation, more mechanization, and better community services. In 1954-55, 

therefore, it is proposed to vote close to $1,200,000 for this purpose. At present, settlers who clear and 

break provincially-owned land are paid for the work by an instalment plan. The increased vote will 

make it possible to supplement the instalment plan with lump-sum payments for much of the clearing 

and breaking done. 

 

OIL AND MINERAL RESOURCES 

 

Parallel with our agricultural program, Mr. Speaker, is a more ambitious program for the expansion and 

development of our other natural resources. I have already outlined Saskatchewan‘s record 

improvements in the development of such resources as oil, natural gas, uranium, potash and hardrock 

minerals. This is a budget which contemplates, and will stimulate, even greater achievements in 

1954-55. 

 

The Department of Mineral Resources will receive an appropriation roughly 50 per cent higher than in 

the current year – nearly $900,000 instead of the $597,000 of the current year. The major increases are 

in the Petroleum and Natural Gas Branch, which will move from a $218,000 to a $324,000 budget. 

Greater provision is being made for the accumulation and analysis of petroleum and natural gas data; for 

the continuous assessment of field and reservoir operations; and for the enforcement of conservation 

regulations and safety precautions. 

 

The balance of the Department, responsible for the development of industrial and metallic minerals, will 

continue at the same high level of activity. Perhaps I should mention, Mr. Speaker, the greatly increased 

appropriations for recording the disposition of crown mineral rights. We are pleased that this increase 

has been made necessary – it is a reflection of the record breaking 18,000 claims staked this year. 

 

The number of claims staked, and the other figures I have quoted on minerals activity, are, in 

themselves, a good index of resource development. But an index usually assumed to be of greater 

interest to a Provincial Treasurer is ―How much are you collecting as a result?‖ This is indeed a 

satisfying index! In 1953-54, our receipts from mineral resources 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

11 

will be around $10,000,000. Of this amount, roughly $4½ millions are recurring revenues from mineral 

resources, close to $2½ million will come from back mineral taxes, and around $3 million is expected 

from the sale of production leases and exploration permits. In 1954-55, we expect recurring revenues to 

rise from the $4½ million to 6 million dollars, and while we are not depending on windfall revenues, we 

do nevertheless anticipate that there will be some. 

 

I would like Honourable Members to note the distinction being made between recurring revenues and 

―windfalls.‖ For this is an important distinction in financial planning. It has been Government policy, 

Mr. Speaker, that windfalls from the sale of exploration or production rights on crown lands will not be 

used to finance current expenditures. Where school lands are involved, the proceeds are being deposited 

and the windfalls from other crown lands are being used – and will continue to be used – only for capital 

development, debt redemption, or sinking fund payments. 

 

POWER AND NATURAL GAS 

 

The extension of power to farms, towns and villages and the distribution of natural gas to larger cities 

figured largely in the 10-point program on which this Government was elected. Our record in 1953 is 

already well known. The number of kilowatt hours generated by the Power Corporation increased by 

19.6 per cent; the number of customers served was increased from 86,500 to 100,000; 6,000 miles of 

transmission and rural power line were constructed, and 5,500 farms were electrified. 

 

It is well known, too, Mr. Speaker, that there are now over 5,000 customers served by the Power 

Corporation‘s natural gas system, and that this phase of our program, like others, is right on schedule. 

 

Provision has been made to advance to the Power Corporation, next fiscal year, $14,000,000 for the 

further extension of the power and natural gas systems. Increased power consumption, and projected 

farm electrification will necessitate increased generating capacity and improved distribution facilities. 

Also scheduled in the Corporation‘s work program for 1954-55, is the steady expansion of the Brock-

Saskatoon natural gas system. This will provide for a substantial increase in the total number of services 

and for extensions to new reserves of gas supply. 

 

TELEPHONES AND OTHER CORPORATIONS 

 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones, in turn, will next year receive in advances from the Treasury a 

record-breaking $9,000,000. More telephones will be added to the system; indeed 10,860 were added in 

1953 compared with 8,600 in 1952. Improved long distance service will result from this new investment. 

All of this requires, of course, new central exchange facilities, new buildings to house these facilities 

and staff to operate them. 

 

The final audits of all the corporations for the fiscal year ending in 1953 have not yet been completed. 

On the basis of preliminary figures, however, the financial results as a whole continued to be highly 

satisfactory. The corporations reached a new high in volume of business turn-over – close to 

$40,000,000. Employment was maintained at 4,400

salary and wage-earners, while the net book value of our revenue producing assets increased to over 

$100,000,000. 

 

Exclusive of the Wool Products company, the sale of which is now being negotiated, the total earnings 

of the ten corporations rose from $5,126,000 in 1952 to $5,820,000 in 1953. This is before charging 

interests costs, and represents a rate of return of over 7 per cent on all capital advances from the 

Treasury, outstanding at fiscal year ends. This overall earnings rate was achieved in spite of the fact that 

close to $7 million was advanced to the Power Corporation for construction of the gas system which did 

not go into operation until very late in the year. 

 

The group of eight smaller corporations, all of which reported net profits, earned about $876,000 on 

capital advances outstanding of $9,630,000. This was an earnings rate before interest of slightly better 

than 9 per cent. Several of the companies, moreover, made significant individual gains. The Insurance 

Office experienced its largest increase in premium volume in any one year of its history. The Timber 

Board entered into long term contracts for the export of pulp-wood. Marked improvement in production 

efficiency was secured by the Minerals Corporation, especially in the Estevan brick plant, with total 

earnings climbing from less than $30,000 in 1952 to $112,000 in 1953. And with its business volume 

rising by 26 per cent, Government Airways undertook a notable expansion of service and facilities, in 

carrying out its key role in the rapid development of our northern frontier. 

 

HIGHWAYS 

 

Always of paramount interest to Honourable Members, Mr. Speaker, is our progress on the highway 

program. The Government undertook a $75,000,000 highway program in this term of office, and we are 

certainly not behind schedule. In the last two years, there has already been spent on highways almost 

$34,500,000. This includes a supplementary amount of $1,100,000 for the current year which 

Honourable Members will be asked to approve. 

 

For 1954-55, the Legislature is being asked to vote for Highways, on Revenue and Capital Accounts, a 

total of $18,600,000. This vastly improved highway system is not only a source of comfort to casual 

motorists; it is a medium of commerce and industry of greatly increased importance. 

 

The people of Saskatchewan are proud of their accomplishments in highway building. But they are also 

concerned, with the increasing accident rate, with its cost in lives and money, and with the cost of 

highway maintenance resulting from the heavy commercial traffic. The Government shares this concern. 

Therefore, it is proposed in 1954-55 to double the highway patrols being provided by the R.C.M.P. In 

other words, 24 new men will be added to our Provincial force, to enforce the provisions of The 

Vehicles Act and The Highways and Transportation Act.

GOVERNMENT AND THE EXPANDED ECONOMY 

 

This is an exciting period in Saskatchewan‘s economy, Mr. Speaker. And government itself is an 

exciting job when you consider all the intricate relationships between the programs involved in 

economic expansion. These inter-relationships are to be found throughout this budget. An expanding 

power and gas program, for example, requires a whole host of co-ordinated actions: Provincial-

municipal negotiations are necessary in the planning stage; man-power must be obtained, and the 

Apprenticeship Program of the Department of Labour comes into the picture; materials must be obtained 

by the Corporation in sufficient time that man-hours and service-hours are not lost; a big job of 

financing must be done by the Treasury; the Corporation and Departments concerned must be staffed; 

and safety inspection services must be expanded at the right time in the Department of Labour in order 

that the public safety is safeguarded. 

 

So you see not only higher capital budgets, but a 37 per cent increase in the Apprenticeship Branch, a 54 

per cent increase in the Electrical and Gas Inspection Branch, and increased staff accommodation 

provided by the Public Works Department. Increasing activity in the north, spurred by the activities of 

the two resource departments, results not only in increased budgets for them – Natural Resources will 

next year receive 12 per cent more than this year – but an increased activity by Saskatchewan 

Government Airways, more extensive fire control measures, and even the marking of the Saskatchewan-

Northwest Territories boundary! Nothing would have seemed less important ten years ago, yet because 

of claims staking it has become very essential today. 

 

THE HEALTH PROGRAM 

 

There is another inter-relationship which is of crucial importance. Honourable Members will recall the 

Government‘s assurance that the benefits of an expanding economy would be passed on to the people. 

This we have been doing, and will continue to do, through our health, welfare and education programs. 

These were, you will recall, Mr. Speaker, three of the points in our 10-point program. Yet always, in 

extending these benefits, the Government is keenly aware of the necessity of building them on a firm 

and lasting founding. 

 

Increased revenues will make possible, next year, an increase of over $1,500,000 in the Public Health 

budget – bringing the total to over $20,000,000 on Revenue Account. A significant portion of this 

budget will be devoted to preventive health services, with provision being made for the establishment of 

a new health region. 

 

The medical and hospital care programs continue to occupy a position of even greater prominence. The 

mental health program will, next year, cost $5,800,000 with an additional $2,000,000 being spent for 

badly needed expansion of the mental institutions. The provision of medical services to the recipients of 

pensions and social aid will cost some 1¼ millions of dollars. The Cancer Commission will require ¾ of 

a million dollars, and grants to T.B. Sanatoria will amount of $600,000. 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

14 

It is noteworthy that the community has assumed heavy medical care costs for a relatively small 

percentage of the population. Whereas half a century ago the mentally ill, the aged, the chronically ill, 

the needy, were cared for in the homes of their families, this job has now been assigned to governments. 

And it is a costly job, a job delegated to government because of a highly specialized and industrialized 

society; a job made larger by the stresses and strains of this society. 

 

Certainly it is costing more to care for those unable to care for themselves but it is not particularly 

helpful simply to complain that budgets are getting larger. Surely no-one would suggest that because 

care for the mentally ill will this year cost some $5,800,000, that we should stop caring for them. The 

essential problem faced by this and all governments is to find, through research and careful planning, a 

way in which the mentally ill can be restored to society, a way to prevent the ravages of cancer, a way to 

keep people from becoming needy. 

 

While searching for these more lasting solutions, we in the community of Saskatchewan must be 

prepared constantly to seek methods of providing this care more economically and stable sources of 

income with which to sustain the services we have undertaken to provide. 

 

SOCIAL WELFARE 

 

The same approach is being taken in providing improved welfare services. Some expansion has become 

possible this year, so the Government has decided to give greater emphasis to its rehabilitation program. 

 

The budget of the Rehabilitation Branch will be increased and provision is being made, under 

Dominion-Provincial agreement, for a co-ordinator who will examine more closely the rehabilitation 

needs in Saskatchewan. At the same time, he will work will all departments of the Government, with the 

Federal Government, and with private welfare agencies, to tie together more effectively the programs 

already in existence. 

 

The first direct expansion in this field has come through the Department of Public Health with its 

expanded services to handicapped persons. This program, which I mentioned last year, is now enjoying 

some limited assistance from the Federal Government. In a different area of rehabilitation, the 

establishment of the Bureau of Alcoholism should assist us in finding a solution to this chronic social 

problem. 

 

The other expansion of activity in the Department of Social Welfare is in the housing and nursing care 

for the aged program. The Melfort Nursing Home will be completed in 1954, and it is proposed to start a 

200 bed Nursing Home in Regina. We will continue our 20 per cent capital grant to assist church and 

welfare organizations and local governments in the construction of housing for our senior citizens. Next 

year, we shall also increase operating grants to nursing homes from a flat $300 annually to $40 per bed 

per annum. 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

15 

EDUCATION 

 

The Government has always given particular attention to education in Saskatchewan. Since 1944, 

expenditures have vastly increased, and the education function has enjoyed a consistently high 

percentage of the budget. In 1943-44, the Education budget was just over $4,000,000, or 15 per cent of 

the total Revenue account budget; in 1952-53, the budget had climbed to over $11,500,000 or 17.6 per 

cent of the total; and in 1954-55, the budget will be $14,460,000, roughly 18 per cent of the total budget. 

 

It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that this and previous governments have been concerned that education services 

be based on a stable source of income. It almost alone has enjoyed, at the Provincial level, a special 

revenue source – the 2/3 share of the Education and Hospitalization Tax. It alone receives the earnings 

of a capital fund which remains intact – the School Lands Fund which now stands at $23,000,000. It 

alone received the earnings from lands set aside to assist in financing a specific program. 

 

At the local level, education is supported by property taxes, a source of revenue far more stable than a 

sales tax which will fluctuate as widely as retail sales of commodities other than food and drugs will 

fluctuate. This local source of income was strengthened recently by this Government when it stepped out 

of the property tax field, and turned over the public revenue tax to municipalities. 

 

The Government is anxious that the responsibility borne by local governments and the Provincial 

Government be so divided that the education system be as well insulated from economic fluctuations as 

possible. That is why the Government of Saskatchewan has given greater assistance to education from 

its sources of income, gradually, as it was reasonably sure that the level of assistance could be sustained. 

 

Let me give two examples, Mr. Speaker. There has been a gradual increase in grants to the University of 

Saskatchewan, from $550,000 in 1944-45, to $900,000 in 1949-50, and $1,275,000 in 1953-54. Next 

year, the grant will be increased to nearly $1,600,000. At the same time, some $12,175,000 has been 

spent in providing new and improved buildings and facilities at the University in the last eight years. 

 

Direct assistance has been given the teachers, too, through the superannuation plan. In 1944-45, some 

$120,000 was paid on account of teachers‘ pensions; by 1949-50, it had risen to $150,000; and in the 

current year an amount of $385,000 was voted. Next year, this Government will contribute close to 

$530,000, an increase of 440 per cent since 1944-45. 

 

Similarly, grants to schools have increased steadily. In 1944-45, the grants amounted to $3,166,000; in 

1949-50, they were $5,240,000; and in 1953-54 over $8,800,000. I am happy to announce, Mr. Speaker, 

that the budget for the next fiscal year makes provision for a further increase in school grants of 

$1,000,000. 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

16 

AID TO LOCAL AREAS 

 

One further development in our financial policy may be mentioned at this point. For several years, the 

budget has provided annual sums for making direct loans to local school authorities to assist in their 

capital building and equipment programs. The total amount provided exceeds $3,600,000. Such loans, of 

course, have been directed toward areas where the need is greatest and where alternative sources of 

capital funds are not available. 

 

Since 1952, our policy has been broadened by purchasing a limited volume of debentures from school 

authorities which meet difficulty in selling their securities through regular investment channels. 

Unfortunately, the capital market has been slow to recognize the vast improvement in the financial 

strength of our local authorities, and the fact that the debentures of even our smaller communities now 

constitute an excellent investment medium. 

 

During the current year, our investment policy has been further extended to provide for a limited 

purchase of debentures issued by municipal governments for the purpose of financing self-liquidating 

projects. Our investment funds are limited in amount, of course, so that the purchase policy must be a 

selective one. As before, it is directed toward those local areas which, despite their sound financial 

position, still meet difficulty in the sale of debentures through the regular channels. It is planned that the 

policy will be progressively extended as resources become available. Any municipality which shows 

evidence of need, and of a determined local effort reflecting confidence in its own future, can count 

upon the Government for full co-operation in the problem of financing soundly planned, self-supported 

projects. 

 

CAPITAL FINANCING, 1953-54 

 

During my review of provincial expenditure, Mr. Speaker, I have drawn attention to major items of a 

capital nature. I should like now to summarize these items, and to indicate the relationship of capital 

investment to our overall program of finance and debt management. As I have already indicated, capital 

account expenditures during the current fiscal year total over $40 million. In addition, the sum of 

$8,915,000 is being provided to retire the following debt maturities: 

 

DEBT MATURITIES, 1953-54

Sept. 1, 1945 Sept. 1, 1953 3 1/3% $ 150,000

March 3, 1954 

 

 

17 

Thus, it can be seen that during 1953-54 we shall spend on capital account and for debt retirement 

almost $49,000.000. This has been financed in part by borrowing as indicated in the following table: 

 

CAPITAL BORROWING . . 1953-54

Oct. 1, 1953 Oct 1, 1969 4 1/4 % Canada  6,000,000 

      

It will not be necessary to borrow any further amounts during the present fiscal year, since the balance 

of the capital program is being financed from current revenues and surplus. 

 

DEBT REDUCTION 

 

In spite of our very high expenditures on capital account, the net debt of the Province was reduced 

further in 1953 by $7,150,000. It thus relieves the people of the Province of a tax burden amounting to 

some $500,000 annually for interest and sinking fund payments. During the past ten years, the net debt 

has been cut by $87,000,000, a reduction of almost 50 per cent. The greatly improved debt position of 

the Province can be seen more clearly by an analysis of the following table:

18 

It should be pointed out that because of certain deferred advances, the position is actually better than is 

reflected in the above tables. By December 31, 1953, the fiscal year‘s entire borrowings had been 

completed, as shown by the gross debt, but cash on hand remaining with the Treasury and available for 

power and telephones totalled $5,226,000. As these funds are actually advanced, the net debt will be 

reduced still further to $85,406,000. The actual reduction of net debt since December 31, 1952, amounts 

therefore, to $12,373,000. 

 

From time to time in this Legislature, and outside it, Mr. Speaker, I have endeavoured to distinguish 

between dead-weight debt and self-liquidating debt. The latter may also be described as debt for revenue 

producing enterprises. To date, I do not seem to have made much impression on my friends opposite, or 

on some of their paid radio propagandists. They claim that in other provinces, net debt is obtained by 

deducting only sinking funds from gross debt. This, of course, is utter nonsense as reference to the 

Budget Addresses for 1953 of the Provincial Treasurers of British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario will 

conclusively prove. In every case, in addition to subtracting sinking funds from the gross debt, the self-

liquidating debt is also deducted to arrive at the net debt figure. 

 

Nor, of course, do we have to go outside of our own Province to find precedents for this approach. I 

would refer Honourable Members to the numerous budget addresses of two of Saskatchewan‘s best 

known Provincial Treasurers of past years, the Hon. C. A. Dunning and the Hon. W. J. Patterson. As 

long ago as 1919, Mr. Dunning adopted the method of stating the net public debt, as the balance 

remaining after both sinking funds and self-supporting debt are deducted from the gross figure. Some 

twenty years later, this precedent was also followed by Mr. Patterson. 

 

I must admit, Mr. Speaker, that I have not always been in complete agreement with these two 

gentlemen. I should, however, be the last person on earth ever to suggest that either of them attempted to 

mislead the public by the introduction of what certain Liberal critics now refer to as ―fixed-up figure.‖ 

And in this particular matter, I believe the method used by my honourable predecessors was – and is – 

an entirely correct one. Whether it be for purposes of comparison between provinces, or for appraising 

the actual impact of the debt load on our general revenue, it is essential to arrive at a true figure of the 

not dead-weight debt. Several provinces, for example have invested large sums in utilities and other self-

sustaining projects, while others have restricted their capital expenditure to such activities as the 

construction of highways or public buildings which are not self-liquidating. A proper comparison of the 

debt burden can only be made, therefore, on the basis of dead-weight debt. In Saskatchewan, as the 

following table shows, we have been successful in reducing this burden by some 46 per cent in the past 

ten years.

Of the $96,000,000 of self-liquidating debt, $81,400,000 is invested in the power and telephone systems. 

These corporations pay annually to the Treasury sufficient monies to provide for interest and statutory 

sinking fund on this entire amount. Of the balance, $5,800,000 is for advances to other crown 

corporations, which pay to the Treasury in annual profits more than enough each year to provide for the 

outstanding on loans for breaking and clearing. The only other item making up our self-liquidating debt 

is $8,000,000 outstanding on farm loans. This is the only one of the various projects which is not 

completely self-liquidating. But even in this costly venture, we collected last year, about three-quarters 

of the interest required. In recent years, out of other revenues, we have been able to reduced the amount 

of farm loans debentures outstanding, and it will be reduced by a further $1,400,000 in 1954-55. 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

20 

Last year, I announced that we would be levying a full 3 per cent sinking fund on all the outstanding 

bonded debt of the Province. This policy was carried out, resulting in an increase of over $6,000 in our 

sinking funds during 1953-54. This year, the amount estimated for the public debt service is 

$10,485,000 compared with $10,550,000 last year. 

 

The budget will provide $4,730,970 for the redemption of debt maturing during the next year. It will 

also provided for a full 3 per cent sinking fund payment on all the outstanding debentures, thus adding 

$4,923,880 to the sinking funds. It will also provide for interest payments of $7,022,610. 

 

Here, again, the difference between dead-weight and self-liquidating debt becomes perfectly clear. 

These three items just mentioned, when added together, amount to $16,682,460. But $2,538,860 of the 

sinking fund payments and $3,658,350 of the interest payments – over 50 per cent in each case and 

totalling $6,197,210 – will be paid for by self-liquidating projects. Consequently, the burden on general 

revenue is reduced to $10,485,000. 

 

TESTS OF THE BUDGET 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, I well recognize that the budget just presented is a very large one – in fact by a 

substantial margin the most ambitious in our fifty years‘ history. Large as it is, it by no means matches 

the pyramiding rates of increase to be found in the post war experience of some of our sister provinces. I 

suggest, moreover, that the budget measures up well under some important tests. In its revenue basis it 

achieves a working objective of equity and administrative efficiency. In its spending and investment 

aspects, it maintains an essential balance between the needs of public welfare and economic 

development. Taken as a whole, it represents a philosophy of alert and vigorous government activity, 

tempered by a prudence regard for the responsibilities of the future. 

 

I should like to claim for the budget one further advantage – that of flexibility. This is a feature of 

particular importance at this time, having regard to the uncertainty of the economic weather ahead. If a 

severe recession does set in, the budget lends itself to ready modification to meet rapidly changing 

needs. 

 

We should, of course, be loath to reduce the overall level of programming if only because of the part to 

be played by government in combatting cyclical depression. It goes without saying that the prime 

responsibility here rests upon the Federal Government, with its unlimited powers over fiscal and 

monetary policy. Saskatchewan, and no doubt the country as a whole, rightly looks to Ottawa for bold, 

timely and decisive country as a whole, rightly looks to Ottawa for bold, timely and decisive leadership 

in maintaining employment and income at high levels. Certainly, if the need arises, this province is 

prepared to co-operate to the very limit of its fiscal resources in fighting a depression. Fortunately, our 

ability to do so has been greatly improved by the marked economic, social and financial progress 

achieved in the Province during the past ten years. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move that you do now leave the chair.

SECOND READING 

 

Automobile Accident Insurance Act 

 

The Assembly resumed, from March 1, 1054, the adjourned debate on the proposed motion of the Hon. 

Mr. Fines: 

 

―That Bill No. 37 – an Act to amend The Automobile Accident Insurance Act be now read a 

second time.‖ 

 

Mr. Robert Kohaly (Souris-Estevan): — Mr. Speaker, I wish to speak of the principle involved in Bill 

No. 37. I understand it is during the debate on second reading that such matters are discussed. This Bill 

deals with a number of amendments to The Automobile Insurance Act and some of the amendments, as 

indicated by the hon. Minister when the Bill was first placed before us, are only of minor importance. 

They change the words from ‗failure‘ to ‗fracture‘ and so on – of no consequence whatsoever, except to 

make the Act a little bit more workable in the light of day-to-day circumstances. 

 

However, there is a very substantial principle involved in some of the sections of the Bill, namely, the 

sections dealing with property damage insofar as automobile accident insurance is concerned. I don‘t 

want to find myself interpreted as attacking The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, for I am not doing 

so. I am speaking only to the principle of this particular amendment, Bill No. 37. 

 

The hon. members know, better than I, the history of The Automobile Insurance Act; that is, that it came 

about to cover provisions in a legal way for the theory of automobiles and their insurance and allied 

matters in the province of Saskatchewan. It was put together as an experimental matter. It had not been 

tried earlier, and, of course, when you have situations such as that, Mr. Speaker, you find you start with 

something, you add to it and you subtract from it, and the end result with The Automobile Accident 

Insurance Act was that you have a very difficult Act. 

 

Any hon. members of this House who happen also to be members of the legal profession will possibly 

join with me in saying that the Automobile Accident Insurance Act is one of the most difficult Acts to 

administer in a law office. It is very difficult, and we constantly find difficulty in answering questions 

raised by our clients concerning it. So we have certain amendments. 

 

The idea behind this amendment in Bill 37, appears to be to change the coverage or the benefits of The 

Automobile Accident Insurance Act from $100 to $200. Now, generally speaking, I feel that it is the 

opinion of most in the province of Saskatchewan that the financial provisions, or the money provisions 

in The Automobile Accident Insurance Act are, in effect, taxes. We do know that legally they are not. 

They are moved apart from taxes; but they are a form of tax because they are compulsory. People look at 

it in that light. I would be the first to agree that it is in fact not a strict tax, but that is the way our people 

look at it, who are not of course trained in understanding of strict legal terminology. 

 

In Bill 37 we do believe the property damage, but there are other items that are affected. There is, of 

course, the question of collision damage; there is the question of public liability, not to speak of fire and 

theft 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

25 

and so on. And in these three items you have again two branches. The first branch, Mr. Speaker, is the 

question of the premiums or the rates that are to be charged, and the second branch is the benefits to be 

derived from being a member of such a scheme. As far as the premiums or rates are concerned, section 5 

of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act indicates how these rates will be changed or will come 

about. It says very clearly that they shall be published in the ‗Gazette‘ after being fixed by regulation. 

That is section 5, and there is no difficulty with that. But, in Bill 37 we deal with benefits, and benefits 

insofar as collision is concerned are once again dealt with in section 33 of the Act, sub-section 2 which 

gives the right to amend or change the benefits under collision alone by regulation, which of course is 

quite proper. Public liability, having no deductible but having certain limits only is included in 37, 

sub-section 1(f). And once again they can do that as they so see fit. 

 

However, property damage included in Section 37, sub-section 2, of The Automobile Accident 

Insurance Act, there is a noticeable departure from the methods by which benefits can be changed. The 

hon. members will notice that the Legislature in its wisdom has given to the Government the right to 

change the premiums or rates and some of the benefits by regulation, but they fail to do so when it 

comes to the property damage item. It is that part of Bill 37 which makes the most dramatic change in 

principle. It is well understood that property damage is the damage which is done to someone else‘s 

property; collision is the damage which is done to your vehicle. Public liability, of course, is the damage 

which you do to someone, some person rather than an inanimate object, and we have property damage 

being dealt with and the change in the benefits. 

 

Now, property damage, if I may say so, Mr. Speaker, is a good social form of legislation; it is a good 

thing to legislate and insure that people have property damage, because it is a protection to the other 

fellow, not to yourself. Collision, of course, is a protection entirely for you, because it is your own 

vehicle that is being damaged; it is your own vehicle that you foolishly roll on a curve. I submit 

generally that it should not be the subject of legislation and compulsion in the province of 

Saskatchewan. Property damage, however, the principle of this Bill 37, is definitely social legislation 

and should certainly be on our statute books, and the Government are most certainly to be commended 

for having put it there at such an early date and having kept it there and having, through Bill 37, shown 

their continued interest in it. 

 

The history of Bill 37 – and I don‘t want to find myself in the position of reading a lesson to the 

Government or the members of the Executive Council, because they can teach me a great deal about law 

and about legislatures and about assemblies; but the history of Bill 37 is not a good one. I do not know 

whether or not an order-in-council had been passed; but it was made by the hon. Provincial Treasurer as 

more or less an aside, and I do not know, and, of course, we do not know whether orders-in-council had 

been passed, and they may well have done so. But an order-in-council is something that is not provided 

for in this Automobile Accident Insurance Act and, if it has been done, I suggest that the order-in-

council is entirely improper and should not have been passed. An order-in-council, we have long learned 

in this country, is not a proper thing in a democratic country unless there is a specific urgency or an 

emergency that cannot wait for the legislature to deal with it. Section 37 was passed by this Legislature 

specifically leaving out the right to change this except as a Legislature, and it 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

26 

should certainly follow that procedure in the years to come. 

 

There was no great emergency, I submit, Mr. Speaker, in connection with Bill 37, that an order-in-

council should have been necessary. The Legislature met at an early date in February; there was some 

certain urgency connected with an amendment to The City Act and, in order to face that emergency, the 

Minister in charge took certain steps at the opening of the Session to see that it went through quickly. 

The Automobile Insurance for the current year is not going into effect, as I understand it, until the month 

of April, and there is, therefore, approximately two months for this Legislature to change this Act if such 

change is necessary. So I submit to those who may say that there was an order-in-council, that it was not 

proper to have passed such an order-in-council, that there was no necessity for it and that it should not 

have been done. 

 

It might be said by some that there has been a regulation passed and, of course, that cannot be true. 

There is no evidence of the regulation in the ‗Gazette‘ and, in addition, they have no right to pass a 

regulation. I am quite confident the Government, knowing that they lacked this right, would not do so. 

On top of that we have before us Section 7 of Bill 37 which is asking this Legislature to do the very 

thing that a regulation would have done if they had done it and if they had the right to do it. So it is 

highly improbable that any regulations has been passed. 

 

The first inkling that any member of this House had that any change was contemplated in The 

Automobile Accident Insurance Act by way of Bill 37, was certain press announcements that came to 

our attention, and these press announcements did not tell us what the change was going to be in Section 

37 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act – no! All it said was that the hon. Minister was going to 

make a radio speech on what the changes were going to be in The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. 

That‘s all. And so we find on the 16th of February a speech purportedly made by our Provincial 

Treasurer concerning Section 37 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, and some other matters at 

the same time. The other matters that he dealt with, such as the rates, were perfectly legitimate and 

proper. There is nothing wrong with that at all, because he is allowed to do that by regulation. As far as 

the benefits were concerned, which he dealt with at that time, some of them were all right. The ones on 

collision were all right because it is specifically provided by his Legislature that he has the right to do 

so, because a regulation was apparently passed. But in the case of property damage which he announced 

on that date, it was not proper, because it was not within his power to make such an announcement until 

this Legislature had passed it, and he now brings before us Bill 37 containing the very thing. He is 

asking us now to ratify actually his radio speech, telling the people of this country that they were obliged 

to take our insurance changing the benefits under the property damage. It is an accomplished fact, and 

there is very little that this Legislature can do except say, ―Well, we will have to ratify your radio 

speech.‖ But it is a highly improper thing, and I wish to take this opportunity of drawing it to the 

attention of the House. 

 

The principle is wrong; the principle is wrong in the Bill, and the methods used are entirely incorrect. I 

think, Mr. Speaker, that it is a form of discourtesy to the Legislature to usurp their powers and to go on 

the radio and tell us, and the people whom we represent, that there is going to be a change in The 

Automobile Accident Insurance Act and this is what it is going to be. He does not know that this House 

will ratify this change. It is possible, viewing the Government benches, that he could come to the 

assumption that he had more supporters than the Opposition had, and on an ordinary division he 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

27 

would have sufficient. But, it is an act of discourtesy not only to this side of the House but to his own 

people, his own members of the Government, those sitting on the Government side, to assume that they 

would do that which he had announced on the radio. The suggestion that I would like to make is that, if 

he wants to come into this House and make his announcement and then go on the radio to get a wider 

field and into the hands of the people who need to know, then let him do that. Let him make such an 

announcement in this House (it is not impossible) and then go on the radio and engage radio time for the 

service to be rendered to our people. But that was not done. He ignored this House altogether, and went 

on the radio and told the people exactly what they were going to face. 

 

In addition, I realize that there is an unusual situation here. There is a Crown Corporation involved, and 

Crown Corporations are relatively new things. It will take a little while until we get some precedents 

established, and possibly that is one of the reasons why the hon. Provincial Treasurer decided to bypass 

this Legislature for the time being and go on the radio. If that is the case, it is only a question of 

correcting our precedents and making sure that we do not pass down to other people coming after us, the 

right to go on the radio in connection with Crown Corporations which are in fact part of this 

Legislature‘s work, and announce to them direct. It is especially so in connection with this particular 

item. I said this before: I view this along with most people, in this province, as a form of tax. Legally it 

is not entirely so, but certainly it looks like a tax and it feels like a tax and it acts like one and it smells 

like one and it hurts like one and it must be pretty close to a tax. If that is the case, then I suggest, Mr. 

Speaker, that the right to tax rests only in this House, and if it is a close one, then the hon. Provincial 

Treasurer should not take any chances with it, but should come here once again by way of courtesy, if 

nothing else, and announce the changes here. 

 

There are some Crown Corporations that I would not include in that. I would not include any 

corporation dealing with commodities which are on the open market such as boots and blankets and 

things like that, because the people have an opportunity to switch from the government-owned one to 

something else. They do not have to take it, so it is not a tax. Similarly, transportation. You do not have 

to go on the bus; you can go by train, by car, by plane, or by whatever method you want. So they are not 

taxes either; but this is different, because you must take it. If a person is a driver and presents himself for 

insurance and for a licence, he must take what he gets and, therefore, it is a tax, or at least awfully close 

to it. 

 

I think, Mr. Speaker, that the principle involved in Bill 37 must be carefully looked at not only by 

members on this side of the House, but by members on the other side of the House as well, in all 

fairness. For it is their right, as well as our right on this side, which is being abrogated, and there should 

be at this point some effort on our part to stop this one and to stop any succeeding ones. I am sure that, if 

it is drawn to the attention of the Government, more care will be given on the next occasion to riding 

over, either inadvertently or otherwise, the rights of this Legislature. 

 

I do not want to harp back many years ago to very important changes which came about in our 

parliamentary procedure, such as the Magna Carta, Royalties and Ship Money and all that, but that is 

actually the very crises that is involved here. Some hon. members will remember one of the terms of the 

Magna Carta itself was ―that no scutage or aid shall be imposed in our kingdom unless imposed by the 

common consent of our kingdom‖ – and that, of course, is this Legislature insofar as the province of 

Saskatchewan is

concerned. None whatsoever should be done except that which is done through this Legislature. There 

was a man who tried doing it and although he was a king he ended up without his head. I am quite 

confident that situation should not exist in this province in this day in connection with this Provincial 

Treasurer. But both Government members and Opposition members, Mr. Speaker, are responsible to all 

of the people. It is not the Minister who is responsible to the people, but the Minister through us, to these 

people, and not through the radio, regardless of what the instance may be and how close it might tend to 

be from time to time to the Crown Corporations. 

 

Once again I would like to point out that this situation we had on February 16th is not a new one. We 

had it a few years ago. We had it in the February House in Ottawa, and at that time the Minister of 

Finance, Mr. Abbott, put on a new excise tax and he used the same methods that our Provincial 

Treasurer used. He went on the radio and this was a couple of months (I believe) before he ever went to 

the House of Commons to ask for ratification. At that time certain hon. members of that House saw fit to 

rise in their places and comment on it, on the second reading of the item, and there was one very 

renowned authority on constitutional law who spoke at great length – the then member for Lake Centre, 

now for Prince Albert (Mr. Diefenbaker) – but there were greater authorities, possibly. There was the 

hon. member for Moose Jaw who spoke about it as reported in Hansard, House of Commons, Session 

1948, volume 2, page 1540, and Mr. Thatcher said: ―On November 18 last he imposed by order-in-

council or he applied by notice of some kind, a tax of 25 per cent on a long list of commodities.‖ Mr. 

Abbott interjected: ―No order-in-council, no taxes yet imposed‖; which is not the case here. Then Mr. 

Thatcher went on and this is the important part, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Premier Douglas: — Does my hon. friend say it is not the case here? 

 

Mr. Kohaly: — Mr. Abbott, I understood, is reported in the Hansard to have said: ―No order-in-council, 

not taxes yet imposed‖ to the hon. member for Moose Jaw, and I comment on the side that this is not the 

case in Bill 37, for certain taxes have been imposed. People today, yesterday and the day before have 

been buying licences and insurance, and taxes have been imposed by virtue of that, although this Bill 37 

has not yet been passed. I commented as an aside on it, and I should probably have got a little further 

away from the quoted material. Mr. Thatcher proceeded: 

 

―Parliament was not in any way consulted about those facts. Parliament has not approved that tax 

even tonight, yet the tax has been collected by the Minister‘s officials for over two months. What 

is the significance of that? It means that executive government, as represented by the Minister, 

by his officials, by his assistants, most of who are not members of Parliament, have imposed a 

tax on Canadians arbitrarily and autocratically. The Minister is only asking Parliament for 

approval two months after the tax went into effect. I suggest that if this resolution goes through, 

perhaps a few years from now the Government will decide that it can put through taxes without 

even bothering to come to Parliament, before the people. Surely this is conceivable. If this 

resolution is passed, we shall have created a precedent which will mean that in the future the 

Government will be able to impose taxes and then 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

29 

three months, or six months after, come to Parliament and say, ‗We have imposed these taxes; 

will you approve of them‘.‖ 

 

That is not my quotation, but the quotation of the hon. member from Moose Jaw, Mr. Thatcher. In case 

Mr. Thatcher is not an authority on constitutional law and taxes imposed other than through the 

parliament of the country, we have the hon. member for Winnipeg North, Mr. Knowles, who spoke on 

this matter, and he is reported in Hansard of March 9, 1948, on page 2040, as saying: 

 

―I feel that two things should come out of this experience. First of all, this committee should vote 

down this resolution and show the Minister that he has no right to say that it was assumed that 

Parliament would pass it. I submit that there is too much of this trifling with the constitution. I 

submit that this is just about as serious an issue as has yet faced this Parliament.‖ 

 

And then I cannot help but come back to Mr. Diefenbaker, the hon. member for Lake Centre (as he then 

was) to say that I would like to join with his comments at that time only to the extent that ―we must stop 

this political erosion of democratic rights.‖ That is what he had to say about it and he is an authority on 

constitutional proceedings. 

 

It is not my purpose, Mr. Speaker, to come into this House to criticize and criticize alone. I think it is 

one of my duties, but I have another duty and that is to suggest. And I suggest that, in situations similar 

to this, if they should arise in the future the Minister involved should consider it his duty and his 

courtesy to this Legislature if it is sitting, and should do something about it and report it here, then use 

the radio; not the radio first and allow us to tune in to the radio and hear what we should hear right here. 

 

Crown Corporations, I realize, are slightly different than ordinary taxes, but the compulsion angle tends 

to make them into a form of tax, or a quasi tax, and Crown Corporations are becoming more and more 

an everyday part of our life, and the Ministry should be careful that they do not set up some principles 

concerning Crown Corporations which will allow future governments, which may not be as careful as 

the present one, to deviate even further and an entirely dangerous situation will be set up. The only two I 

can think of which might fall in the same category would be the automobile insurance and the hospital 

levy. Those are the only two I can think of at this particular stage. I would like, but believe I have not 

the right, to speak of removing entirely the collision provisions only from The Automobile Accident 

Insurance Act, rather than merely amend the situation. It is not social legislation, and it is only of benefit 

to the individual who holds that particular policy, and it is not for the benefit of other people. I believe 

also, that some of the other provisions, notable fire and theft, are not social and should be removed. 

 

I have said far more than I intended to concerning this, but I feel it is a question that should be given 

serious consideration by this House. It is a question of principle – both sides. I don‘t know what the 

attitude is of the members of the Government who are not members of the Executive or what they think 

about it, and I thought that I should raise it and they, of course, have the right to take their own 

independent stand on the attitude

taken by the hon. Provincial Treasurer in connection with the announcement of this Bill and the 

principle to the people of this country. I wish only to say that I feel there is a responsibility of the 

Ministers to the Government of this country; there is a responsibility by the Government to the 

Legislature, and there is a responsibility of all of us to defend all of the rights, including the 

constitutional, unwritten rights, of this Legislature. Possibly it does not behoove me well, as a young, 

new member, to attempt to say anything such as I have said this afternoon. However, I have had to say 

it. I feel that there has been a serious breach, and I felt that if I brought it up, the hon. members might 

join with me in suggesting that this breach will not recur, but that it will be brought very closely to the 

attention of the Legislature and of the Minister involved, that it won‘t happen. 

 

I wish to conclude by moving, seconded by Mr. Danielson‖ 

 

That the following words be added to the motion: 

 

―But this Assembly regrets that use was made of facilities outside this Assembly to 

convey a proposed amendment to The Automobile Accident Insurance Act to the citizens 

of this province.‖ 

 

Hon. C. M. Fines (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, this reminds me of Shakespeare‘s play 

‗Much Ado About Nothing‘. May I say, at the outset, that the hon. member has shown, this afternoon, 

that he certainly has very little conception of the work that goes into the preparation of anything as big 

as an Automobile Insurance plan. He apparently does not realize that in order to get the necessary 

application forms printed, to get the necessary licences printed – and remember, there are hundreds of 

different kinds, not just a few; there are actually hundreds of different schedules that have to be printed. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — You must not speak to the motion; you have to speak to the amendment. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — I am speaking to the amendment, nothing but. To do that, Mr. Speaker, it is 

necessary to have that in the hands of the printers months ahead. The printers have had this since back in 

December. They were holding the type, waiting until after 1st February to get it printed. The forms have 

been being printed since 1st February. This is one of the practical problems that my hon. friend does not 

recognize. 

 

Then, too, he says that he doesn‘t know whether an Order in Council was passed or not. Well, Mr. 

Speaker, he should know. It is his duty not only as a member of this Legislature, but as a lawyer who 

gets a free copy of the ‗Saskatchewan Gazette‘ to read it; and if he had read the issue of February 20th, 

he would there see the Order in Council which sets out the fee for every type of vehicle, which has been 

passed. 

 

May I say, at the outset, that Cabinet did not exceed its authority in any way, shape or form in setting 

those out, because it states very clearly in sub-section 2 of section 33 that this shall be fixed on 

regulations and then again, sub-section 2 of section 5: ―The premium rates for each licence year shall be 

fixed and shall be published in the ‗Saskatchewan Gazette‘ before the commencement of that licence 

year.‖ That is another good reason: These licences can be used on the 1st of March. We have to get these 

out to 600 issuers in the province from the 15th of February to the 20th to be ready 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

31 

on time. Then too, I would draw your attention to section 64, which says: ―The Lieutenant-Governor in 

Council may make regulations for the better carrying out . . .‖ In other words, the Lieutenant-Governor 

in Council is quite clearly given the powers, all the powers, for fixing the rates and fixing the benefits, 

with this one exception: ―To increase in the province of Saskatchewan the deductible under the property 

damage from $100 to $200.‖ I suppose that will cost less than one-tenth of one per cent of the total 

amount of the Automobile Insurance claims during the next year; so that it is truly much ado about 

nothing. 

 

Then, too, the hon. gentleman says that people say that these insurance fees are taxes. ―Well, I don‘t 

agree with that,‖ he says; although later on he came around and told us that he did agree. I wrote down 

what he said at the start and he seemed to contradict himself as he got more worked up, as he went on. 

Well now, Mr. Speaker, there is no tax to it, whether the hon. gentleman agrees with what he thinks the 

people believe or not. The hon. member for Arm River (Mr. Danielson), when this Bill was introduced 

originally, said that 90 per cent of the people disagreed with the principle of compulsory insurance at all. 

I don‘t think it makes any difference whether the hon. gentleman agrees or not. I am going to tell you, 

today, it is not a tax; there has never been a single five-cent piece of this revenue come into the Treasury 

of the province; under The Treasury Act, every cent in taxes must go into the consolidated fund, and it 

doesn‘t, then something serious can happen. But I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, there has not been a 

five-cent piece come into the consolidated fund from The Automobile Insurance Act. 

 

I am not going to debate the question of whether or not we should have collision insurance. That is not 

the matter before us here today; that is completely outside the realm of this Bill. The other day I didn‘t 

speak on the Bill, because I realized that the Bill was largely technical amendments, and only this one 

slight amendment was a matter of principle. Mr. Speaker, I submit to you that it was impossible to wait. 

I could have got up on the Orders of the Day and said, ―Mr. Speaker, we are going to amend Section 37 

to change the amount under the property damage from $100 to $200 deductible; I am making a radio 

broadcast tonight but please, I want to tell you before I do it.‖ Well, how ridiculous can you get – how 

ridiculous can we get! 

 

I have been in this House, Mr. Speaker, for ten years and I do not think that any member can accuse me 

of showing any discourtesy to the hon. members; in fact I have gone out of my way to try to help them, 

to give then information and to give then all the assistance I possibly can. I have gone beyond what is 

necessary in the line of duty to do that, and I certainly intend to continue that policy. I am sorry I have 

offended my hon. friend, but I am sure that if he had read his ‗Saskatchewan Gazette‘ and read the other 

sections of the Act and had known what the technical difficulties were and how essential it was, he 

would realize that one of the things that worried me about this was leaving it as late as we did to make 

the announcement. Last year, we made the announcement about the 27th of January, 2½ weeks earlier 

than we did this year. Leaving it that late made it very difficult. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, having made this explanation I suggest that probably the hon. member would want to 

withdraw that amendment. 

 

Mr. A. Loptson (Leader of the Opposition): — Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a comment on that 

and support my hon. friend, the member for Souris-Estevan, in his objection to the way the Provincial 

Treasurer handled it. He could have made all these preparations 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

32 

in quite the same way as he did, even without passing an Order in Council. He could have brought the 

Bill in with the Bill that was passed here the first two or three days of the Session, the one respecting 

The City Act, and all this would not have happened. There is no question about it, the Provincial 

Treasurer just flouted the Legislature. As far as the Legislature was concerned he took it for granted his 

supporters were going to carry it – as they always do. All he has to do is snap his finger and they fall in 

line, and my hon. friend from Souris-Estevan will realize that after a while, as we have realized it in the 

past. 

 

Mr. G. Herman Danielson (Arm River): — Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a word or two on this. 

The Provincial Treasurer is an artist at trying to slip from under anything that is not just right. He 

mentioned certain dates. This Bill came out on the 20th of February, and I looked at the ‗Gazette‘ and 

this change with regard to the deductible was not in it. But the radio address was made on February 

16th, Mr. Speaker, four days before the ‗Gazette‘ came out. Then the House met on February 11th, and 

if there was anything in the world that needed to be told to this House (he is a sort of a Caesar when it 

comes to these tings) this is it. The documents are before you. You had another Bill which it was 

necessary to bring up early in the Session and the same could just as well have been done with this one. 

One of the very first things we did was pass a Bill on the request of an urban municipality; and that was 

all right. But every word that the member for Souris-Estevan said is true, and the meaning of it is far, far 

more serious than what the Provincial Treasurer is trying to brush off by waving his hands over there. 

We can expect it on this side of the House, but how those fellows sitting over there can take it, I don‘t 

know. They are getting used to it by this time I guess, and maybe they like it. 

 

I am certainly supporting the member for Souris-Estevan in what he has said and we are not the only 

ones; there are people out in the country. Somebody asked me about this thing. I was sitting down in a 

restaurant and a man who lives in the city of Regina in the Grenfell apartments asked me, ―What are you 

doing with this thing? You are increasing the deductible under the Act.‖ ―Well,‖ I said: ―I never heard of 

it; where did you find it out?‖ He said: ―It was on the radio and my wife was telling me.‖ So it is not 

only of interest to members of this House but it is of interest to every citizen, particularly the farmer, 

who is going to get it in the neck worse than he ever got it before. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! You must confine yourself to speaking to the amendment. 

 

Mr. Danielson: — We‘ll thresh it out, Mr. Speaker, when we get to Committee. 

 

So the Provincial Treasurer has not defence, and the defence that he has put up is nothing more than a 

smokescreen. He hasn‘t got the backing of any document for a word he said. 

 

Mr. R. A. Walker (Hanley): — Mr. Speaker, a couple of members on the opposite side have had 

something to say, wondering what members on this side feel about it. Well, I am going to tell you, Mr. 

Speaker, just how . . . 

 

Mr. Loptson: — You don‘t need to waste your time; we know how you feel. 

 

Mr. Walker: — The member for Souris-Estevan quoted lengthy authorities from the debates of the 

House of Commons of Canada dealing with a situation 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

33 

which, I submit, was quite different from the situation that prevailed here. In the instance about which 

the member complained the Minister had imposed a tax and had collected the tax for several months 

before Parliament was even summoned; and there the tax had been taken into the Federal Treasury 

before Parliament had even been officially advised of the intention of the Government to impose the tax. 

 

Here, however, this situation was distinctly different. In the first place, the legislation was introduced 

into the Legislature before any part of it became operative for this year. This legislation was introduced 

before the first of March, and I suggest that it was the adjournment of the debate by the member for 

Souris-Estevan that prevented this legislation from being disposed of in the ordinary course of events 

and probably passed before the first of March. However, I do not begrudge the hon. member the right to 

ask for an adjournment to discuss the matter, but I do suggest that it ill lies in his mouth to complain, 

because the debate was adjourned over the first of March, that somehow something unconstitutional has 

taken place. 

 

I am sure the member for Souris-Estevan will cede that the only effective part of this legislation which 

affects this 1954 insurance coverage is that which increases the exemption, because, as he admitted, it 

increases the exemption for property damage only; but, as he admitted, the Government has, under the 

existing legislation, the right to set the rates by Order in Council. I suggest that the payments out of the 

fund under the collision or property damage features of the Act have not gone into effect and will not go 

into operation until the first of April – not a single payment out will be governed by this change in the 

exemption until nearly a month hence, so that the objection which the hon. member took to the Act is 

one which, I submit, is entirely invalid. But considering the general principles involved, Mr. Speaker, 

here are Ministers who have gone out on platforms in Saskatchewan and in radio addresses and have 

said that they are going to carry out a $75 million highway programme in the next four years. They did 

that before this Legislature was even elected. Is anyone suggesting that the Minister of Highways, or that 

other speakers on this side of the House who said that this Government was going to carry out and 

implement a $75 million highway programme in the next four years were somehow guilty of contempt 

of this Legislature? I suggest that that is . . . 

 

Mr. Loptson: — Mr. Speaker, I suggest that he keep to the resolution. 

 

Mr. Walker: — I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that it is a common occurrence for this Government to say in 

advance what it is going to do and then to do it. 

 

If the Provincial Treasurer, having announced the Government‘s intention of doing these things, should 

fail to obtain a majority of votes in the Legislature, I am sure that nobody on the other side would grieve 

to see him turning in his office key, so that the constitutional remedy is available to this Legislature if it 

disagrees with the principles contained in the Bill. 

 

I do not want to take time to discuss what the member for Arm River had to say, except that I believe as 

legal counsel for the Liberal Party, we can expect some very quaint legal pronouncements from him. 

The hon. member for Arm River suggests that is now a constitutional principle that you cannot even 

pass an Order in Council if you have mentioned it four days earlier over the radio. I suggest, Mr. 

Speaker, . . . 

 

Mr. Danielson: — That‘s a lie. 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

34 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! 

 

Mr. Danielson: — And you know it. But that is the practice; he couldn‘t even talk for five minutes 

without lying. I never made that statement. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! I insist on order, please. I will ask the member for Arm River to withdraw that 

statement and I will also ask the member for Hanley to withdraw the statement which he ascribes to the 

member if the member says he did not make the statement. 

 

Mr. Walker: — Mr. Speaker, I have no hesitation in accepting the explanation of the hon. member for 

Arm River that he did not make the statement; but I guess what I said was that it was improper to pass 

an order-in-council unless you have announced it previously over the radio. I will withdraw that 

statement and instead I will say that it is improper to announce over the radio five days before what you 

are going to pass by order-in-council. I would like to ask the hon. member to withdraw. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — I think I will ask the hon. member that he be satisfied with the withdrawal of the hon. 

member – that he did not make that statement. 

 

Mr. Danielson: — Mr. Speaker, there is nothing to withdraw if he took back what he said. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Well, he did. 

 

Mr. Danielson: — Well, that‘s all right then. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — You will withdraw too. 

 

Mr. Danielson: — I am going to take back the accusation I may have implied. I am going to say this: I 

am going to give him an opportunity to take it back, too . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! Order! 

 

Mr. Danielson: — . . . but I have the courage to face . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! Order! Will the hon. member sit down? 

 

Mr. Danielson: — Well, Mr. Speaker . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker: — We cannot debate these points of order in this way. 

 

Mr. Danielson: — Why did he have the right to explain? He did explain. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — No, the hon. member for Hanley recited what he had said. He said if you said he didn‘t 

say it then he withdrew. 

 

Mr. Danielson: — Oh, he said many things beside that. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Will the hon. member kindly finish? 

 

Mr. Walker: — Mr. Speaker, I will insist upon the member for Arm River withdrawing the epithet 

which he threw at me. 



 

March 3, 1954 

 

 

35 

Mr. Speaker: — He did withdraw. 

 

Mr. Walker: — Oh, did he withdraw? 

 

Mr. Danielson: — Mr. Speaker, I did withdraw, but he said he never said – he admits that I maybe did 

not make the statement, but he did. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — He has withdraw and you have withdrawn so now let us proceed. 

 

Mr. Walker: — Your honour, I will in future try to avoid noticing the hon. member for Arm River, or 

try to avoid his arguments; but I want to say on my own behalf that I do not feel the conduct of the 

Minister in this regard has in any way jeopardized the constitutional rights of this Legislature or the 

privileges of this side of the Legislature, and I for one want to compliment him for the efficient way in 

which he has conducted this particular matter. 

 

The question being put on the amendment, it was negatived on recorded division by 36 votes against 9. 

 

Mr. R. A. Walker (Hanley): — Mr. Speaker, I beg leave to adjourn the debate on the motion for 

second reading of Bill No. 37. 

 

(Debate adjourned) 

 

The Assembly then adjourned at 6 o‘clock p.m.
