LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Second Session — Fifteenth Legislature 

14th Day 

 

Friday, February 25, 1966 

 

The Assembly met at 2:30 o’clock p.m. 

on the Orders of the Day. 

 

REPLY RE REPORT OF HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY COMMITTEE 
 

Hon. D. V. Heald (Attorney General): — Mr. Speaker, before Orders of the Day, I would like to reply 

to the hon., the senior member from Moose Jaw (Mr. W. G. Davies) who yesterday inquired as to when 

hon. members would have in their possession a copy of the interim report of the Legislative Committee 

on Highway and Traffic Safety. I have issued instructions for Xerox copies to be made available 

forthwith. However, the formal final copy is in the hands of the printers and will not be available for two 

or three weeks’ time, but you will have the mimeographed copy within the next day or two. 

 

STATEMENT RE FINAL WHEAT PAYMENT 
 

Hon. D. McFarlane (Minister of Agriculture): — Mr. Speaker, I wish to make an announcement which 

will be of interest to members of the legislature, the final payment on wheat delivered to the Canadian 

Wheat Board during the 1964-65 crop year amounts to $200,170,082. This was announced by the hon. 

Mitchell Sharp, Minister of Trade. The producers delivered a total of 523,703,180 bushels to the Wheat 

Board in the last crop year. This included 31,529,697 bushels of Durum wheat. The rates of final 

payment for the principal grades of wheat are as follows: No. Manitoba Northern — 38.296 cents, No. 2 

Manitoba Northern — 38.711 cents, No. 3 — 36.228 cents, No. 4 — 36.888 cents, No. 5 — 44.022 

cents, No. 6 — 46.426 cents, Feed Wheat — 47.638 cents. Prices for Amber Durum Grades, No. 1 CW 

Amber Durum — 38.296 cents, No. 2 Amber Durum — 39.169 cents, No. 3 - 38.939 cents, Extra No. 4 

— 39.939 cents, No. 4 — 39.734 cents, No. 5 — 45.012 cents, No. 6 — 46.426 cents. The average final 

payment for wheat other than Durum is 38.12 cents per bushel. Average final payment for Durum is 

39.57 cents a bushel. 

 

The Wheat Board, may I inform the legislature, was to start issuing final wheat payment cheques today. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. I. C. Nollet (Cut Knife): — Mr. Speaker, could the hon. member tell us if he has the figures as to 

what the average price was, the total price for No. 1,2,3, etc.? 

 

Mr. McFarlane: — I haven’t those figures with me this afternoon. 

 

An Hon. Member:  How about $2? 

 

Mr. McFarlane: — The figures today are over $2.02 a bushel.

474 

Mr. Nollet: — Basis Fort William, Mr. Speaker? 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! 

 

STATEMENT RE MOTOR VEHICLE LICENSES 
 

Hon. W. Ross Thatcher (Premier): — Mr. Speaker, as Provincial Treasurer, I would like to announce a 

number of minor changes in the schedule of motor vehicle license fees for 1966-67, which have been 

made. In a general way these schedules will be the same as last year; however, there are some minor 

reductions. A new license classification, Class SB has been established for school buses. There is no 

change in the fees for regular school buses. However, converted trucks will not be required to register in 

the school bus district, if the vehicle is used to transport school children under contract. Farmers who 

own power-units, semi-trailers which are used solely in connection with their own farming operations, 

will be permitted to register under class R, instead of class C commercial. The schedule of fees under 

class R has been extended to include gross weight from 42,000 to 74,000. For example, class R fees 

established for a regular power unit is registered in the 42,000,44,000 gross weight category as $35, or a 

reduction of 82 per cent compared with the class C fee of $190. Class A and Class E public service 

vehicles will be combined in the one class. The fee for the combined class will be at the level of present 

class B fees. This is a reduction of $50 per truck, presently registered in class A. 

 

Passenger vehicles, 30 years or older, sometimes known as antique cars, will pay a reduced annual fee of 

$5, regardless of the wheel base, compared to the present fees of $10, $15 and $20. 

 

The new schedule of fees will go into effect on March 15th. These changes in the schedule of motor 

vehicle license fees will reduce revenues to the Treasury Department by somewhat under $100,000. 

 

Mr. W. S. Lloyd (Leader of the Opposition): — Mr. Speaker, before Orders of the Day, I wonder 

whether the Premier will tell us whether it is correct that Superannuation Funds under the control of the 

government are being directed to purchase substantial amounts of Saskatchewan Savings Bonds. 

 

Mr. Thatcher: — No, I would say that statement is not correct. They are purchasing some, but it will be 

a modest sum. 

 

ANNOUNCEMENT RE SIGNING OF CONTRACT WITH IBEW BY SPC 
 

Hon. D. Steuart (Minister of Public Health): — Mr. Speaker, I know all members will be interested to 

learn that today the Saskatchewan Power Corporation signed a contract with the International 

Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Since they have previously signed with the Oil, Chemical and 

Atomic Workers, this completes all the negotiations they had with the corporation at the present time. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

475 

STATEMENT RE POINT OF PRIVILEGE — RADIO TIME 
 

Hon. J. W. Gardiner (Minister of Public Works): — Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day, I 

would like to bring to the attention of this House on a point of privilege, to info carried in weekly 

newspapers in the province with regard to procedures of the legislature and particularly to info coming 

from the legislature and from the government as such. 

 

Here are some interesting answers reported to have been given by the government to the House during 

the session. First, that the expenses of cabinet ministers traveling outside the province of Saskatchewan 

are $30 per day, which of course is incorrect. The expenses of cabinet ministers traveling outside the 

province is $20 per day and not $30. The second error which is claimed to appear in the records of this 

House, which every member knows it does not, has to do with the radio time in the legislature, where it 

says: 

 

Incidentally when Conservative leader, Martin Pederson, spoke in the Throne Speech debate, he 

said he was on the air only because the CCF had allowed him to use 15 minutes of their time. 

Government members protested this statement, but the records show that the time did, indeed, 

come from the CCF. 

 

I want, Mr. Speaker, for your information, and for the House, to point out that the records of this House 

will actually show Mr. Pederson receives his regular 21 minutes as other members but the opposition 

gave five minutes of their time to Mr. Pederson and the government gave four minutes of their time. 

This is the only record I know of that is on the records of this House. It is quite easy to see when you go 

to the bottom line in this press release, which looks like an ordinary release put out by a writer in this 

province, probably purporting to be from the press gallery, that this article, this particular article is 

authorized by the Saskatchewan CCF party. So I just want to point out that this information is incorrect, 

is false, and is now going out through the weekly papers of this province. I just want to bring to your 

attention that false information is going into the papers of this province, purportedly coming from the 

legislature. 

 

Mr. Lloyd: — Mr. Speaker, on the point of privilege, the loader of the Conservative party in this House 

is well qualified to speak for himself, but he knows, and certainly the Leader of the House for the 

government side knows why the Conservative member got any time at all in the debate . . . 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Steuart: — Because we believe in democracy and gave it to him . . . 

 

Mr. Lloyd: — Under duress. 

 

MESSAGE FROM HIS HONOUR THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR 
 

Hon. W. Ross Thatcher (Premier and Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, I have a message 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

476 

from His Honour the Lieutenant Governor. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — His Honour the Lieutenant Governor, R. L. Hanbidge, transmits estimates of certain 

sums required for the services of the province for the twelve months ending March 31st, 1967, and 

supplementary estimates of certain sums required for the service of the province for the twelve months 

ending March 31st, 1966, and recommends the same to the consideration of the legislative Assembly. 

 

Mr. Thatcher (Provincial Treasurer) moved, seconded by the hon. Minister of Health (Mr. Steuart): 

 

That His Honour’s message, the estimates and supplementary estimates be referred to the 

Committee of Supply. 

 

Motion agreed to. 

 

BUDGET DEBATE 
 

Mr. Thatcher (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, this will mark the second occasion on which it 

has been my privilege, to present a budget on behalf of the new Liberal government. 

 

I make the Motion of Supply as Provincial Treasurer. 

 

In government, budgeting is our main administrative discipline — the process by which the government 

plans for and ensures, the wisest and best use of public monies. 

 

In formulating the budget, two factors much be kept in balance. 

 

On the one hand, the treasury must keep spending at a maximum, on essential services — such as 

highways, education and health — if our economy is to advance. 

 

Even with the most diligent control over expenditures, we must provide substantial additional funds 

each year, to keep pace with the growth occurring within our borders, and to meet the new needs of our 

people. 

 

On the other hand, no responsible government can forget that every dollar it spends, must first be taken 

from a taxpayer — whether individual or corporate. 

 

Consequently, there are financial limitations upon what can be undertaken in any single year. 

 

In preparing the budget, literally hundreds of appeals must be considered, and dozens of spending 

proposals carefully weighed. 

 

The final result — provides the necessary but agonizing confrontation, between available financial 

resources on the one hand — and goals and aspirations on the other. 

 

The duty of the Treasurer, is to take the available revenues, and within their limitations, establish 

priorities for the various spending programs. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

477 

About 75 years ago, a British Prime Minister, the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone, pointed out that 

the principles of sound public finance include: 

 

-economy; 

-a balanced single budget in each year; 

-and a redemption of debt. 

 

I believe that in normal times, the principles enunciated by Mr. Gladstone still are valid. 

 

Certainly, as Provincial Treasurer, I would be opposed to deficit financing at a time when our economy 

is buoyant. 

 

The budget which I am placing before the House this afternoon, endeavours to present a clear picture of 

the present financial position of the province, and the plans of the government for the coming fiscal 

year. 

 

In preparing the 1966 budget, I have kept several factors in mind: 

 

(1) The election promises made by the Liberal party in the last election. 
(2) The belief of the government, that taxes in Saskatchewan are still dangerously high, as 

compared to other parts of Canada. 

(3) That some additional assistance must be found to help our local governments. 
(4) That help and assistance to private enterprise is the most effective way to open up and 

develop our province. 

(5) That much remains to be done to improve living standards for our people. 
 

At all times, our government intends to continue nourishing and improving the investment climate in 

Saskatchewan. 

 

We shall constantly seek to find better methods of attracting new capital. 

 

By such methods, we hope to widen and expand the overall tax base. 

 

THE SASKATCHEWAN ECONOMY 
 

Mr. Speaker, at this point I wish to review briefly the activities that have highlighted the Saskatchewan 

economy over the past year, and outline some of our hopes for the year ahead. 

 

The main economy feature of 1965, of course, was the fact that we had the third largest wheat crop in 

our history. 

 

This gigantic crop amounted to some 420,000,000 bushels, and virtually every bushel has been sold. 

 

As a result, gross agricultural produce in 1965 should reach the $1,000,000,000 figure. 

 

For our farmers, the crop year provided net farm income that 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

478 

exceeds by 34 per cent, the five-year average income from 1961 to 1965. 

 

1966 AGRICULTURE PROSPECTS 
 

What about agricultural prospects? 

 

The world population explosion appears unabated. 

 

Thus, we expect the export demand for grain will continue high. 

 

The huge sales negotiated with Russia and Mainland china provide cause for real optimism in 1966. 

 

Most authorities feel that grain prices will continue steady in 1966. 

 

The heavier than usual snowfall which we have experienced this winter, should help to ensure good 

moisture conditions for the coming crop year. 

 

The cattle industry has made steady progress during 1965, and is in a very healthy position. 

 

Prices are favourable, and prospects are even better. 

 

I regret to say, however, that despite the highest prices in several decades, hog production has continued 

to drop in Saskatchewan. 

 

As I explained earlier this session, the government is taking the initiative in encouraging sheep 

production — which we believe holds possibilities for further increasing farm profits. 

 

AGRICULTURAL SPENDING 
 

Liberals believe that agriculture will continue to remain the major foundation of the Saskatchewan 

economy. 

 

During a former debate, I outlined a series of steps and new programs which the government has 

designed to help farmers. 

 

I shall not repeat those measures in this speech. 

 

However, I may say that in 1966-67, this government will spend a net amount of  -------- $12,300,000 

for agricultural programs (capital and ordinary) — which is the highest expenditure on such programs in 

the history of the province. 

 

This sum represents 20 per cent increase over the current year’s approved budget of  ---- $10,300,000 

 

NON-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 
 

In the non-agricultural sector of the economy, our province again established many new records. 

 

Total public and private investment rose to 
—

$905,000,000 an increase of approximately  - 7 per cent 

 

Construction activity set a new high, advancing over 10 per cent to ------------------------ $515,000,000 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

479 

7,475 new homes or dwelling units were commenced in Saskatchewan, during 1965, as compared to 

7,130 in 1964, an increase of  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 4.8 per cent 

 

Electric power generation increased about 13 per cent in the current year. 

 

Retail trade, according to the latest estimates, rose by  -----------------------------------------  5.7 per cent 

to an all-time record of  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- $1,220,000,000 

 

The value of mineral production continued to advance and reached an estimated  -------- $327,000,000 

an increase of 12 per cent over a year ago. 

 

Manufacturing increased to  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- $427,000,000 

 

However, we do not consider this figure to be either adequate or satisfactory. 

 

The government is taking all possible steps to stimulate and encourage the establishment of secondary 

industries in Saskatchewan. 

 

PERSONAL INCOME 
 

As a result of our very large wheat crop and the boom in the industrial sector of the economy, personal 

income to Saskatchewan citizens reached an all-time high of  ---------------------------- $1,880,000,000 

in 1965, 18 ½ per cent above the 1964 figure. 

 

On a per capita basis, personal income in Saskatchewan is now above the national average in Canada. 

 

In summary, Mr. Speaker, 1965 was a year of new firsts and records for our province. 

 

And, although it is difficult to predict the outcome of the 1966 crop year, the 12 months ahead show 

every indication of continuing the boom trend in our province. 

 

FISCAL POSITION 1965-66 
 

In my first Budget Speech of one year ago, I forecast a modest budgetary surplus of about  - $250,000 

 

Honourable members will recall that revenue estimates were based on: 

 

(a) an average crop; 
(b) an increase in the growth of the Gross National Product of 5 per cent to 6 per cent and; 
(c) a modest expectation of oil exploration activity. 

 

With the buoyant state of the national and provincial economy, revenues are expected to be substantially 

in excess of the amount forecast. 

 

ANTICIPATED REVENUES 
 

Present indications are that revenues in the current 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

480 

fiscal year will exceed the estimates by over  ---------------------------------------------------- $26,000,000 

 

Sales tax receipts will exceed the original estimate of $39,300,000, by more than  ---------- $4,000,000 

 

Gasoline tax receipts should reach $29,700,000, - $700,000 above the original estimate. 

 

Bonus bids are likely to reach an all-time high of up to $13,000,000, some  ------------------ $9,500,000 

above the original. 

 

Based on current revised federal estimates, receipts under the federal-provincial tax collection 

arrangement are expected to be up by  -------------------------------------------------------------- 10,500,000 

over the original estimate of $63,400,000. 

 

Motor vehicle revenues should reach $10,000,000 this year, about  ------------------------------- 400,000 

above the original estimate. 

 

SUPPLEMENTARY EXPENDITURES 
 

Much of this increased revenue will be used to advance capital projects. 

 

We have asked the Department of Highways to proceed with its capital program as rapidly as possible. 

 

This expansion has been limited only by the availability of contractors and the inclement weather. 

 

The department estimates it will over-expend its 1965-66 capital budget by  ----------------- $5,000,000 

 

The Department of Agriculture has been authorized to acquire any land for the South Saskatchewan 

Irrigation project which has been offered for sale. 

 

$900,000 has been approved for this purpose, in addition to the amount provided in the budget. 

 

The Municipal Road Assistance Authority’s budget will be over-expended by  --------------- $900,000 

 

Of this amount, municipalities will receive  ---------------------------------------------------------- $700,000 

 

The House will be asked to provide  ----------------------------------------------------------------- $1,700,000 

towards meeting the province’s commitment for the construction of the civic auditoria in Regina and 

Saskatoon, and the centennial project in Moose Jaw. 

 

We intend to advance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $100,000 

for the detailed planning of the proposed extension of the University Hospital, Saskatoon, and $400,000 

for the planning of the South Saskatchewan base hospital in Regina. 

 

The House will be asked to approve again this year an advance capital grant of  ------------ $3,000,000 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

481 

to the University of Saskatchewan, and an operating grant of  ---------------------------------- $1,600,000 

 

The reserve balance of the Medical Care Insurance Commission will be increased by a supplementary 

grant of  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $5,000,000 

 

In addition to these major over-expenditures, there are smaller authorized over-expenditures, the details 

of which will be made available in Committee of Supply. 

 

These include items such as: 

 

   cost of printing the revised statutes  ------------------------------------------------------------ $150,000 

 

provincial assistance to establish a new regional library in South-Eastern 

Saskatchewan  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $170,000 

 

-construction grants for homes for the aged  -------------------------------------------------- $400,000 

 

   mineral exploration incentive program  -------------------------------------------------------- $200,000 

 

grant to the Saskatchewan Research Council  ------------------------------------------------- $100,000 

 

   school grants  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $300,000 

 

grant to the Saskatchewan Diamond Jubilee and Canada Centennial Corporation  ----- $300,000 

for the current fiscal year 

 

Having made provision for this total supplementary spending program and assuming that some 

departments, as usual, will under-spend, I estimate that we will end up with a budgetary 

surplus of about  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $6,000,000 

for the current fiscal year. 

 

CROWN CORPORATIONS 
 

I turn now to a brief review and outline of plans for the province’s Crown corporations. 

 

May I reiterate that it is the philosophy of this government to encourage the industrial development of 

Saskatchewan by “private enterprise”. 

 

The establishment and continued operation of a Crown corporation may be justified, in our opinion, only 

if it meets at least one of the following qualifications. 

 

1. If it provides an essential service which private firms are unable to supply at comparable cost to 
the public. 

2. If it provides useful employment which otherwise would not be available. 
3. If it yields a particularly satisfactory return on invested public funds. 

 

During the past year, three Crown corporations which failed to meet any of these requirements were sold 

on favourable terms. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

482 

SASKAIR 
 

The financial picture of government-owned Saskair, from 1948 on, had not in our opinion, been 

satisfactory. 

 

An independent consultant whom we called in, indicated that continued operation would probably 

involve substantial losses to the taxpayer in the future. 

 

We, therefore, entertained offers to purchase, from private firms. 

 

The high bid was made by a group of private businessmen, who formed North Canada Air Limited, a 

new Saskatchewan company, to purchase the assets and business of Saskair. 

 

North Canada Air Limited has undertaken to provide at least the same level of service previously carried 

out in the north, by Saskair. 

 

Moreover, the company plans to expand and improve northern flying services in step with growth in the 

far north. 

 

We are confident that a well-managed private company will be able to operate a profitable air service in 

the north. 

 

The assets of Saskair were sold at a price which realized a net gain for the taxpayer. 

 

The company has indicated that in the past year, it has increased total employment and wages. 

 

In our opinion, it has also improved services. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN GUARANTEE & FIDELITY 
 

We believe we will save the taxpayer huge sums of money in the future by having sold the 

Saskatchewan Guarantee & Fidelity Company. 

 

The Socialists had reported a total profit of  ---------------------------------------------------------- $124,000 

in the last 10 years. 

 

They achieved this figure by a process which was little more than “juggling the books”. 

 

As has already been pointed out by the minister in charge of SGIO, instead of a profit, the company 

actually has losses of about --------------------------------------------------------------------------- $3,500,000 

in the 10-year period — many of them in the State of Montana. 

 

These losses were hidden from the taxpayer by the unbelievable expedient of simply making 

equalization payments, and giving commission-free business from the more profitable SGIO. 

 

Thus, I believe we were fortunate indeed to sell this company to a group of businessmen, headed by Mr. 

Glen Turner of Saskatoon. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

483 

The amount we received from the shares, equalled the net asset value of the company, excluding its 

Saskatchewan operations which were transferred to SGIO. 

 

The new company, which understands the insurance business, is moving vigorously into the competitive 

prairie insurance market. 

 

WIZEWOOD 
 

The Wizewood Plyboard Plant at Hudson Bay theoretically was not a Crown corporation. 

 

However, over the years, the government had advanced so much money to it, that in reality 

Saskatchewan taxpayers owned roughly 70 per cent of the plant, at the time the Socialists left office. 

 

Wizewood was in trouble almost from the day it opened. 

 

In their annual reports, losses of about  --------------------------------------------------------------- $412,000 

were admitted, from incorporation in 1959 to February 28, 1965, the date of sale. 

 

Actually, the deficits far exceeded this sum, because the company simply didn’t charge depreciation. 

 

When depreciation was included, actual losses were about  ------------------------------------- $1,250,000 

 

In the last year, ending October 31, 1964, Wizewood losses were  ------------------------------- $307,500 

 

Obviously, neither the management of the company, nor the CCF-NDP government, knew very much 

about the plyboard business. 

 

Soon after taking office, we made a major effort to salvage the operation. 

 

And, we were fortunate indeed to sell the company to one of the giant timber companies of this 

continent, MacMillan & Bloedel. 

 

They have taken what was virtually a bankrupt company and 

 

— increased production; 

— raised wages; 

— increased employment; 

 

and started to pay taxes to the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT FUND 
 

In the past year, the Industrial Development Fund cleared up the last of its outstanding loans granted up 

until 1963. 

 

Since then, its operations have, in effect, been taken over by SEDCO. 

 

Legislation to abolish the Fund will come before the legislature shortly. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

484 

There are two other Crown corporations which we have been analysing carefully this year. 

 

In the meantime, we have continued their operations as effectively as possible. 

 

While no final decision has been made, I am rather of the opinion that these two operations could also 

probably be carried on more efficiently under private ownership. 

 

ESTEVAN CLAY PRODUCTS 
 

The brick plan at Estevan has had a series of disastrous years since 1961. 

 

In that period of time, losses have exceeded  ---------------------------------------------------------- $33,000 

 

In 1964, the loss was approximately  ------------------------------------------------------------------- $48,000 

 

The government has tried to dispose of the plant without success. 

 

A few months ago, we hired a company known as industrial Management Limited, which is connected 

with IPSCO, to manage the operation. 

 

At the same time, we have made major efforts to persuade schools, hospitals, etc., to use brick from the 

plant. 

 

As a result of these steps, we expect the plant to show a modest profit of about  --------------- $10,500 

in 1965. 

 

In 1966, we expect to show a more substantial profit. 

 

However, we are far from satisfied with the operation, and would sell it to private enterprise if the 

opportunity should arise. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN GOVERNMENT PRINTING COMPANY 
 

The Saskatchewan Government Printing Company has shown modest profits year after year. 

 

Most of the business is given to them by the government, without competition, and without the 

corporation incurring selling expenses. 

 

Since taking office, it has been this government’s policy to distribute more printing among weekly 

newspapers around the province. 

 

Last year, the weeklies received  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $63,000 

 

We doubt whether the government should be in the printing business. 

 

While we have no immediate plans for selling the printing company, we would be prepared to entertain 

reasonable offers from private firms to purchase this corporation. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

485 

SASKATCHEWAN GOVERNMENT INSURANCE OFFICE 
 

Last year, the government removed some of the monopoly advantages enjoyed by the Saskatchewan 

Government Insurance Office. 

 

Schools, hospitals, sanatoria, etc., which previously were obliged to buy their insurance from 

Saskatchewan Government Insurance, have been allowed to buy competitively. 

 

Time and time again, school boards have saved large sums of money as a result. 

 

For example, in Saskatoon, the Government Insurance net big for the School Board 

business was  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ $45,700 

 

A private enterprise company was able to big  --------------------------------------------------------- $35,100 

 

Thus, the taxpayers of that city were able to save  ---------------------------------------------------- $10,600 

because of that competition. 

 

Despite the removal of the monopoly advantages, the corporation has experienced the most profitable 

year in history. 

 

Part of this, is caused by the fact that it is no longer subsidizing the Guarantee & Fidelity Company. 

 

But, part of the profit picture is also due to better management and administration. 

 

It appears evident at this time, that the Saskatchewan Government Insurance office, because of the 

nature of services provided, will be continued. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY 
 

In recent years, with the danger of railway abandonment in some communities, the Saskatchewan 

Transportation Company assumed new importance. 

 

During 1965, by more effective direction, the net profit was  ------------------------------------- $217,000 

 

This compared with  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $167,500 

in 1964. 

 

Because of the services provided to many Saskatchewan communities, the government intends to 

continue the operation of this Crown corporation. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN SODIUM SULPHATE 
 

This corporation has been one of the more lucrative owned by the government. 

 

In the past year, it earned approximately  ------------------------------------------------------------- $855,000 

for the Saskatchewan taxpayers. 

 

In 1966, two and possibly three, new sodium Sulphate mines will come into production, hence the 

Crown corporation will face additional competition. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

486 

This year, the corporation is proceeding with the building of a new plant at Ingebright Lake. 

 

The government authorized this new expenditure, because of the gradual depletion of resources at 

Bishopric and Chaplin. 

 

The government does not rule out the ultimate sale of the company to private enterprise. 

 

However, as long as the picture continues to be so favourable, we contemplate no sale of the plant. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN FOREST PRODUCTS 
 

Many of the monopoly provisions of the Saskatchewan Timber Board have now been removed. 

 

Private enterprise has been invited to establish in our northern areas and is rapidly doing so. This fact 

has affected profits of the Board. 

 

This year, net —profits will be approximately  ------------------------------------------------------ $316,500 

as compared to $507,500 a year ago. 

 

In many areas, operations of the Tiber Board may be phased out as new private companies come in. 

 

However, the corporation will be used in a major way, to gather pulpwood for the new Prince Albert 

Mill. 

 

Thus, we expect in the immediate future, that its overall operations will be expanded, rather than 

contracted. 

 

However, at all times, the corporation will be expected to stand on its own feet. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN GOVERNMENT TELEPHONES 
 

In 1966, Saskatchewan Government Telephones will undertake a  --------------------------- $21,000,000 

construction program. 

 

The government will assist in financing this program, by borrowing ------------------------ $12,500,000 

for the corporation, an increase of $500,000 over 1965. 

 

At the same time the government will change the policy introduced by the previous administration, 

whereby all profits of the corporation are transferred to the Provincial Treasury. 

 

While this previous policy resulted in an increased share of Trans-Canada telephone revenues, the 

proportion of debt outstanding has risen to over  -------------------------------------------------- 85 per cent 

of the total capital structure. 

 

We believe this percentage is too great a debt burden for the Telephone Corporation to carry and is 

contrary to sound business practice. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

487 

The whole capital structure is causing the government major concern. 

 

In future, we believe it is imperative that more development be financed by equity capital, and less by 

borrowing. 

 

Last year, as usual, all profits of the corporation went into consolidated revenue. 

 

This year, the corporation will be permitted to retain  -------------------------------------------- $2,200,000 

 

However, in subsequent years, we hope a greater proportion of profits may be retained. 

 

In line with this thinking, we are seeking a revised formula for sharing of Trans-Canada Telephone 

revenues. 

 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones is rapidly expanding its facilities to meet the growing demands 

of industry and commerce, as well as the personal needs of the citizens of the province. 

 

In 1966  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22 exchange areas 

will be converted to community dial offices. 

 

A start will be made on  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19 more 

for completion in 1967. 

 

In addition, direct distance dialing will be extended to  --------------------------------------------- 2 centres 

 

— Prince Albert 

— North Battleford 

 

Work will be substantially completed on the extension to two more centres 

 

— Yorkton 

— Melfort 

 

By the end of 1966  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 79 per cent 

of the telephones in Saskatchewan will be equipped for direct distance dialing. 

 

The minister in charge of Saskatchewan Government Telephones announced recently, a cost-sharing 

program to provide telephone service to some farms in areas which never have had telephones. 

 

The government intends to extend telephone service to several thousands of persons in Saskatchewan, 

who do not have access to this essential means of communication. 

 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones estimates that the 

total capital costs will be  ----------------------------------------------------------- $6,000,000 to $7,000,000 

to serve an estimated  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 6,000 to 7,000 farm 

families in the province, excluding the far north. 

 

The government has authorized Saskatchewan Government Telephones to spend  ------------ $500,000 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

488 

in 1966, as a start on this new program. 

 

All in all, we continue to feel that Saskatchewan Government Telephones is a well-managed entity. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN POWER CORPORATION 
 

I turn now to the Saskatchewan Power Corporation. 

 

Our government has been very dissatisfied with the rate of return on investment for this utility. 

 

Moreover, we have believed that far too much of the expansion has been financed by borrowing instead 

of through profits. 

 

New management has made some progress to rectify this situation in the past year — though overall 

results are still far from satisfactory. 

 

Surely, it is a reflection on the business capacity of the past 

Socialist government that only  -------------------------------------------------------------------- 7 1/2 per cent 

of this company is owned by the people and  ------------------------------------------------- 92 1/2 per cent 

is owed to bond holders. 

 

This situation is even more ludicrous, when it is realized that a good many of the bond holders are 

Americans. 

 

The Socialists, time after time, criticize this government for selling our resources to United States 

interests. 

 

Yet, during their period of office, they sold $176,000,000 in bonds to United States citizens in order to 

finance SPC operations. 

 

Actually, no one should be surprised. 

 

It is very seldom that the CCF-NDP leaders practice what they preach. 

 

The overall profit picture in the past year has increased from about  --------------------------- $5,100,000 

to roughly  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $8,500,000 

 

In the past year, the cash flow position increased from  ---------------------------------------- $21,000,000 

a year ago, to  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $28,000,000 

 

However, the government does not believe that the overall profit picture can be really improved until 

more of the company is owned by the people, and less by bond holders. 

 

Our government cannot rectify this very uneconomic capital structure overnight, because today we have 

huge new industrial developments in Saskatchewan. 

 

Potash, oil and other commercial enterprises all require vastly increased quantities of electricity and 

power. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

489 

We must continue to supply that energy, even though continued heavy borrowing is required. 

 

However, over the next few years, the government is determined to increase the percentage of equity 

capital. 

 

In 1966, we expect overall power consumption in Saskatchewan to increase by  ------------ 10 per cent 

 

A major expansion program will take place in the current year. 

 

It will include: 

 

1. Installation of two new 40 megawatt units at the Squaw Rapids Plant. 
2. The start of the construction of a hydro electric plant at the south Saskatchewan River Dam, 

and a beginning on the installation of three 62.5 megawatt units to be completed in 1968 and 

1969. 

3. A major expansion of the existing generator capacity at Boundary Dam will be undertaken in 
1966 and completed in 1970. 

 

Investigations are continuing into the feasibility of constructing another hydro dam in the Nipawin area. 

 

GAS 
 

The corporation has negotiation a major long-range gas supply contract with Trans-Canada Pipelines 

Limited, which will serve to meet the growing gas demand. 

 

The corporation has recently concluded negotiations which will result in a major extension of the gas 

system to serve Rosthern-Duck Lake area at an estimated cost of  ----------------------------- $1,750,000 

 

The project will be proceeded with as soon as 65 per cent of the potential customers have signed up for 

gas installation. 

 

The total capital requirements of the corporation for 1966, including debt retirement will amount to the 

staggering figure of  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $73,800,000 

 

$46,200,000 of this amount will be financed through borrowing, while  -------------------- $27,600,000 

is available within the corporation through earnings and provision for depreciation. 

 

It is anticipated that  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $10,000,000 

will be the profit earned by the corporation in 1966. 

 

I might add that this $10,000,000 profit is forecast after making increased provisions for depreciation 

and providing for the higher repayment of foreign borrowing, due to the discount of the Canadian dollar. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

490 

We also intend to reduce the amount of expenses which in the past have been excessively capitalized. 

 

Much of the credit for this improved profit picture, of course, must go to the minister, the Board of 

Directors, the new General Manager, and the management of the corporation. 

 

These people have taken steps, starting with a complete re-organization of the corporation, to effect 

operating economies and improve efficiency within the corporation. 

 

The corporation, during 1965, has reduced staff by  --------------------------------------- 223 or 8 per cent 

 

The 204 staff of the Regina plant, acquired by the corporation, is not included in this figure. 

 

In short, Mr. Speaker, while much remains to be done, I feel that major progress had been made during 

1965, in putting the Saskatchewan Power Corporation on a better business basis. 

 

CAPITAL FINANCING 1965-66 
 

I should now like to say a few words about our “capital financing”. 

 

During 1965, the Province of Saskatchewan borrowed  ---------------------------------------- $34,300,000 

a decrease of  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26,500,000 

from the previous year. 

 

The decrease, of course, was made possible by the buoyant economy, and by the reduction of borrowing 

by the Saskatchewan Power Corporation. 

 

These funds were obtained from the following markets. 

 

$17,200,000 from the Saskatchewan Savings Bond market; 

 

$15,000,000 from the United States long-term Bond market; 

 

$2,100,000 from the sale of a Treasury Bill to the government of Canada (to finance one-eighth of this 

year’s expenditures on the south Saskatchewan River Dam). 

 

With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to include a list of 1965 debenture issues: 

 

DEBENTURES 1965 
 

Date Maturity Coupon Payable Amount 

     

Mar. 15/65 Mar. 15/75 5; 5-1/4 & 5-1/2 Canada $17,218,500 

Oct. 1/65 Oct. 1.90 4-7/8 per cent U.S. 15,000,000 

     

 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

491 

I would like to comment briefly on these two issues of debentures. 

 

Sales of Saskatchewan Savings Bonds (Series No. 5 in 1965) far exceeded all expectations. 

 

Total sales amounted to  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- $17,218,500 

which was the highest amount sold of any issue to date. 

 

In addition, the yield to the investor of  --------------------------------------------------------- 5.148 per cent 

was the lowest yield offered of any issue to date. 

 

Saskatchewan Savings Bonds, Series No. 6, went on sale last Monday, February 21st. 

 

Last year we stated that as a matter of policy, the government should, where economically feasible, 

borrow in the Canadian market. 

 

We were hopeful at that time that the spread in interest rates between the Canadian and United States 

market would be reduced. 

 

Unfortunately, it became apparent in mid year that this spread in interest rates had in fact widened and 

that considerable savings could be secured by Canadian borrowers in the United States market. 

 

As a result of this situation, an issue of ------------------------------------------------------------- $5,500,000 

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 4-7/8 per cent 

debentures, payable in United States dollars was issued on October 1, 1965, at a price to yield 4.95 per 

cent to the investor, compared to 5.78 per cent, if we had borrowed on the Canadian market at that time. 

 

In addition to these debenture issues, the government borrowed  ------------------------------- $4,000,000 

30-year debenture issue of the University of Saskatchewan, to finance part of its capital program. 

 

This issue was dated October 1, 1965, and was privately placed in the Canadian market at a price to 

yield 5.6 per cent to the investor. This was an extremely favourable price. 

 

BOND REDEMPTION 
 

On August 3, 1965, the government redeemed in full $10,000,000 — 6 per cent Province of 

Saskatchewan debentures maturing January 2, 1966. 

 

This was done under the prior redemption provision of the debenture issue and resulted in a saving in 

interest of approximately  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $50,000 

 

Total redemptions of outstanding debt, including 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

492 

the call of the $10,000,000 debenture issue in 1965, amounted to  --------------------------- $18,600,000 

 

SINKING FUNDS 
 

The government continued the policy of paying into sinking funds three per cent of the outstanding debt. 

 

In 1965, $17,540,000 was paid into our various sinking funds. Of this amount, the Saskatchewan Power 

Corporation and Saskatchewan Government Telephones reimbursed the government  --- $16,560,000 

 

A total of $120,100,000 was held in the sinking funds available for debt retirement as at December 31st, 

1965. 

 

PURCHASE OF MUNICIPAL DEBENTURES 
 

In 1965, the government assisted local governments to finance debentures for schools, hospitals, rural 

telephones and municipal self-liquidating projects, including water and sewage projects, and utilities by 

purchasing  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $4,600,000 

of the debentures issued. 

 

This represents 16 per cent of the total estimated  ----------------------------------------------- $29,000,000 

of local government debentures issued in 1965. 

 

The government presently assists local governments, other than the larger cities, which encounter 

genuine difficulty in marketing their debentures, by purchasing up to 50 per cent of an issue. 

 

SOCIAL SERVICES AND HUMAN BETTERMENT 
 

I should like now to discuss some of our specific programs, in the field of social welfare and human 

betterment. 

 

I am sure all hon. members will agree that adequate education, health and welfare programs are vital to a 

dynamic province like Saskatchewan. 

 

The magnitude of our expenditures indicates that we recognize their importance. 

 

EDUCATION 
 

The most costly of these social services and the most important to our future is education. 

 

Enrolment in the elementary and secondary schools of the province now approximates  ------ 238,000 

a substantial portion of our population. 

 

This figure does not include technical, vocational nor university students — nor does it include students 

in federal Indian schools. 

 

Financial requirements for the construction of 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

493 

buildings to accommodate students in schools at both levels, and to provide facilities for vocational 

education in secondary schools, have been particularly heavy. 

 

In the past year, 589 regular new schoolrooms were opened in Saskatchewan. 

 

In addition, another 211 specialized rooms were opened, including science labs, libraries, gymnasiums, 

commercial rooms and others. 

 

In short, the equivalent of 800 new rooms were added to our school system. 

 

On the whole, new construction of elementary and secondary schools has been catching up with the 

requirements imposed by increasing enrolment. 

 

It is expected that expenditures for school buildings will continue at a somewhat lower level for the next 

two or three years. 

 

COSTS OF EDUCATION 
 

However, the overall costs of education continue to rise sharply and apparently inevitably. 

 

In 1966, it is expected that total Saskatchewan school costs will rise by  ------------------- $10,800,000 

to    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $108,400,000 

due mainly to: 

 

— increased enrolment; 

— higher salaries and costs; 

— the employer’s contribution 

— to the Canada Pension Plan. 

 

Most local governments finance educational costs in the main, from a property tax. 

 

Our government is extremely concerned over the alarming increase in property taxes throughout 

Saskatchewan. 

 

In the 20 years following World War II, this levy increased by an average of 400 per cent. 

 

The main responsibility for controlling property taxes must remain with local governments and school 

units. 

 

However, education is so vital to the very future of our province, that the government believes we must 

give priority to a program of increased assistance to local governments. 

 

Total regular school grants in the 1966-67 fiscal, including a small prepayment, will be  $55,100,000 

of which  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $4,800,000 

will be contributed by the federal government. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

494 

Regular provincial grants will, therefore, amount to  --------------------------------------- $50,300,000 net 

an increase of  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $5,000,000 

over the year. 

 

We believe that these increased grants, in a general way, should help our schools to hold their mill rates 

at 1965 levels. 

 

However, we would like to see some reductions made. 

 

Thus, we propose to make an additional  ----------------------------------------------------------- $3,000,000 

available to school units in the form of incentive grants. 

 

This assistance will be contingent upon the boards using the major portion for tax reduction. 

 

We appreciate that this is only an interim measure to help with the financing of public school education. 

 

Our government intends to take early steps to investigate the desirability of establishing a province-wide 

foundation program. 

 

We are also prepared to assume the costs of school boards’ contributions to the Canada Pension Fund. 

 

We estimate that in 1966, this will save local school units an additional  --------------------- $1,000,000 

 

In short, we are increasing total direct school grants this year by  ------------------------------ $9,000,000 

 

The net provincial school grant total of $54,300,000 is  ---------------------------------------- $16,800,000 

higher than the largest total grant ever paid in a single year by the Socialists. 

 

Insofar as the school grant program is concerned, we are proposing to increase the proportion of total 

school costs shared by the senior governments, to  ---------------------------------------------- 54.5 per cent 

 

PRIVATE SCHOOLS 
 

The government, for the first time, began to pay grants to private high schools during 1965. 

 

The plan seems to have been of major assistance to these schools. 

 

In the current budget, we are increasing the amount for the next year $5.00 per student. 

 

Total cost of the program will be  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- $150,000 

 

TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
 

This budget proposes major steps to emphasize and expand the technical and trade training program. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

495 

Such a program is urgently needed in order to create the more skilled labour force demanded by our 

increasing industrialized economy. 

 

In addition, by training our young people in the province, we hope to encourage them to remain in 

Saskatchewan. 

 

In this budget, we have provided for: 

 

(1) An extension of facilities at the Saskatchewan Technical institute, Saskatoon at an estimated 
capital cost of  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $4,000,000 

 

This extension will provide facilities for 750 to 800 more students in the provincial training program. 

 

We are providing  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $2,600,000 

in the public works capital budget for this project, which will be completed in 1967-68. 

 

(2) We are extending the facilities at Moose Jaw Technical Institute to handle another 125 
technology students. 

 

$125,000 is included in the budget for this purpose. 

 

(3) Work has commenced on three new technical vocational schools at Regina, Yorkton and 
Lloydminster. 

 

Technical high Schools are in the active planning stage in the following centres: 

 

— North Battleford 

— Melfort 

— Swift current 

— Prince Albert. 

 

Capital school grants to school boards for expanded and new vocational training 

facilities will total -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $6,100,000 

 

(4) The budget will provide for increases allowances for students in training by 
more than  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $100,000 

 

TEXT BOOKS 
 

In the last election, the Liberal party expressed the view that we should pay the cost of textbooks in 

collegiates and high schools. 

 

The burden of these costs falls very heavily on large families. 

 

The budget is providing for  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- $600,000 

to provide free text books to all students in Grade IX. 

 

Next year we will hope to proceed further in this field. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

496 

UNIVERSITY 
 

The need to provide facilities for higher education is expanding rapidly, and becomes ever more 

pressing. 

 

With the help of substantial government assistance, the size and facilities of both our universities 

continue to increase. 

 

The University of Saskatchewan plans a record 

capital development program this year of  -------------------------------------------------------- $15,000,000 

 

This will be financed mainly from provincial funds as follows: 

 

— a supplementary capital grant this year of  ------------------------------------------------------ $3,000,000 

— a capital grant in 1966-67 of  --------------------------------------------------------------------- $2,000,000 

— loan from the provincial government of  -------------------------------------------------------- $8,300,000 

— carryover  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $1,700,000 

 

Total provincial capital financial assistance in 1966-67 will be  ------------------------------ $13,300,000 

 

For the coming fiscal year, the operating grant to the 

University of Saskatchewan will be  --------------------------------------------------------------- $10,400,000 

($1,600,000 of which will be prepaid in the current fiscal year). 

This figure was made possible only by emergency grants made by the federal government. 

 

Even with federal assistance, the increase is about  ----------------------------------------------- $1,000,000 

over the amount needed last year. 

 

In short, total provincial assistance to the University of Saskatchewan, will reach  -------- $23,700,000 

this year. 

 

I ask the hon. members to note that the highest sum ever given by the Socialists in a single year, to the 

University of Saskatchewan was  ------------------------------------------------------------------ $11,600,000 

the year before an election. 

 

Finding this huge sum, will strain the resources of the government in a major way. 

 

The combined increases in federal and provincial grants should enable the university to accommodate an 

additional 1,250 students, in increase of almost  --------------------------------------------------- 10 per cent 

 

While recognizing their urgent needs because of a burgeoning student enrolment, we have asked the 

university officials to do their best to control costs. 

 

In summary, total government assistance to education 

for the 1966-67 fiscal year, will reach  -------------------------------------------------------- $87,500,000 net 

excluding federal reimbursement. 

 

HEALTH 
 

The second of the social services which is so vitally important to the life of this province, and 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

497 

to which our government will always give its wholehearted support, is the field of health. 

 

To meet the constantly changing needs of more than 950,000 people, health programs cannot remain 

static. 

 

Emphasis must be directed toward modern treatment of the mentally ill, widespread public health 

services, hospital care insurance and Medicare. 

 

Spending on Saskatchewan’s various health programs continues to rise. 

 

I would be less than honest if I did not tell the people of Saskatchewan that these rising costs are 

straining our province’s financial resources. 

 

In the 1966-67 fiscal year, it is expected that total gross spending on public health 

will reach  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $112,200,000 

 

This represents an increase of  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- $10,000,000 

over 1965-66. 

 

It represents an increase of  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- $24,200,000 

over the last year of Socialist Government, during the 1963-64 fiscal year. 

 

The budget provides for next expenditures of  --------------------------------------------------- $63,400,000 

(including prepayments of almost $6,000,000). 

 

The net increase is  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $10,500,000 

over the current year adjusted for prepayments. 

 

For months, the Minister of Health and his department have been working at reducing costs and 

eliminating inefficiencies. They have saved large and substantial sums of money. 

 

The government is also gratified with the efforts made this past year on the part of: 

 

— the Medical Care Insurance Commission; 

— the College of Physicians & Surgeons; 

— the Hospital Boards; 

— the public generally, 

 

to control the costs of our health programs. 

 

Even more, however, will have to be done in this connection during 1966. 

 

In 1966-67 total estimated costs of the hospitalisation plan are  ------------------------------ $59,300,000 

 

This is an alarming 8.4 per cent increase over this year, or  ------------------------------------- $4,600,000 

 

Fortunately, our experience with Medicare in the past year has been quite favourable, as per capital costs 

increased by only  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2.4 per cent 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

498 

In the coming fiscal year, Medicare costs will be  ----------------------------------------------- $24,600,000 

 

We welcomed the announcement made a few months ago that the federal government will soon 

participate in the cost of Medicare. 

 

We hope that such participation may permit us to lower the present premium rate, and to extend 

coverage in the not too distant future. 

 

MENTAL HEALTH 
 

Care of the mentally ill, including the operation of the mental hospitals at 

North Battleford and Weyburn, and of the training schools at Moose Jaw and Prince Albert 

will require over  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $13,200,000 

an increase of  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4.2 per cent 

over the amount appropriated for the current year. 

 

The emphasis on outpatient treatment has meant that this in is substantially less than it might have been. 

 

Not only have economies been realized from this form of treatment, but it has proven to be far more 

effective in a great many cases than treatment within an institution. 

 

HOSPITAL FACILITIES 
 

The provision of adequate hospital facilities for the province requires major expenditure by the 

provincial government. 

 

$3,300,000 dollars will be made available for hospital planning and construction in 1966-67. 

 

Over  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $750,000 

has been provided for the 60 bed Psychiatric Centre at Prince Albert, of which $470,000 was prepaid in 

the current fiscal year. 

 

In addition, $400,000 has been placed in the supplementary estimates for the detailed planning and 

design of a new multi-million dollar base hospital in Regina. 

 

Another $100,000 has also been placed in the supplementaries for the planning of the proposed 

extension and renovation of the University Hospital at Saskatoon. 

 

Grants to municipal hospital boards will permit renovations and extensions of from 20 to 100 beds at 

each of the following hospitals: 

 

— Assiniboia 

— Central Butte 

— Canora 

— Kindersley 

— North Battleford (Notre Dame) 

— Lanigan 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

499 

— Shaunavon 

— Prince Albert (Victoria Union) 

— Preeceville 

— Saskatoon (City Hospital) 

— Spiritwood 

— Wadena 

— Wynyard. 

 

RECRUITMENT OF DENTISTS 
 

The government recognizes the acute shortage of dentists in Saskatchewan, particularly in our smaller 

cities and towns. 

 

Accordingly, we have undertaken a program to encourage dentists from Great Britain and the United 

States to come to Saskatchewan. 

 

An amount of $100,000 has been provided for this purpose, in the hope that a substantial number of 

dentists can be recruited. 

 

It is anticipated that the recently announced plans for a dental college in Saskatoon will to some extent 

encourage more Saskatchewan students to take up dentistry in the province. 

 

CANCER PROGRAM 
 

The government has provided over  ----------------------------------------------------------------- $1,800,000 

for the treatment of those suffering from cancer. 

 

This figure represents an increase of  ------------------------------------------------------------------ $250,000 

over the past year. 

 

Included in this amount is $142,000 to replace and up-date equipment at the Regina and Saskatoon 

Cancer Clinics. 

 

POLIO IMMUNIZATION 
 

A mass polio immunization program will be undertaken, the vaccine for which will 

require the sum of  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $120,000 

to be shared equally with the federal government. 

 

GRANT TO THE SASKATCHEWAN ANTI-T.B. LEAGUE 
 

The government recognizes that the per diem cost of treating tuberculosis patients and the 

municipalities’ share of these costs are rising as a result of the Saskatchewan Anti-T.B. League’s 

successful preventative program. 

 

The government will increase its grant from $4 per patient day to $5 per patient day. 

 

The cost of the increase related to this additional $1 per patient day is  --------------------------- $47,500 

 

The Minister of Health will enlarge on the health programs which I have mentioned today.

WELFARE 
 

Our welfare services are vital and necessary in meeting the needs of those who, for various reasons, are 

unable to provide for themselves. 

 

To this end, we are continually expanding and improving our programs. 

The department has consistently endeavoured to remove from welfare rolls, those who are able bodied 

and in a position to take work. 

 

At the same time, social welfare officials have endeavoured to improve the assistance to those who are 

in legitimate need. 

 

In the coming year, overall gross spending on welfare will increase by  ---------------------- $1,500,000 

to   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $31,400,000 

 

Much of the higher cost will be caused by a six per cent average increase in social aid payments, which 

the government feels is warranted in view of the steadily mounting costs of living. 

 

However, in 1966, the federal government is proposing greater federal participation in social aid costs 

under the proposed Canada Assistance Plan. 

 

Thus, we are able to budget for a decrease of  ------------------------------------------------------- $560,000 

below the 1965-66 budget. 

 

YOUTH AGENCY 
 

Last May 1st, the government established the Provincial Youth Agency, to review existing programs and 

services to young people in this province. 

 

Dr. Howard Nixon, of the University of Saskatchewan, was appointed Executive Director of the 

Agency. 

 

Research assistants were employed, and visited 118 communities. 

 

A Provincial Youth Review Committee was established to conduct public hearings and receive briefs. 

 

We have received a report on the Youth Agency’s findings and recommendations. 

 

The report recommended the establishment of a Department of youth to encourage, foster and promote 

physical, cultural and social activities for the youth of Saskatchewan. 

 

The government has accepted in principle the recommendations of the Executive Director, and has 

decided to proceed to implement the various proposals in stages. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

501 

The agency will operate under the Department of Public Health. 

 

It will have an initial budget of  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $427,000 

and a staff of 17. 

 

The budget and staff of the physical fitness and recreation program of the Continuing Education Branch 

in the Department of Education will be absorbed into the Youth Agency, as well as the budget and staff 

of the summer recreation program carried out at provincial parks by the Department of Natural 

Resources. 

 

We are confident that the youth Agency will co-ordinate community voluntary agencies and government 

departments, in the development of activities to meet the needs of our youth throughout the province. 

 

HIGHWAYS 
 

Our government recognizes the fundamental importance of our highways and roads program in 

promoting industrial growth, and opening up new area of the province. 

 

Thus, since taking office, we have given top priority to road construction. 

 

We believe that the majority of our people are no longer willing to travel on dusty, dirty main routes, 

and want all major routes to be oiled or paved. 

 

In the last election, we promised to spend at least  --------------------------------------------- $175,000,000 

on the purpose of highway assistance over a four-year period. 

 

We hope to overcome the substantial backlog of substandard roads throughout the province. 

 

I remind you that in the last year of CCF government, 

1963-64, total highway spending was  ------------------------------------------------------------ $24,200,000 

 

This year, on our highway program, (with supplementaries), 

we will spend approximately  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- $40,600,000 

 

We have run into some difficulty in expanding our program this past year. 

 

Many contractors simply lacked sufficient equipment. 

 

For 20 years under the Socialists, they had been unable to obtain adequate work. 

 

We also ran into a major shortage of trained personnel. 

 

The Minister of Highways has met on numerous occasions with the Road Builders of Saskatchewan, and 

urged them to purchase more equipment. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

502 

At the same time, we have established a course at our technical schools to train equipment operators. 

 

It is interesting to note that even with the difficulties I have just mentioned, and a rainy summer, 

Saskatchewan moved  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 23,900,000 

cubic yards of dirt. 

 

I have been informed by the department that this figure surpassed both the Manitoba and Alberta 

figures. 

 

In 1966-67 we hope to step up our highway spending very sharply again. 

 

The budget is providing for minimum expenditures of  ---------------------------------------- $47,500,000 

 

If weather and equipment permit, we will put additional sums in the supplementary estimates. 

 

The Minister of Highways will discuss details of our program at an appropriate time, but again I assure 

the House that this government gives highway building a top priority, as we build and develop the 

economy of Saskatchewan. 

 

NATURAL RESOURCES 
 

To enable the province to carry out its important responsibilities relating 

to the conservation and development of our vast natural resources, 

ordinary and capital appropriations, totalling  ------------------------------------------------------ $8,700,000 

will be requested for the fiscal year 1966-67. 

 

This represents an increase of almost  --------------------------------------------------------------- $1,000,000 

over the past year. 

 

I should like to touch upon several items in connection with this department’s spending. 

 

RECREATION 
 

The government feels that, due to the increasing number of people who are using our recreational 

facilities, the development of parks and recreational areas must be accelerated. 

 

In the past tourist season, the number of people who visited our provincial parks 

increased by  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 16 per cent 

 

The government, therefore, proposes to spend a total of ----------------------------------------- $2,400,000 

on provincial parks in the coming year. 

 

This is an increase of more than  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- $400,000 

over the current year’s provision and  ----------------------------------------------------------------- $800,000 

over the 1964-65 estimate. 

 

REGIONAL PARKS 
 

Special mention should be made of our regional parks program. The government makes a grant to 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

503 

municipalities which form a regional park equal to 60 per cent of the initial capital costs of the park. 

 

Up to the present time, 55 regional parks have been established, including 16 new parks established 

during 1965. 

 

The government has before it 11 new applications for assistance. 

 

The budget will provide  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $223,000 

in the form of construction and development grants to regional parks. 

 

This is an increase of 13 per cent over the current year’s provision. 

 

CAMPSITES 
 

In addition, the government will spend  --------------------------------------------------------------- $430,000 

on campsites and other recreational facilities, such as picnic and historic sites in 1966-67. 

 

The heavy utilization of these facilities, we feel, justified this level of spending. 

 

PUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONS 
 

In past decades, as a result of the depression, hundreds of public servants retired with pensions which 

were inadequate. 

 

With the steadily increasing cost of living, the plight of some of these individuals has become most 

difficult. 

 

Last session, legislation was introduced to increase those public service superannuation allowances: 

 

(1) which were granted prior to April 5, 1951; 
(2) which were less than $1,200 a year for widows and $2,400 a year for other pensioners. 

 

This year, we propose to introduce similar action to increase all pensions granted up to April 1, 1954. 

 

The average annual increase for widows will be about 
————————————————————————

$109 

and for other pensioners 
——————————————————————————————————————————

$218 

 

The first year, the cost of these increases is estimated at approximately 
————————————

-$23,000 

 

CANADA PENSION PLAN 
 

The government has also taken steps to integrate the Canada Pension Plan with the Public Service 

Superannuation Plan. 

 

This will be accomplished by diverting  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1.8 per cent 

of the public servants’ salary between $600 and $5,000 per annum, along with a matching contribution 

by the government to the Canada Pension Plan. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

504 

The proposed integrated pension scheme will not increase the cost to the public servant since the rate of 

contribution for the Public Service Superannuation Plan will be reduced by a corresponding 1.8 per cent. 

 

At the same time, the benefits of the superannuation plan will be reduced from 2 per cent for each year 

of service after January 1, 1966, to 1.3 per cent per year of service. 

 

It is estimated that integration will require a payment by the government of almost  -------- $1,200,000 

to the Canada Pension Plan in 1966-67. This represents both the employees’ 

and the government’s contribution to the Plan. 

 

PROVINCIAL-MUNICIPAL FINANCES 
 

In this budget, I feel I must refer to the subject of municipal finance. 

 

As hon. members know, last December, the government convened a provincial-municipal conference. 

 

We did so because of our concern for the financial problems faced by local governments. 

 

In recent year, local taxation has risen at an alarming rate. 

 

In order to finance the increased costs of municipal government, the local authorities have been obliged 

to rely primarily on the property tax. 

 

The result has been that the property tax burden in Saskatchewan has risen out of all reasonable 

proportion, and is one of the highest in Canada. 

 

The provincial government indicated to the conference a desire to help local governments, within our 

financial capacity. 

 

We reminded delegates that initially, we must always keep in mind our own duties and responsibilities. 

 

In the years ahead, our administration is faced with staggering new expenditures in many fields. 

 

We also indicated to the conference, that in our opinion: 

 

— the main responsibility for finding municipal revenues; 

 

— the main responsibility for curbing costs and spending; 

 

must continue to remain with local governments. 

 

We suggested nevertheless, that in a modest way, we were prepared in 1966, to increase financial 

assistance to municipalities. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

505 

We asked representatives from the three associations for their priorities. 

 

In this budget, we are prepared to translate into tangible action, some of the views expressed at the 

conference. 

 

I emphasize again, however, to those concerned, that all governments are faced with the problem of 

meeting unlimited demands, with limited resources. 

 

(1) EDUCATION 
 

As I have already indicated, the provincial government will pay an extra  -------------------- $5,000,000 

in ordinary grants for education, over and above the figure last year, to the various school units. 

 

We are also proposing to pay an additional  -------------------------------------------------------- $3,000,000 

in the form of incentive grants, together with  ----------------------------------------------------- $1,000,000 

towards the school boards’ contribution into the Canada Pension Plan. 

 

We estimate that this  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $9,000,000 

assistance should permit the average municipality to reduce taxes. 

 

(2) EQUALIZATION GRANTS 
 

The SARM made strong representations for an increase in equalization grants. 

 

Last year, the estimates contained  --------------------------------------------------------------------- $600,000 

for this purpose. 

 

In the coming year, we are prepared to increase this grant by  ---------------------------------- $1,400,000 

to a total of  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $2,000,000 

 

(3) GRID ROAD CONSTRUCTION 
 

At the conference, many rural delegates asked for additional help in constructing grid roads. 

 

We are prepared to increase these grants from  ---------------------------------------------------- $4,200,000 

to    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $5,000,000 

in 1966. 

 

This will provide for an increase of almost  ---------------------------------------------------------- $800,000 

 

(4) GRID ROAD MAINTENANCE 
 

Many representatives from rural areas also expressed concern about grid road maintenance. 

 

Up to the present time, no provincial assistance has been available for this purpose. 

 

Commencing April 1st, we will be prepared to pay for grid road maintenance on a fifty-fifty basis, up to 

a ceiling of  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $1,000,000 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

506 

(5) COLLECTOR STREETS — URBAN AREAS 
 

The urban municipalities urgently pressed for assistance in paving collector streets to main highways. 

 

We have reviewed this question and are prepared to make a beginning in the coming year with such 

assistance. 

 

A final formula has not been worked out, but in a general way — the government will spend 

up to -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $500,000 

for this purpose. 

 

In short, our government is prepared to increase direct grants to the municipalities for road construction 

and maintenance by  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $3,700,000 

 

This will be, of course, over and above the present level of ordinary programs. 

 

Hon. members will realize that the government will spend in 1966-67  --------------------- $16,400,000 

more on highways than we will receive from the gasoline and motor vehicle tax. 

 

Under the circumstances, we will be obliged to find elsewhere, some portion of this revenue required. 

 

Year after year, the rural municipalities have asked that one cent of the gasoline tax be earmarked for 

municipal road construction. 

 

We have carefully considered the suggestion. As a result, the government has decided to raise the 

gasoline tax by one cent per gallon, effective March 15th. 

 

The proceeds which are expected to reach  --------------------------------------------------------- $2,200,000 

will be spent entirely in financing grid road construction and maintenance. 

 

(6) SNOW REMOVAL ASSISTANCE 
 

Over the year, many municipalities have repeatedly requested provincial assistance for snow removal. 

 

Blocked roads become a major problem in years of heavy snowfall. 

 

As was indicated in the Throne Speech, our government is prepared to make grants for this purpose, up 

to a ceiling of  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $250,000 

 

Should this figure prove insufficient, we are prepared to review the matter one year hence. 

 

(7) SASKATCHEWAN ASSISTANCE PLAN 
 

The Saskatchewan Assistance Plan, which was unanimously accepted by all groups at the 

provincial-municipal conference, will result in an integration 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

507 

of all public assistance programs into one program based on need. 

 

This program will ensure better administration and assistance in the use of public funds for the medical 

and welfare needs of indigents. 

 

We estimate the municipalities will receive direct financial savings of  ------------------------- $400,000 

under the proposed plan. 

 

This budget provides total direct provincial financial assistance 

to local governments of  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- $77,800,000 

which is an increase of  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ $15,700,000 

above the current year’s appropriation. 

 

It is our hope that as industrial development continues and provincial revenues increase, we can 

gradually pass on additional assistance to the urban and rural municipalities. 

 

FISCAL FORECAST 
 

I should now like to discuss the government’s fiscal forecast. 

 

In making the forecast, as is the custom, we have assumed an average and normal crop of 18 bushels per 

acre. 

 

Using this basis and anticipating continued economic buoyancy at both the national and provincial level, 

we expect our revenues to rise quite sharply in the coming year. 

 

The major consumption taxes should all yield higher returns in 1966-67: 

 

— the sales tax should yield  --------------------------------------------------------------------- $46,100,000 

— the gasoline tax will likely reach  ------------------------------------------------------------ $31,500,000 

— the liquor profits are expected to rise to  ---------------------------------------------------- $19,100,000 

— tobacco tax should yield  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ $3,700,000 

 

In total, we expect the consumption taxes to increase by  -------------------------------------- $11,800,000 

above the estimate budgeted in 1965-66. 

 

Receipts under the federal-provincial tax sharing arrangements will be  -------------------- $19,200,000 

higher than this year’s original estimate. 

 

Of this increase, about  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $6,200,000 

is due to the additional 3 per cent abatement to the provinces on individual income tax and the effect of 

this on equalization payments. 

 

The oil and gas programs which we introduced at the last session are already paying dividends, for both 

the Saskatchewan economy and the Provincial Treasury. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

508 

In the coming year, these programs, plus the potash development, should result in total mineral 

resources revenues of  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- $37,500,000 

exceeding the 1965-66 original estimate by  ------------------------------------------------------- $7,700,000 

 

In total then, we are forecasting that revenues would amount to  ---------------------------- $267,600,000 

 

With the one cent increase in the gasoline tax which is being imposed 

to help local governments, revenues would reach  --------------------------------------------- $269,800,000 

 

This would represent an increase of --------------------------------------------------------------- $48,800,000 

above the 1965-66 original estimates. 

 

On the other hand, as I have already stated, expenditures on the programs which this government intends 

to accelerate, will also be up sharply. 

 

We expect that ordinary expenditures during 1966-67 will total  ---------------------------- $260,500,000 

 

This would result in a surplus to the government of  ---------------------------------------------- $9,300,000 

We propose to use this surplus for tax reduction and relief. 

 

ADDITIONAL SALES TAX EXEMPTIONS 
 

In keeping with the government’s promise to extend the list of agricultural items which should be 

exempt from the sales tax, this budget proposes to exempt on April 1st, an additional 13 farm items, they 

are as follows: 

 

   Egg-room coolers and controls; 

   Water line medicators; 

   Poultry nests; 

   Egg Coolers; 

   Turkey saddles; 

   Incubators and accessories; 

   Farrowing crates; 

   Cow trainers; 

   Livestock tags; 

   Halters and tying chains for livestock and harness for horses; 

   Milk and cream cans; 

   Teat dilators; 

   Snow plough attachments to farm tractors and 

   farm trucks. 

 

SALES TAX INCLUSIONS 
 

On the other hand, there is one class of goods which was originally exempted from the sales tax, which 

we propose to make subject to the 4 per cent levy. 

 

Effective April 1st, soaps, detergents and other cleansing agents, will be included in the 4 per cent 

category. 

 

Specifically included will be the following: 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

509 

   Ammonia 

   Bleaches 

   Blueing 

   Chloride of Lime 

   Cleansing Powders 

   Laundry Starch 

   Lye 

   Toilet & Laundry Soaps, including 

   flakes and powders 

 

The effect of these first two changes will be minor, though the net effect should be to improve the 

budgetary revenues by at least  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- $100,000 

 

PROVINCIAL INCOME TAX SURCHARGE 
 

We have long maintained that the income tax surcharge of 6 per cent, which was levied by the 

Socialists, is out of line. 

 

We see no reason why citizens of Saskatchewan should pay more income tax than other Canadians. 

 

Moreover, we feel that this is one tax where Saskatchewan can ill afford to be out of line, since it could 

have serious consequences for the economic growth of the province. 

 

We would hope to eliminate this surcharge in the forthcoming years. 

 

However, due to the increased demand for government services and rising expenditures, we cannot see 

our way clear to do this immediately. 

 

In this budget, we wish to make a beginning. Commencing January 1, 1966, Saskatchewan income tax 

surcharge will be reduced from 6 per cent to 5 per cent. 

 

This reduction will bring our levy in line with that of our sister province of Manitoba. 

 

This reduction will provide Saskatchewan’s income tax payers with an additional  --------- $1,100,000 

of disposable income. 

 

HOME-OWNERS GRANTS 
 

The Liberal party has long expressed concern over the level of property and land taxes in Saskatchewan. 

 

In this budget we propose to do something about the problem. 

 

In the current year, we shall commence paying a direct grant to homeowners, both rural and urban 

which in most cases will amount to  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- $
  
50 

 

This grant will be paid directly to Saskatchewan residents who live in their own homes, for six months 

or more and who have paid their current property taxes. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

510 

The amount of the grant to be paid to eligible property owners will be the lesser of $50 or one-half of the 

current year’s taxes. 

 

It is estimated this program will cost in the first year  ------------------------------------------- $ 8,000,000 

and will have the same effect as about a  ------------------------------------------------------------ 7 per cent 

reduction in the total property tax. 

 

Each home owner will become eligible for the grant when he has paid his current local taxes. 

 

We will arrange to make application forms available at all municipal and provincial government offices. 

 

LLOYDMINSTER 
 

Last fall, I announced that the government would be obliged to seek a solution to end the situation 

whereby the people of Lloydminster were receiving full provincial benefits, but not paying a fair share 

of Saskatchewan taxes. 

 

Today, for the most part, these citizens pay little or no sales tax, no tobacco tax, and not the full gasoline 

tax. 

 

We have met with Lloydminster City Council and representatives of the Chamber of Commerce several 

times and invited these bodies to come forward with alternative proposals. 

 

No acceptable solution has been reached. 

 

We, therefore, intend to exclude property owners in the City of Lloydminster and rural areas in the 

immediate vicinity from receiving the Home-Owner Grant. 

 

This will help partially offset the loss of the sales, tobacco and gasoline tax from the residents in that 

community. 

 

I would point out that these taxpayers, on an overall basis, will still be making a much smaller 

contribution to the Treasury, than citizens in other parts of Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — 

 

In short, this budget 

 

(1)
 
Provides for increased spending on essential services, in the sum of  ----------------- $ 24,100,000 

(2)
 
Brings additional direct provincial assistance to our local governments of ---------- $ 15,700,000 

(3)
 
Provides for net tax reductions of  ------------------------------------------------------------ $

 
6,800,000 

(4)
 
Forecasts a surplus in the coming year of ----------------------------------------------------- $

  
300,000 

 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

511 

When these accomplishments are compared with the financial records of other governments in Canada, I 

feel we can take some satisfaction. 

 

I think, for example, of the huge $200,000,000 tax increases announced some two weeks ago by the 

government of wealthy Ontario. 

 

CONCLUSION 
 

Against the background of a second straight year of provincial prosperity, it would be difficult to be less 

than optimistic. 

 

I believe that prosperity will continue, because it stands on an ever-broadening base of diversity — an 

achievements in agriculture, resource development, trade, and secondary industries. 

 

But, if our present situation and prospects are pleasing, there can be no room for complacency. 

 

I must offer a cautionary word. 

 

A boom in economic activity has been too often followed by a lower cycle of retrenchment and 

frustration. 

 

We must constantly watch for danger signs. 

 

One of these signs, of course is the ever-present danger of unemployment. 

 

This chronic difficulty can be eliminated only by increasing the number of jobs available to our people. 

 

In a highly mobile and dynamic economy such as is evolving today in Saskatchewan, established skills 

and trades disappear and change constantly. 

 

The battle to maintain a trained, versatile work force, with no unemployment, can be won only through 

constant attention to training and retaining of workers, — even though a substantial investment may be 

involved. 

 

Any other approach is a luxury no expanding economy can afford. 

 

I say again, Mr. Speaker, that I expect a high level of economic activity to continue in Saskatchewan. 

 

But, I am also convinced that vigorous expansion will only take place if we continue to encourage and 

seek out private enterprise. 

 

Saskatchewan is one of the last great undeveloped frontiers in the world. 

 

I expect over the next decade, it will become one of the continent’s boom areas. 

 

The challenge to the government and our people is to most effectively utilize our resources to provide a 

better living for all our citizens. 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

512 

Mr. Speaker, I move that you do now leave the Chair. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. A. E. Blakeney (Regina West): — Mr. Speaker, my first words must be to compliment the 

Provincial Treasurer on delivering a well-prepared address in a competent manner. The address itself 

and its contents reflect the competence of the staff whom the Provincial Treasurer had to call upon and 

his own competence in the field of finances. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Blakeney: — I compliment him on a speech well delivered. I hope the next words won’t sound 

carping but I want to express a little regret that the custom of long standing about giving the opposition 

financial critic a copy of the Budget Speech in advance could not have been followed. It had been the 

custom in previous years for the Provincial Treasurer to hand to the financial critic a copy of the speech 

before the Provincial Treasurer entered the chamber. That wasn’t done last year. I made some mild 

remark about it last year thinking it was due to the inexperience of the new Provincial Treasurer. I was 

sorry that this year evidently it was not possible to provide a copy of the speech until just over half an 

hour ago. 

 

I did want, Mr. Speaker, to make a few remarks. I will of course make the bulk of my remarks on 

Monday, but there are a few things that I would like to say now. I think the speech is characterized 

primarily by what it does not say rather than what it says. I will deal with one or two aspects of it in that 

light. 

 

Let’s think first of the borrowing program which the Provincial Treasurer indicated he would be 

following and indeed that he followed last year. He told us that he raised his money last year almost 

exclusively by Saskatchewan Savings bonds and by borrowing in the United States. Now, Mr. Speaker, 

the Provincial Treasurer, when he was in opposition, very frequently called upon the previous 

government to exercise standards of financial prudence. He used to say that it was unwise to borrow 

extensive sums by Savings Bonds and that it was unwise to borrow extensive sums in the United States. 

He used to say this because when one raises money with Savings Bonds, one incurs a redemption risk. 

Savings Bonds are bonds which can be cashed at any time. And when one borrows in the United States 

one incurs an exchange risk; the risk that the rate of exchange between the Canadian dollar and the 

American dollar may change in a manner which would be adverse to the Canadian dollar. It is therefore 

surprising to see that the Provincial Treasurer relied upon these two relatively more risky ways of 

borrowing to gather up all his money and relied upon the Canadian bond market for virtually none of his 

money. 

 

He prides himself on the fact that the Saskatchewan Savings Bonds have yielded more money last year 

and that presumably they will yield more money this year. There was never any doubt that more money 

could have been raised by the vehicle of Saskatchewan Savings Bonds. It was the policy of the previous 

government to limit the amount borrowed in any year on Saskatchewan Savings Bonds to a sum of 

$10,000,000 or some amount slightly more than that; the object being to prevent the possibility of a run 

on these parity bonds, a run of the nature that was experienced by the government of British Columbia a 

couple or three years ago

when they found themselves in a difficult circumstances because of the large amount of parity bonds 

they had outstanding. In effect the government of British Columbia had to guarantee a higher rate of 

interest to all of the holders of these bonds. The whole purpose of marketing Saskatchewan Savings 

Bonds was to get them into the hands of borrowers who would not use them as a vehicle for trading on 

the money market. And this was done by limiting the amount to $10,000 and by saying that the bonds 

could not be purchased by any corporation unless it had its head office in Saskatchewan. 

 

Now, the Premier, forced to raise more money by this device, last year raised the limit from $10,000 to 

$15,000. This year he has raised the limit from $15,000 to $20,000 and he has removed the provision 

which says that a corporation which purchases these must have its head office in Saskatchewan. He 

further, I darkly suspect, has instructed a good number of the funds under his control to invest in 

Saskatchewan Savings Bonds. This of course, will increase the figures but will not in effect increase the 

sums of money available to the government in any way since these sums were at all times available to 

the government. I may be wrong on that. If so, doubtless I will be corrected at some later stage in the 

debate. 

 

I was interested in the remark by the Provincial Treasurer in his last Budget Speech saying that the 

government believes that as a matter of policy we should borrow in the Canadian market. He then 

proceeded to borrow $33,000,000, not one penny in the Canadian bond market. 

 

A number of other things the speech did not say. I was certainly entertained by the remarks of the 

Provincial Treasurer with respect to the Saskatchewan Power Corporation. You will recall that he said 

that a large amount of the capital of this corporation was financed by borrowings. That many of these 

SPC bonds were owed to the United States holders; that this was at variance with CCF pronouncements; 

and that in fact very seldom do the CCF practice what they preach. Well, I excuse him because perhaps 

he hasn’t had a great deal of experience in listening to preachers but all I want to say is this, that this is 

not what the CCF preaches. We have long said that there is nothing wrong with borrowing in the United 

States, with obtaining foreign capital, so long as it is obtained on a loan basis. If we must finance our 

development of Canada and of Saskatchewan by capital brought in from outside, and I am sure we must, 

then by all means let’s finance it on a basis whereby it can, at some future date, be paid back and the 

equity in the capital development be owned by the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Blakeney: — This is indeed what can be done with the Saskatchewan Power corp. The Premier’s 

figure of 7 1/2 per cent which be bandies about, excludes the investment in the corporation by farmers 

by way of contributions to construction cost. If this sum were included the amount of capital contributed 

by Saskatchewan people would be of the order of perhaps 15 or 16 per cent. However, the general point 

he makes, that a substantial portion of the capital cost of building the Power Corporation was supplied 

by borrowers, is accurate. And certainly I make no apology for that. I think that if we in Saskatchewan 

had not gone out and borrowed large sums of money to build this great corporation, if we had followed 

the financial practices so often urged upon

The members who sit opposite us and on your right, Mr. Speaker, then there would be no Power 

Corporation . . . 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 


Mr. Blakeney: — All of these are possible and were possible only because substantial sums of money 

were borrowed. I have no doubt that in due course these sums will be paid off. It may well be that other 

sums will be borrowed, but as they are borrowed new assets will be created and the people of 

Saskatchewan will have the equity position in a greater and greater corporation. 

 

The Premier indicated very seldom do the CCF practice what they preach. Well, I reminded myself of 

some of the preachings of the Provincial Treasurer last year. I thought particularly of the psychiatric 

centre at Prince Albert. I remember the Provincial Treasurer and more particularly the Minister of Public 

Health (Mt. Steuart) making an announcement about that psychiatric health services in Saskatchewan. I 

remember that the announcement was in the budget; the estimates provided for a sum of $250,000. I find 

that of that sum of $250,000 budgeted for last year, not one cent has been spent. I find that in the new 

budget for the forthcoming year not one cent is provided. And I can only assume that this . . . 

 

Hon. D. Steuart (Minister of Health): — Look in your salt mine you might find it. 

 

Mr. Blakeney: — Well maybe . . . 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Steuart: — They are digging the hole and building it as fast as they can . . . 

 

Mr. Blakeney: — Yes, well, it may well be there but if it is I anticipate that it will indicate no more 

action on the part of the government than the budget of $250,000 last year indicated on the part of the 

government. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear!

 

Mr. Blakeney: — It is very easy indeed to put sums in the estimates as we found last year. An estimate 

of $100,000 was provided for the base ho at Regina, not one penny of which was spent. 

 

I really must compliment the Premier on the facility with which he used the figures which were 

contained in his budget. Members will have noted the large increase in grants to the university. He said 

this represented a major increase over the 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

515 

grants previously given. He neglected to say that in the interim the teachers’ colleges had been 

incorporated into the university. He neglected in calculating the sums previously contributed by the old 

government to add in sums which were used to finance the teachers’ colleges. By this rather simple 

device he makes his figures look good. 

 

I note how he makes his school grant figures look good by adding some $6,000,000 which is for 

technical education into the school grant figure. When this is eliminated the actual increase in grants will 

be very small indeed. 

 

I remember how this was done last year, how the sums for the technical schools which had been 

budgeted separately by the previous government were included in the school grant figure so that he 

could bolster up what was last year a most pitiful figure. I note that this year there is once again, never 

daunted, an amount in the budget for an extension to the technical institute at Saskatoon. It was in last 

year. The figure which was used last year for the technical institute at Saskatoon was $405,000. The 

minister was good enough to tell me in a reply to my question a week or so ago that of this $405,000 the 

amount which had been spent in expanding the technical institute in the last year was the sum of $10. 

Now applying the same ratio I would reckon that this year they are going to get about $50 or $60 spent 

on the technical institute at Saskatoon. 

 

I think that the story on technical education in which I will have a good deal more to say on Monday 

cannot be more dramatically illustrated than by asking any member opposite and any member on this 

side to go down in this city to the corner of College Avenue and Winnipeg Street and to see there the 

Miller Composite School under construction. There he will see before his eyes a full two-thirds of the 

effort of the government opposite on technical education throughout the whole province. Of the money 

spent on technical education, which money in the last two years has provided not one single place for 

one single student, two-thirds of the money is represented by that building under construction at the 

corner of College Avenue and Winnipeg Street, a building which is, as people in Regina will know, 

another composite school, but which members opposite persist in referring to as an institution for 

technical education. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I want only to touch on one other topic before I take my seat and this is the Saskatchewan 

Government Insurance Office. I was pleased to hear the Premier’s remarks that the insurance office is to 

be continued. I was pleased to hear that it had had a profitable year, indeed perhaps the most profitable 

year in its history. I was pleased to hear that with the millstone, as he calls it, of the Saskatchewan 

Guarantee and Fidelity Company, Limited no longer about its neck, it has a future of almost unlimited 

horizons, a future which will be profitable almost beyond our wildest dreams. I only regretted that at the 

end of this rosy picture the Premier had not explained to the House why he found it necessary to 

increase rates generally across the board on policies written by the Saskatchewan Government Insurance 

Office. 

 

An Hon. Member:  To make them more competitive of course. 

 

Mr. Blakeney: — There can, I fancy, be no possible explanation for that action based upon business 

reasons. I think we can seek our 



 

February 25, 1966 

 

 

516 

reasons elsewhere, reasons which probably would be found in the same general area as could be found 

in explaining the new financing policy for Saskatchewan Government Telephones. He said that the 

government is going to permit Saskatchewan Government Telephones to retain some $2,000,000 of its 

earnings. I wish he had advised the House that the consequences of that policy, unless there are some 

new agreements signed and they are obviously not signed at this time — the consequences of this policy 

are to make a rather handsome gift to the Bell Telephone Company and to the B.C. Telephone 

Company. 

 

The Premier shakes his head. If he has any agreements signed which will provide otherwise, I invite him 

to lay them before this House. Because on the agreements which now exist between Saskatchewan 

Government Telephones and the other carriers across Canada, this new policy will have only one effect 

and that is to bonus the Bell Telephone Company and B.C. Telephone Company. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Blakeney: — Well, I doubt whether the B.C. Telephone or Bell Telephone is likely to class as 

Socialist. It may well be as I earlier indicated that the reason for that and the reason for the increase in 

rates in the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office are not wholly unrelated. 

 

Mr. Speaker, there are a number of other topics on which I want to comment. I believe that the House 

will thank Member if I do not make my comments now but make them next Monday when I trust they 

will be somewhat better organized. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I beg leave to adjourn the debate. 

 

Some Hon. Members:  Hear, hear! 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

On the motion of the Hon. Mr. Steuart the Assembly adjourned at 4:32 o’clock p.m.
