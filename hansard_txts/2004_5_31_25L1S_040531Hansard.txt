Dufresne, Steve Skoworodko, and Lyle Moffatt.

Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

government caucus, I, too, would like to welcome all of the

accompanied by their teachers, Colleen Nelson and Val 
McNinch, as well as chaperones, Debbie Gray, Val Spencer, 
Lane Therres, Clint Marsh, Brenda Johnson, Linda Knowlton, 
and Stuart Macnab. Mr. Speaker, it seems like an inordinate 
number of chaperones required for 23 students. 
 
We welcome our Turtleford visitors to their legislature. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(13:45) 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and

Hon. Mr. Cline: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to 
introduce to you and through you to other members of the 
Assembly, some very important guests seated in your gallery, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this week is Mining Week in Saskatchewan. And 
as we all know, the mining industry is very important for our 
province. Mining is the third largest sector of our economy, and 
employs over 20,000 people directly and indirectly. 
 
Joining us today to mark the launch of Mining Week in 
Saskatchewan are representatives of the Saskatchewan Mining 
Association. I would ask each of them to stand as I read their 
names. We have Norm Beug, the past president of the 
Saskatchewan Mining Association; Mr. Bruce Lambert, the 
second vice-president; Moe Davyduke, member at large; and 
Ghislaine McLeod, of the Public Awareness Committee; and 
also Mr. Phil Reeves, the executive director. 
 

Mr. Speaker, I would ask all members to join with me in 
welcoming these representatives of Saskatchewan’s mining 
industry in honour of Mining Week, and invite all members and 
anyone watching at home to take part in the many interesting 
Mining Week events taking place all over Saskatchewan and to 
remember, mining is good for Saskatchewan. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Lloydminster. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And on behalf of 
the official opposition, I would like to, as well, join the minister 
in welcoming this group to the legislature. This is in fact a very 
important sector of our economy. And we look forward to 
meeting with this group shortly, and welcome to your 
legislature. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, seated in your gallery is a very small group of grade 
12 students from Balfour Collegiate in Regina. They’re here 
today accompanied by their teacher Karen Jackson. And 
although they’re a very small group, they’re a significant group 
because they’re here every year to see the proceedings, Mr. 
Speaker. And I would like to introduce them to you and through 
you to all of the members, and ask all the members to join with 
me in extending them, again, a warm welcome. Thank you very 
much. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, it’s my privilege to introduce a group of people in the 
east gallery, specifically 14 students from grades 7, 8, and 9 
from the North Star School in Hyas, Saskatchewan. And along 
with the students is their teacher, Vicki Goossen, and along 
with the students are a number of chaperones, so this is fairly 
large group. I want to introduce Grant and Trudy Penner, 
Rodney and Aldine Goossen, Charles and Donalda Goossen, 
and Shauna Reimer. 
 
And I’d ask all members to join with me in welcoming this 
group to Regina and to the Legislative Assembly.

Saskatchewan Mining Week 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
mining is Saskatchewan’s third largest industry behind gas and 
oil and agriculture. The use of advanced technology makes 
Saskatchewan one of the most competitive and productive 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1287 

mining sectors in the world. This makes Saskatchewan Mining 
Week, from May 31 to June 5, as much a celebration of new 
science as it is about old rocks. 
 
Innovative advances in Saskatchewan mining include the 
application of robotics to improve safety at the mining face, the 
development and utilization of solution mining techniques to 
recover potash, and the development of freeze technology to 
mine unstable ground. 
 
Every year Saskatchewan produces $2.4 billion worth of 
minerals including coal, gold, sodium sulphate, copper, zinc, 
and, Mr. Speaker, the potential of diamonds in the future. The 
mineral sector provides employment for 20,000 people in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
This year’s theme to mining week is Employee Health and 
Wellness, and the Saskatchewan Mining Association is hosting 
a number of activities including the highlighting of regional 
science fair winners at a launch event at the Royal 
Saskatchewan Museum today. Saskatchewan Mining Week will 
wrap up with a June 5 mine rescue competition as well as a 
banquet at the Prairieland Park in Saskatoon. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize those who work in the 
mining industry for their contribution to this province’s 
economy and for their continued dedication to creating a safer 
workplace. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Lloydminster. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On this 
Saskatchewan Mining Week and following an earlier 
introduction, I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of 
the official opposition to take note of the provincial mining 
week in Saskatchewan. 
 
It should be no secret to anyone that mining is one of the most 
important industries in our province’s economy, and certainly 
one of our greatest sources of employment. 
 
In 2003 the total value of mineral sales from Saskatchewan 
mining industry was again in excess of $2 billion — $2 billion. 
Likewise in 2003, the mining industry spent an additional $2 
billion on wages, goods, and services, which has enormous 
impact on our economy. As well, it paid into the provincial 
treasury hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties to help us 
better fund important services such as health and education. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we are already the world leader in potash and the 
world leader in uranium mining, and there are exciting new 
developments on the horizon. The mining industry is a 
testament to how important private sector investment is in our 
economy and why we should be doing as much as we can to 
encourage even greater investment in Saskatchewan. 
 
It is with great pleasure that I stand today and thank those who 
have invested in this industry, and it’s a tremendous positive for 
our province and each and every citizen of Saskatchewan.

Grand Opening of Meadow Lake Oriented 
Strand Board Plant 

 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. On 
Saturday myself, the Premier, and the Minister of Government 
Relations had the opportunity to attend and take part in the 
official opening of the Meadow Lake oriented strand board 
plant. 
 
The Meadow Lake OSB Limited Partnership is an 
extraordinarily successful alliance between Tolko Industries, 
Northwest Community Wood Products, the Meadow Lake 
Tribal Council and, of course, the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
The mill went into production in August of 2003 and has not 
looked back since. It is an incredible example of what can be 
accomplished when private industry, government, and 
Aboriginal communities work together, Mr. Speaker. And I’m 
proud to say it is the largest oriented strand board processing 
plant in the world. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the new mill employs 120 people directly and 
another 120 indirectly in various woodlands operations such as 
harvesting, trucking, and silviculture. 
 
Both John and Al Thorlakson of Tolko Industries were on hand 
for the grand opening, and they had nothing but positive things 
to say about the people and the Government of Saskatchewan, 
saying that they would not hesitate to reinvest more in our 
province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I think such kind words are an amazing testimonial to both the 
greatness of the people of Saskatchewan and the great things 
our government is doing. Please join me in congratulating all 
the partners of this highly successful venture. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker.

Eileen McRae Honoured at Air Cadet Review 
Ceremony in Davidson 

 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This past Saturday in 
Davidson I had the honour of attending the Saskatchewan Air 
Cadet review hosted by the local 553 Sherlock Squadron. 
 
Her Honour, Lieutenant Governor Lynda Haverstock, 
conducted the military review and bestowed honours on certain 
cadets for high conduct. The ceremony was well attended with 
over 200 people. 
 
Significant of those being honoured was Mrs. Eileen McRae 
who has worked closely with the cadet movement since 1985 as 
supply officer, administration officer for the Sherlock 
Squadron. Her countless volunteer hours were richly 
appreciated by the cadet leadership and the many youths she’d 
assisted and counselled over the past 20 years. I had the distinct 
honour of presenting Mrs. McRae with a Certificate of 



1288 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

Achievement on behalf of the Arm River-Watrous constituency 
and the Government of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mrs. McRae’s community service goes beyond the bounds of 
the air cadet league to include 4-H instructor for 10 years, since 
1973-83, as well as being actively involved in the Catholic 
Willing Workers organization from 1976 to present, as well as 
an active member of the Royal Canadian Legion in Davidson 
since 1989. 
 
I would ask all members to join me congratulating Mrs. Eileen 
McRae on her outstanding level of voluntary service to the air 
cadets, the community of Davidson. Thank you.

World No Tobacco Day 
 
Mr. Addley: — Mr. Speaker, today is World No Tobacco Day. 
This is a day to raise public awareness about the harmful effects 
of smoking and to develop ways we can work together as 
communities, cities, and governments to help foster a healthier 
society. 
 
Mr. Speaker, tobacco use is the most significant preventable 
cause of disease, disability, and premature death in Canada. 
Tobacco kills three times more Canadians each year than 
alcohol, AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), illegal 
drugs, car accidents, suicide, and murder — all combined. 
Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke also poses serious risk 
to health. 
 
Mr. Speaker, World No Tobacco Day has special meaning for 
us this year. It comes less than three weeks after our 
government introduced The Tobacco Control Amendment Act, 
2004, an Act that calls for Saskatchewan to be smoke-free by 
January 1, 2005. 
 
Today my colleague, the Minister of Health, is extending a 
special thank you to the five municipalities of Moose Jaw, 
Humboldt, Yorkton, Saskatoon, and Prince Albert for their 
contribution to tobacco reduction in Saskatchewan by providing 
leadership in developing smoke-free bylaws prior to the 
introduction of The Tobacco Control Amendment Act. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize the Canadian Cancer 
Society, the Saskatchewan Coalition for Tobacco Reduction, 
the Saskatchewan Lung Association and the Heart and Stroke 
Foundation for working tirelessly in defence of those who have 
been exposed to second-hand and first-hand smoke. Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker.

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Rural Sports Hall of Fame Induction Dinner at Indian Head 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to 

inform the Assembly of a busy weekend that has just passed in 
the beautiful, mind you wet, community of Indian Head. 
 
On Friday night, the member for Moosomin and I were able 
attend the 9th annual Rural Sports Hall of Fame Induction 
Dinner in Indian Head where eight individual or teams were 
inducted. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this dinner is really quite a unique dinner where 
you’ll see people going into the Rural Sports Hall of Fame that 
have gained international fame, national fame, right down to the 
person that’s helped out with a local softball team being 
inducted. And this year was no different. 
 
Mr. Speaker, a couple of people of note that were inducted into 
this year’s Sports Hall of Fame were George Beach, formerly 
from Indian Head, and became a national star in Great Britain 
through his hockey playing abilities, as well as the Eddie Shore 
family from the Cupar area that were inducted, right along to 
the Glenavon Pipers — the 1963, ’64, and ’65 Glenavon Pipers, 
who won the provincial title as well as many league 
championships. 
 
Congratulations to the inductees, but even more importantly 
congratulations to Ken McCabe and his induction dinner 
committee that put on this fine evening. 
 
As well as attending that on Saturday, I had the opportunity of 
attending four businesses that held grand openings — the Indian 
Head vet clinic, friendly dog photography, the Indian Head 
plumbing and heating company, as well as Webster meats. 
 
And one plug, Mr. Speaker, for Webster meats. They have a 
great bison T-bone. If anybody’s passing through Indian Head, 
stop by Webster meats; they have a great T-bone. 
Congratulations.

Rainbow Youth Centre 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Mr. Speaker, last Friday my colleague 
from Regina Dewdney and I had the opportunity to attend the 
Rainbow Youth Centre’s comedy dinner and silent auction. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the evening was a great success with about 400 
people attending to support the good work being done by the 
Rainbow Youth Centre. We heard from some of the youth who 
spoke positively about how the centre has been a safe place 
where they find support and the encouragement they need to 
succeed in their lives. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the centre has been operating since 1982, working 
with young people between the ages of 11 and 25, offering 
them a variety of services from individual and group 
counselling to skills development and educational, recreational, 
and direct service programs, all designed to meet the needs of 
our youth as they grow, develop, and change. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Rainbow Youth Centre is all about creating 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1289 

strong and healthy communities by supporting the development 
of strong and healthy individuals. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking all the participants and sponsors of last Friday’s 
event and in acknowledging everyone involved with the 
Rainbow Youth Centre for their commitment to community and 
to young people. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 

Changes to The Ambulance Act 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister of Health. The government recently introduced Bill 59, 
a Bill that drastically changes The Ambulance Act. Mr. 
Speaker, by changing the terms of contracts, operators will no 
longer be able to provide their bankers with the long-term 
forecasting necessary to secure financing for capital 
expenditures for equipment and ambulance fleets. 
 
My question, Mr. Speaker, is: why is the NDP government 
jeopardizing the ability of ambulance operators to do business 
in this province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(14:00) 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, what we’re doing in this 
legislation, which will come forward into this forum for debate, 
is to have the ambulance operators and how they operate use the 
same accountability rules of all health care organizations 
throughout the province, including various affiliated 
organizations. 
 
And so this is not something that is different. It’s something 
that other groups are able to use, and we plan to make sure that 
it provides the ability for ambulance operators to continue to 
provide services across the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the minister’s rhetoric 
sounds all well and good, but the reality, the simple reality is 
that Bill 59 will severely compromise ambulance operators’ 
ability to do business. Dismantling The Ambulance Act little by 
little is not the answer. 
 
These changes will diminish the value of long-term businesses 
who have faithfully provided a necessary service to our 
communities and continue to do so. Without secure contracts, 
they can expect a dramatic loss on their investment should they 
ever try to sell their businesses. Understandably this NDP 
government wouldn’t understand such a thing. 
 
Why is this government trying to destroy the public-private 

partnership that the emergency medical services have provided 
in Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, what will happen for the 
ambulance operators is that they will be designated as health 
care organizations and therefore will be able to provide services 
and receive government funding under The Regional Health 
Services Act, and that will be the same as many other groups in 
the province that are designated that way, who provide services. 
They get funding they need for their operations, and they 
continue to provide good service throughout the province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this will happen as contracts are renewed, and 
many of the contracts have quite a number of years in it. The 
plan is to have an orderly transition to the new system. And we 
intend to do it in a way that provides good emergency medical 
services for the people across the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, this legislation will destabilize 
and demoralize the entire industry and jeopardize patient care, 
especially at a time when rural people have valid concerns 
about their ability to access emergency services. 
 
The Saskatchewan Emergency Medical Services Association 
has communicated their concerns and is prepared to work with 
the government to improve the accountability mechanisms 
within the current legislation. Last year this government 
dropped important legislation that would allow paramedics to 
self-regulate because of concerns raised by one localized group. 
Now this government wants to ignore the major stakeholders 
that this legislation will affect. Mr. Speaker, why is this 
government refusing to listen to the concerns expressed by the 
Saskatchewan Emergency Medical Services Association? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I’ve had discussions with 
representatives of the Emergency Medical Services Association, 
and approximately half of their members are private contractors 
which relate to the questions that the member opposite raises. 
The other half are services that are provided by the regional 
health authorities themselves. And they end up having some 
different issues within their own organization. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what we are doing is we want to make sure that 
the whole system is accountable, that it works together, and that 
it works in a way that provides full details to all people in the 
province who provide the money for the services. We’re going 
to do that, and we’re going to do it in an organized fashion. And 
we’re going to work together with this organization and all their 
members. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 



1290 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, the minister should know that 
SEMSA represents both public and contracted EMS 
(emergency medical services) providers, and they have, on 
behalf of their members, expressed their concern to this 
government both personally and in writing. And this minister 
has chosen to ignore those representations. 
 
Mr. Speaker, these proposed amendments will have an adverse 
effect on the EMS operations and impede the ability to have a 
sustainable EMS system for Saskatchewan citizens. These 
people have invested in our communities to provide a necessary 
and important service to Saskatchewan people. 
 
Mr. Speaker, despite the minister’s saying that he has met with 
these people and listened to them, will he meet in a meaningful 
way with the SEMSA representatives to work out a positive 
way of serving the people of Saskatchewan in the EMS system? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, one of the things that we are 
also doing with this legislation is responding to a resolution put 
forward by the Saskatchewan Association of Rural 
Municipalities in the year 2000. And one of my predecessor 
ministers of Health said that in the process of reviewing 
ambulance services across the province, that this is one of the 
issues that we would be looking at, which is around how the 
accountability of the whole system works. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we’ve responded to that in a number of different 
ways. We’ve worked with the people who are providing these 
services across the province. Our goal is to continue to provide 
good services across the province in an accountable way, and 
we are going to do that. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 
 

Closure of Long-Term Care Beds 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. People in the 
Davidson area are very concerned about the NDP’s (New 
Democratic Party) plan to shut down 10 long-term care beds at 
Davidson Health Centre. They’re also very appalled that these 
closures and job losses were made without first consulting with 
the very people whose lives are going to be affected by these 
decisions. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the mayor of Davidson has written to the Chair of 
Human Services Committee. He says, and I quote: 
 

I am most concerned that the Davidson Town Council nor 
the community at large was consulted in any way prior to 
this major decision on our local health services. 

 
Mr. Speaker, the Saskatchewan Party has presented a motion 
calling for the Human Services Committee to hold public 
meetings in the affected areas. The mayor of Davidson has 
written to the committee to support this proposal. Would the 

Premier support our motion and allow public hearings to take 
place before these closures and job losses take effect? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Well, Mr. Speaker, this is a similar 
question that was asked by some other members from some 
other parts of the province last week. And what we are going to 
do, Mr. Speaker, is work with the regional health authorities 
and work with the processes they have in place around going 
ahead with some of the decisions that we’ve made in our budget 
decisions around health care. And what we’re going to continue 
to do, Mr. Speaker, is identify those kinds of places where 
changes need to be made because there will be changes. 
 
In this particular case we have a wing of the Davidson facility 
which is quite old and which is not up to the standards we use 
today. That part will be closed; they will use other parts. But it 
will be done in a way that reflects the residents who are there 
and will be provided within that Heartland Health Region in an 
appropriate way. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. The mayor of 
Girvin has written a similar letter to the committee Chair calling 
for public hearings. He says, and I quote: 
 

I believe that input from my office and area residents 
should have been gathered before . . . (the) decision (to) 
impact our community. 

 
Mr. Speaker, the people in these communities are just asking 
for a chance to be heard, for a chance to tell their side of the 
story, to find out exactly what the government is going out 
there. With public meetings, maybe . . . there is a strong fear out 
there that there’s going to be more bed closures and people are 
going to be moved out of them, particular of that hospital, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Before the NDP shuts down these beds, will he at least come 
out and consult and talk to the people out there? If the Premier 
is so confident in his plan for health care, why is he refusing to 
allow public hearings in communities like Davidson? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, there are many challenges in 
health care in our province and right across the country. And we 
will continue to work at those problems on a local basis and on 
a national basis as the Minister of Finance and I were doing 
yesterday in Toronto. And what we will continue to do, Mr. 
Speaker, is understand what kinds of services are required in 
various communities. But there will be changes that will be 
made because it’s necessary to do that. 
 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1291 

And what we promise, Mr. Speaker, is to make the most 
effective use of the dollars that we provide for health care 
services right across this province, and we’re going to continue 
to do that Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Well if you’re willing to make these changes, 
you should be willing to come out to these communities to tell 
these people what’s happening with these changes out there. 
You owe that . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order. I would ask the member to make all 
his remarks through the Chair. 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The minister and this 
government owes it to those people out there to tell them about 
the changes because right now they don’t know what’s 
happening out there. There is rumours out there that there’s 
going to be more bed closures, more job losses. Will they . . . if 
they’re so confident, will they at least come out, Mr. Speaker, 
and meet and talk to the people so they can talk about their 
concerns? 
 
There’s a senior citizens group right now fighting to save their 
beds; I’ll do a quote what they have in the paper: 
 

All of us are concerned. We are all over 80 and we want to 
stay in our own town . . . 

 
Along with the bed closures, four full-time equivalency 
positions at the health centre will be lost. 
 
Here we are trying to increase the population of Davidson 
and what are they doing — (they’re) getting rid of jobs 
and forcing people to move out of town . . . 

 
Mr. Speaker, my question again to the Premier, will he allow 
public meetings out in the affected areas of these closures? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, on April 30 the member 
from Melfort, the opposition critic for Health, was asked this 
question by a reporter: Is the Sask Party categorically opposed 
to any closures or conversions? And the member answered, no, 
we haven’t said that. We said that we would look at all of these 
issues on their merits. That would be, look at the statistics. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that’s what we’re doing, Mr. Speaker, is we’re 
working with the regional health authorities across the province 
to understand how things will change in particular communities. 
And, Mr. Speaker, it’s a challenge, but we’re going to do that 
because that’s what the people have asked us to do is to provide 
the best health care services we can in this province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Biggar. 
 

Radisson’s School Closure 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Mr. Speaker, my question’s for the Minister of 
Learning. Just a few weeks ago the minister announced what he 
called an historic reorganization of K to 12 (kindergarten to 
grade 12) education. The minister also announced a two-year 
moratorium on school closures beginning on September 1. 
Unfortunately that is six days too late for the families in the 
town of Radisson because the Saskatoon West School Division 
has announced that Radisson School will be closed on August 
25. 
 
Mr. Speaker, parents in Radisson are holding a public meeting 
tonight. They want the ministers to stop the closure and include 
the Radisson School in the moratorium. Will the minister join 
me in Radisson tonight to explain why he thinks the Radisson 
School should not be part of the moratorium on school closures 
and the NDP’s so-called historic reorganization of K to 12 
education? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Learning. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Mr. Speaker, the situation in Radisson 
is one that has been going on now for some time as the 
Saskatoon West school board tries to configure its school 
system. In particular this issue is about whether the students 
should be bused from Radisson to Borden or whether it should 
go the opposite way. 
 
The discussion that has been going on within the Saskatoon 
West division is a mature one. It’s been going on for some time, 
and as a result it is now at that final stage. We respect the 
board’s autonomy in this matter, and as a result of the nature of 
that discussion and the length of it, the moratorium has been set 
to take effect after this year’s round of school closures. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Biggar. 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Mr. Speaker, if the Radisson School closes in 
August, 70 students will be bused to school in another 
community. Mr. Speaker, families in the town of Radisson are 
having a hard time understanding that decision since even the 
director of the Saskatoon West School Division admits 
Radisson School is a nice school, where the school division has 
spent thousands of dollars in the last few years upgrading it. 
 
And those same parents are lobbying the NDP government to 
move Radisson into the Battlefords School Division — a move 
they believe will save their school. Will the minister join me in 
Radisson tonight to listen to parents, students and residents who 
are trying to save their school? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Learning. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — I fear that the member opposite is of 
the mistaken view that the minister of Education, the Minister 
of Learning actually makes the decision about school closures. 
In fact those decisions are made at a local level by the local 
boards. The moratorium, we have asked the boards to respect 



1292 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

for the next two years, during the transition period, not to 
undertake that. 
 
We were very clear in making that announcement. Understand 
that it would not impact those closures which were on the books 
for this year. Members opposite knew that. We have made this 
point repeatedly. These issues are difficult ones, and indeed I 
trust that the Saskatoon West School Division has made them in 
the best interests of students.

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 

Amendment to By-Election Legislation 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
in the early 1990s the NDP were very critical of the Devine 
administration for refusing to call a number of by-elections in 
the last two years of its term. NDP Justice minister Bob 
Mitchell called it, and I quote: “ . . . a situation that cannot be 
tolerated in a democracy.” And the Romanow government 
introduced legislation to ensure that the premier must call a 
by-election within six months of the seat becoming vacant. 
 
(14:15) 
 
Last week, this Premier introduced legislation that will partially 
repeal Romanow’s legislation so that if a seat becomes vacant 
three years or more after the last election, the Premier’s under 
no obligation to call a by-election. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this change will allow this Premier to do exactly 
what he criticized the former government of doing. Why is the 
Premier trying to weasel out of calling by-elections? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, the member from 
Cannington wants to talk about the Devine era. I’ll tell you the 
difference between this government and their government in the 
Devine era, is that we tend to have to general provincial 
elections on or about the four-year anniversary — that’s the 
difference. You don’t see this government hanging on to power 
for five years or a day past five years like that group did, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Well the fact of the matter is, at the level of experience that 
we’ve had with by-elections running up close to the four-year 
anniversary, what has happened is because of our law, we’re 
putting constituencies through two, two elections within a 
number of months. We want to solve that, Mr. Speaker. It is this 
government that has put the spirit of timely by-elections and 
timely elections into place, and this legislation will continue 
that practice. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, the Premier says on or about. I think we’ve heard a 
number of statements from the Premier that were not quite as 

accurate when he said them to when he actually came to act, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this Premier was very critical of the former 
administration on this very issue. On July 10, 19 . . . excuse me, 
2002, the Premier stood in this House and roundly condemned 
the former government for letting the seats of Kindersley, 
Indian Head-Wolseley, Turtleford, and Souris-Cannington 
remain vacant for over a year. And yet, Mr. Speaker, each one 
of those seats became vacant after the three-year mark of the 
former administration. 
 
This means the Premier’s new legislation would allow him to 
do exactly the same thing that the Devine government was 
doing. Mr. Speaker, why the hypocrisy? Why is this Premier 
doing exactly what he condemned former Premier Devine for 
doing? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, the member of Cannington 
seems to have a slip in his memory here. It was the Devine 
government — his friend, Mr. Devine — who refused to call an 
election in the province of Saskatchewan for five years and one 
day. One more day, the Lieutenant Governor would have had to 
do it. And not much wonder — it was not just this member, at 
that time serving for Moose Jaw, who was critical of that 
government. It was the vast majority of Saskatchewan people. 
 
Mr. Speaker, here is the record. Here is the record of the Sask 
Party in government. They had a by-election in Kindersley. 
They waited 22 months to call a by-election in Kindersley. 
They had a by-election out there in Indian Head-Wolseley. 
They waited 21 months — 21 months. They had a by-election 
up in Turtleford. They waited 16 . . . You know, Mr. Speaker, 
why they had all those by-elections? Because those members 
were jumping off that ship fast as they could get off it, and they 
didn’t want to go back to the people. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, we put in legislation to ensure timely 
by-elections. We’ve made a commitment to the people of 
Saskatchewan that there will be timely general elections. And 
for the combination of those two, we think this change to the 
legislation is appropriate. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
while the Premier is changing his tune from 2002 to today, 
there is one thing the Premier is right on when he says the Sask 
Party government, Mr. Speaker. He’s talking like a prophet. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, this legislation might make 
some sense if we had set election dates, but we don’t. The last 
two NDP governments went more than four years without 
calling an election. 
 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1293 

This government can go up to five years, Mr. Speaker. That 
means the people in some constituencies could be without 
representation for up to two years or more. That’s 
undemocratic. It’s something that this Premier criticized, but 
now he’s setting himself up to do exactly the same thing. 
 
The Premier strongly criticized the Devine government for 
leaving voters without representation, and now he’s giving 
himself exactly this same right. Why the double standard? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, I hear a great deal of envy 
in the voices opposite because — you know what, Mr. Speaker? 
— they will never get to call an election in the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Now the fact of the matter, Mr. Speaker, 
is that the violation, the violation of the principle of honour 
about the four-year anniversary, the violation has always come 
from that group of men and women opposite, Mr. Speaker. Now 
the fact of the matter is when you approach that fourth 
anniversary and there is cause . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order, please. Order, please, 
members. I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Now the fact of the matter is, Mr. 
Speaker, when you run up close to that four-year anniversary 
and there is cause for a by-election, it is an onerous 
responsibility on constituencies to run two elections within the 
course of several weeks or months, Mr. Speaker. I think people 
with common sense in Saskatchewan recognize that. They’ve 
said that to this government, and we’re willing to make the 
change, Mr. Speaker. We’re willing to make the change. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, one wants to be very, very 
careful when the member of Cannington’s on his feet. The last 
time I think he was on his feet in this House he was talking 
about sandbags from the Wascana Lake. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, I think the only people sandbagging this Premier with 
comments are his backbenchers, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this 
isn’t just a hypothetical . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order please, 
members. Let’s . . . Order please. Let’s try it one at a time. The 
member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This isn’t just 
a hypothetical situation. Prior to the 1999 election, there were 
three by-elections that were held, seats that were vacant and 
by-elections held, all within the last . . . after the three-year 
mark, Mr. Speaker. Prior to the 2003 election, there were three 
more by-elections in seats that were vacant, all that became 

vacant after the three-year mark, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, is the Premier saying those people don’t deserve 
representation? That’s what he’s saying under the new rules. 
Mr. Speaker, the Premier can still call by-elections if the NDP 
think they can win the seat, but he can avoid calling 
by-elections if the NDP think they are going to lose, Mr. 
Speaker. Isn’t that what this is all about? Just one more rule for 
the Premier to manipulate to his advantage? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, this is somewhat hollow 
coming from this group of men and women. You know last . . . 
Only six or eight months ago they were saying that this 
government would never call an election because we were 
afraid to go to the people. Well then you know . . . Oh yes, 
afraid to go. We went to the people, and the people gave this 
government a majority government for the fourth straight term, 
Mr. Speaker. That’s what the people did — four straight terms. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, one wants in electoral law, like everything 
else, to apply some common sense. We have had a tradition and 
a record — at least when New Democrats are in government in 
this province — of having five-year elections, contrary to what 
they did when they were in government, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Common sense says if you’re putting constituencies through 
two elections in the course of months, that does not make good 
common sense. Mr. Speaker, we’ve put in place this law to 
correct, to correct the failings of that group when they were in 
government. We believe this maintains that law, and we will 
continue to work as New Democrats always have on a four-year 
election cycle. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well indeed 
this government was afraid to go to the polls, and so they used a 
fearmongering campaign to win. And the people out there now 
regret the decisions that they made, and they’d like to have a 
second chance at it, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order, please, members. Let’s 
be able to hear the entire question. Member from Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Premier is 
saying he’s not going to use this rule to his political advantage. 
He’s not going to try and manipulate the timing of by-elections. 
And I heard a backbencher back there holler, trust me. Well, 
Mr. Speaker, why would anybody trust this Premier? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Once more the Premier has been caught 
saying one thing and doing absolutely the opposite. He’s doing 
what the former administration is setting up to do, is to avoid 
calling by-elections. This Premier said that was a terrible thing. 
But now he’s giving himself exactly the same rights that he 



1294 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

criticized a former premier for doing. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this Premier’s words don’t mean a thing. If he 
tells you good morning, check the position of the sun. Mr. 
Speaker, why the double standard? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Well, well, Mr. Speaker, this may be the 
moment to remind members of this House of a commitment that 
I made to the current member of Swift Current who now sits as 
Leader of the Opposition, but who in those days sat as the 
Crown critic. I don’t have the Hansard in front of me, but we 
could refer back to the Hansard. You’ll recall it, Mr. Speaker, 
when I made a prediction and a commitment in this House that 
that man would be the Leader of the Opposition long before I 
was. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — That commitment . . . (inaudible) . . . by 
the people of Saskatchewan, by the people of Saskatchewan 
was made accurate. Mr. Speaker, we put this package of 
legislation in place to correct the abuse of the system, the raw 
abuse of the system that was inflicted on the people of 
Saskatchewan by members opposite when they were in 
government. Mr. Speaker, they held for five years before they 
called a general election. They held by-elections off for 22 
months until they were forced to have the election or the 
by-election. Mr. Speaker, this is the party, this is the 
government that has credibility when it comes to electoral 
reform. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 55 — The Regional Health Services Amendment 
Act, 2004 

 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to move second reading of The Regional Health 
Services Amendment Act, 2004. 
 
Mr. Speaker, The Regional Health Services Amendment Act, 
2004 further demonstrates this government’s commitment to 
quality improvements and increased accountability within the 
health care system as outlined in our Action Plan for 
Saskatchewan Health Care. 
 
The Regional Health Services Act came into effect in 2002, Mr. 
Speaker, and changes have occurred since then requiring the 
Act to be updated. Amendments to the Act will provide greater 
clarity and assist regional health authorities and health care 
organizations with operational issues. The changes will also 
facilitate policy development and service delivery. 
 
Mr. Speaker, The Regional Health Services Amendment Act, 
2004 provides the legislative authority to establish a diagnostic 
services registry to help further improve access to diagnostic 
services in our province. This will be an extension of the work 
that has already been accomplished to improve access to 
surgery through the Saskatchewan Surgical Care Network. The 
Saskatchewan Surgical Care Network has already earned 
nationwide recognition and there is every indication that it will 
continue to be used as a model by other jurisdictions. We plan 
to build on this significant work and apply what we have 
learned to the area of diagnostic services. 

Mr. Speaker, other changes being made will simplify the 
process governing changes in membership to regional health 
authorities such as a resignation, death, or termination of a 
board member. Another amendment will permit the minister to 
issue guidelines and directions and operating agreements 
between regional health authorities and health care 
organizations. This will allow the department to establish a 
provincial model contract to ensure consistency between and 
within regional health authorities. As well, Mr. Speaker, there is 
a provision that allows the minister to issue directions 
respecting policies affecting regional health authority 
operations that will ensure greater consistency across the 
province. 
 
Two sections of this Act are being changed, Mr. Speaker, with 
the intention of providing greater clarity respecting the 
processes for appointments, reappointments, privileging, and 
disciplining of practitioner staff that are addressed through 
practitioner staff bylaws and associated appeal processes. As 
well, the financial reporting provisions will be amended to 
ensure that the financial reporting provisions of the legislation 
are consistent with generally accepted accounting practices as 
set out by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. 
 
Mr. Speaker, a section of this Act that is worth noting is the 
establishment of a framework for the formal reporting of critical 
incidents. Saskatchewan is the first jurisdiction in Canada to 
take this step, Mr. Speaker, placing us on the leading edge of 
developments in patient safety initiatives in the country. The 
Regional Health Services Amendment Act, 2004 provides 
clarification of terms to reflect reporting requirements for 
critical incidents to both regional health authorities and the 
minister. This will help improve safety within the health care 
system by having health care providers work together to find 
solutions to system-wide challenges and prevent similar 
incidents from happening in the future. 
 
Mr. Speaker, The Regional Health Services Amendment Act, 
2004 not only provides changes to ensure clarity but also allows 
this government to move forward in key policy areas. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of The Regional Health 
Services Act, 2004. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of Health 
that Bill No 55, The Regional Health Services Amendment Act, 
2004 be now read a second time. Is the Assembly ready for the 
question? 
 
I recognize the member for Rosetown-Elrose. 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to 
join the debate on Bill 55, which is An Act to amend The 
Regional Health Services Act. Any time we see legislation that 
involves health care in Saskatchewan, in the official opposition 
we want to take a very close look at it because the quality of 
health care in this province has deteriorated and deteriorated 
extensively under the NDP government. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, we know that there is more pressure on the 
health care system today than we’ve ever seen in decades in this 
province. And therefore it requires very dutiful and very 
thorough examination of pieces of legislation brought forward 



1296 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

by an NDP government such as this legislation. 
 
We’ve seen pressure on primary care; we’re seeing pressure on 
regional health care in Saskatchewan; and we’re seeing a great 
deal of pressure on the tertiary health care centres in our largest 
cities. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the legislation has some impact on the registry for 
surgical procedures in the province of Saskatchewan, and we 
know that simply having a registry that tells us how far behind 
we are won’t necessarily shorten waiting times for surgical 
procedures and other health care procedures in the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
And so we want to make sure that the legislation brought 
forward by the Minister of Health will improve the quality of 
health care rather than continue to let it slide as it has under his 
watch and previous NDP health care ministers before him. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in our health care system in Saskatchewan, we 
have never seen more dollars put into the health care system 
than we are seeing put into the health care system today. And 
yet we have never seen services reduced as quickly and as 
dramatically as they are being reduced today with the closure of 
acute care beds, with the closure of long-term care beds, Mr. 
Speaker, with health care professionals leaving the province in 
droves, and a critical shortage of health care professionals in 
many areas. 
 
We also know that, Mr. Speaker, the number of nurses 
graduating and staying in Saskatchewan is at a critically low 
level. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, our opposition will be looking 
closely at this legislation. We will be consulting with the health 
care stakeholders and the users of our health care system to 
make sure that this Bill does not further deteriorate our health 
care as we’ve seen under the NDP administration up to this 
point in time. 
 
It is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, that I would now move that 
we adjourn debate on Bill 55. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Rosetown-Elrose that debate on second reading of Bill 55 be 
now adjourned. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt that 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Debate adjourned. 
 

Bill No. 56 — The Public Health Amendment Act, 2004 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to 
move second reading of The Public Health Amendment Act, 
2004. Since The Public Health Act was passed in 1994, the 
need for amendments has been identified to clarify or provide 
authority to address public health threats. Many of these 

amendments are housekeeping in nature, Mr. Speaker, but they 
also are important because they either clarify intent or reflect 
common public health practice. 
 
Mr. Speaker, examples of changes that are housekeeping in 
nature are as follows: defining the term medical laboratory, 
clarifying the term hamlet in relation to the provision of potable 
water and sewage systems, replacing the term Canadian Red 
Cross Society with Canadian Blood Services, and deleting an 
unproclaimed section of The Public Health Act which dealt 
with mandatory pasteurization of milk. 
 
Mr. Speaker, other amendments resolve outstanding issues such 
as removing the need for a minister of Health and a regional 
health authority appointed as a local authority to approve 
bylaws relating to the setting of fees for plumbing permits or 
fluoridation of the water supply. 
 
This amendment, Mr. Speaker, makes it clear that the local 
authority, or the regional health authority is responsible for 
administering regulations under The Public Health Act of 1994. 
This will then allow the local authority to request a municipality 
to abate a health hazard. This will recognize the local 
jurisdiction and responsibility of both the municipality and the 
health region. 
 
There is also an amendment to make explicit the authority of 
the medical health officer of a regional health authority to issue 
an order to control certain public health hazards. This 
strengthens the role of the regional health authority’s medical 
health officer to issue orders to control vector-borne diseases 
such as hantavirus and Lyme disease. 
 
As well another change will provide clear authority to a medical 
health officer, with the approval of the chief medical health 
officer of the province, to issue an order to a person, municipal 
council, or a corporation to carry out an order to abate a serious 
public health threat. For example, an order could be issued to a 
person or a municipal council to carry out mosquito control 
programs, including adulticiding mosquitoes for West Nile 
virus. 
 
As well, Mr. Speaker, another proposed amendment provides 
liability protection to a person or agency that carries out an 
order issued by a local authority, the medical health officer, or 
the minister, if that person or agency carries out that order in 
good faith. 
 
Mr. Speaker, The Public Health Amendment Act, 2004 is 
important because it deletes unproclaimed sections or 
unnecessary provisions of the previous Act, clarifies and 
provides the authority to address public health threats that have 
risen in recent times, and makes it clear who is responsible for 
administering regulations under The Public Health Act, 1994. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move second reading. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of Health 
that Bill No. 56, The Public Health Amendment Act, 2004 be 
now read a second time. Is the Assembly ready for the 
question? 
 
I recognize the member for Rosetown-Elrose. 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1297 

Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And again it’s 
my pleasure to respond to Bill 56, which is an Act dealing with 
. . . Public Health Amendment Act, an amendment of that Act. 
Mr. Speaker, again we in the official opposition will provide 
due diligence in reviewing this piece of legislation to see 
whether it meets the needs and provides the proper protection 
for Saskatchewan residents. 
 
I’ve noticed, Mr. Speaker, just on initial examination of this 
legislation, that it will affect the regulation and supervision of 
water and sewage needs of very small communities, and of 
course this is a great concern. It’s been a real problem in a 
number of smaller communities in the province of 
Saskatchewan where some onerous regulations for health safety 
in drinking water and sewage is placed upon the communities 
and they’re not given the resources or the ability to meet those 
needs. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s put some communities in a very exasperating 
situation of not being able to comply with the requirements to 
provide healthy and safe potable water and proper sewage 
systems. I’m not sure yet, upon initial examination, whether the 
legislation brought forward by the Minister of Health today will 
help these communities to deal with these needs. If it doesn’t, 
then, Mr. Speaker, the legislation is not complete and the 
government, the NDP government, still has a responsibility to 
do more in this area. 
 
Also I notice that the legislation has impact on communicable 
diseases and diseases in the water supply that by . . . or in water 
that might be created by mosquitoes. And as we know, last year 
was a terrible year for Saskatchewan as far as West Nile virus is 
concerned; we had more cases of West Nile virus in 
Saskatchewan than any province in Canada. It would appear 
that the NDP government was not prepared to deal with this 
kind of a crisis, this kind of a situation. We’re trusting, hoping 
that the worst is past and we won’t have to deal with a situation 
as serious in the upcoming mosquito season. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, we’ll be reviewing this legislation to see if it 
provides more solutions and more, more mechanisms and ways 
to fight diseases like West Nile and give communities some 
assurance that the government is on top of these kind of issues 
before they get out of hand like they did last summer. 
 
So therefore, Mr. Speaker, we’ll review Bill 56 to see how it 
impacts the people of Saskatchewan. Again we’ll discuss this 
legislation with stakeholders and people involved in public 
health, municipalities. They’re also involved in ensuring that 
their citizens have availability of safe water, proper sewage 
systems, and protection from diseases such as West Nile virus. 
 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would also adjourn debate . . . move 
to adjourn debate on Bill 56. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Rosetown-Elrose that debate on second reading of Bill 56 be 
now adjourned. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 

Debate adjourned. 
 

Bill No. 59 — The Ambulance Amendment Act, 2004 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to 
move second reading of The Ambulance Amendment Act. Mr. 
Speaker, The Ambulance Amendment Act, 2004 is being 
introduced to provide more consistent accountability and 
reporting requirements for ambulance providers across the 
province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this Bill repeals redundant and obsolete sections 
of The Ambulance Act and aligns new reporting requirements 
under The Regional Health Services Act. These changes show 
that ambulance service providers have been and will continue to 
be an integral part of our health system. 
 
Mr. Speaker, often a person’s first contact with the health care 
system begins as soon as an emergency service provider arrives 
at their side. The quality service they provide must be supported 
and we believe these changes accomplish that goal. 
 
Currently, Mr. Speaker, some health regions provide ambulance 
services directly while others have contracted ambulance 
providers. This can result in variations in reporting information 
and in the accountability requirements between regions. 
 
This amendment will repeal sections concerning ambulance 
provider contracts and will allow ambulance providers to be 
prescribed as health care organizations, providing services that 
will be subject to service agreement requirements in The 
Regional Health Services Act. 
 
The current ambulance operator contracts will remain in effect 
until their terms expire and will be considered for renewal. 
Contracted ambulance operators will be accountable in the same 
way as other health care organizations. They will be required to 
report critical incidents as part of a system-wide approach to 
improved quality and accountability. This will continue to 
ensure service and safety for those using ambulance services in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
(14:45) 
 
Mr. Speaker, this Act will also repeal obsolete sections of The 
Ambulance Act relating to ambulance boards and ambulance 
districts, as they no longer exist. Sections referring to air 
ambulance services will also be repealed, as the authority is 
already established under The Regional Health Services Act. 
 
As was stated in the Action Plan for Saskatchewan Health Care, 
2001, we will introduce provincial regulations for road 
ambulance fees to ensure greater consistency across the 
province. Mr. Speaker, The Ambulance Amendment Act will 
help us work toward the establishment of a new ambulance fee 
structure. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this consistency in reporting and accountability is 
part of the foundation upon which we will continue to improve 
emergency services in Saskatchewan and ensure that they are 
sustainable into the future. 



1298 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move second reading of The 
Ambulance Amendment Act, 2004. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of Health 
that Bill No. 59, The Ambulance Amendment Act, 2004 be now 
read a second time. Is the Assembly ready for the question? 
 
I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s 
with pleasure that I rise today and speak to the proposed 
amendments to The Ambulance Act that the minister is 
proposing. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this minister stands in the House day after day 
expounding upon how much consultation and communication 
that he and his department undertake in order to make the 
necessary changes to the health care system to provide a better 
health care system. 
 
And today again the minister said in answer to questions that he 
has listened to and consulted with the Emergency Medical 
Services Association and the providers of this health care. And 
as we speak, Mr. Speaker, the president of that association is 
out in the rotunda explaining to the people of Saskatchewan 
why he finds this Act so objectionable to their association. How 
much of a disconnect does not that indicate between this 
minister and the health care system generally? 
 
Mr. Speaker, the ambulance association of Saskatchewan has 
worked tirelessly to provide a quality service, not only to 
contracted providers but also the public providers. And 
SEMSA, their professional organization, represents both 
aspects of the industry. 
 
And they have tirelessly over the years since I’ve been the 
Health critic been at the very forefront of making suggestions 
and creating opportunities and a willingness to dialogue with 
the Department of Health and this government in order to 
improve the services that are provided. On a consistent basis, 
year after year, they have stood in this province and indicated 
that they’re willing to always achieve a higher level of 
professionalism and sustainability for the system in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
And here now the minister is saying, never mind what you folks 
have said, never mind what your association has proposed, 
never mind the fact that this association has said publicly and to 
the minister that if the issues are accountability and reporting, 
and some of the other technical aspects that the minister talked 
about in his remarks, we’re willing to sit down with you and 
address those concerns. Because we want, as an association of 
professionals supplying critical care to the province of 
Saskatchewan, we want to provide those services consistently 
across the province — contracted or public providers — at the 
highest level possible, for the good of the people of 
Saskatchewan and the health care system. This has been their 
message consistently, year after year. 
 
Mr. Speaker, last year when the paramedics wanted to have the 
right to run their own professional association, because there 
was one discordant voice from firefighters, primarily in 
Saskatoon, the minister pulled the legislation. And he said, until 

we get more conformity and more unanimity across the 
industry, we’re not going to have this legislation come forward. 
Well how ironic is it now that this minister is determined to 
have this legislation move forward in light of the fact that 
SEMSA, who represents both public and contracted providers, 
are saying, we have grave concerns about what this is going to 
mean for our industry. 
 
Why will this minister not sit — and not just exchange letters, 
not just sort of have token hearing of their concerns — but sit 
down in a meaningful way and discuss these issues with this 
industry? The industry has said that we will deal with the issues 
of professionalism; we want to deal with them; we want to 
improve the industry and the quality of the industry. They have 
said, we’ll want to deal with the reporting and accountability 
issues. They’ve said that publicly and they’ve said it to the 
minister directly. And the minister simply refuses to listen to 
what impact this legislation is going to have on this industry. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I understand if this NDP government 
doesn’t understand these issues, because heaven knows they 
have little enough experience about the trials and tribulations of 
trying to run the services in this province unless it’s 
automatically in the public sector. But here you have a very 
healthy blend of both kinds of service deliveries, trying to make 
sure that the highest level of standards are maintained. 
 
But they don’t understand what it means to go in front of a 
banker and explain to him that you may or may not have a 
long-term sustainable contract that you can rely on when you go 
and need to spend the money to buy a new ambulance, or you 
have to spend money to equip those ambulances, or you have to 
train your professionals. Any of those issues have monetary 
concerns. And these individuals have to go in front of lending 
institutions and convince them that they’re going to have that 
contract long enough to amortize those costs. 
 
They don’t understand, Mr. Speaker, that if you suddenly put in 
jeopardy long-term standing contracts that have lived up to the 
full extent of the expectations of those contracts in terms of 
professionalism and reliability and accountability, because you 
can no longer count on those long-term contracts the potential 
value of the business you worked so hard — in many instances, 
family businesses — those businesses that you worked so hard 
to build and maintain at the highest level of professionalism can 
be put into jeopardy. Mr. Speaker, this government simply 
doesn’t understand that and I realize that that may be a truth. 
 
But what I can’t understand is why this government steadfastly 
refuses to speak to these individuals in a meaningful way and to 
accommodate their concerns so that both sides — the people 
concerned with providing these services and the hidebound 
elitist kind of attitude of the Department of Health — can’t be 
accommodated so that whatever the concerns are as expressed 
by the minister can be achieved in a more attainable and a more 
sustainable way for the future of health care in this province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s not many days ago that the government 
announced some pretty significant changes to conversions and 
closures of facilities in rural Saskatchewan. And they said that 
this is only the step that we’re taking at this time. And rural 
Saskatchewan is very concerned about what’s to follow because 
certainly the government, by the numbers they were looking for 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1299 

of saving in the budget, had a much more draconian plan 
prepared at budget day that they thankfully have backed away 
from. 
 
But the heart and soul of medical services, especially in the 
advent of trauma is going to be provided by the EMS system in 
these communities. And at this time when there is a fair bit of 
destabilization of the health care system, particularly in rural 
Saskatchewan, this is certainly not any time to destabilize the 
EMS system in this province as well. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly hope that this government will sit down 
with the representatives of the Saskatchewan Emergency 
Medical Services Association and have a meaningful dialogue, 
which means listening and being willing to accept the 
recommendations of this association in amending this 
legislation. And in order for them to have the opportunity to do 
that, in order for this dialogue hopefully to occur — because 
they know SEMSA stands ready, willing, and able to undertake 
that dialogue — Mr. Speaker, I move to adjourn debate. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for Melfort 
that debate on second reading Bill No. 59, The Ambulance 
Amendment Act, be now adjourned. Is it the pleasure of the 
Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Debate adjourned. 
 

Bill No. 60 — The Public Service Amendment Act, 2004 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister Responsible for the 
Public Service Commission. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased 
to present to the House for second reading, legislative 
amendments to The Public Service Act, 1998. 
 
These amendments will help ensure the continuing smooth 
functioning of personnel administration within government, and 
consistency with collective bargaining agreements. They will 
also create consistency between The Public Service Act and 
The Labour Standards Act with respect to employees taking 
leave to serve in political office. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the amendment to section 27 is a routine 
administrative change which allows for the delegation of 
suspensions by the permanent head within his or her 
department. This will enable better administration in 
government field offices, particularly with respect to managing 
the performance of out-of-scope employees. This amendment is 
consistent with the provision for suspensions for in-scope 
employees under the SGEU (Saskatchewan Government and 
General Employees’ Union) collective agreement. 
 
The amendments to section 31 are likewise administrative. 
They will re-establish the authority of the Lieutenant Governor 
in Council to make regulations prescribing how positions 

excluded from the application of the Act are to be dealt with. 
This corrects an inadvertent omission when revisions were 
made in 1998. 
 
The amendments to section 33(3) and (4) will create 
consistency between The Public Service Act and The Labour 
Standards Act by removing restrictions imposed on employees 
of executive government. 
 
A transitional clause has been created to allow for the repeal of 
this section to apply to current sitting members of the 
Legislative Assembly. These amendments will enable 
employees to take leaves of absence to serve as elected 
officials. Instead of being deemed to have resigned their 
employment upon election to the provincial Legislative 
Assembly, they’ll be granted leave so as to enable their return 
to their jobs with no loss of privilege at the end of their tenure 
in elected office, in accordance with the provisions of The 
Labour Standards Act. 
 
These amendments will make the treatment of public service 
employees consistent with the treatment of employees in other 
sectors, and will enhance consistency in provincial legislation. 
This is consistent with legislation in several other provinces and 
will ensure equity among all workers who wish to serve in 
public office, and to ensure that none are faced with more 
significant employment consequences. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I now present the legislative amendments to The 
Public Service Act for second reading. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister 
Responsible for the Public Service Commission that Bill No. 
60, The Public Service Amendment Act, 2004 be now read a 
second time. Is the Assembly ready for the question? 
 
I recognize the member for Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to rise 
today to speak to Bill No. 60, The Public Service Act. We 
understand this Bill has three provisions that are being affected, 
and the first one allowing a designate to suspend, without pay, a 
permanent employee in a department for a length of time that is 
considered appropriate. We understand that some of these 
decisions will obviously affect the efficiency and the 
effectiveness of the department, and it’s something that I 
imagine should be looked at with excitement by a lot of the 
individuals that are employed within our public service. 
 
The second part of this amendment allows a correction of an 
omission the last time the Act was opened. So again it’s 
something that I am sure that we will have an opportunity to 
discuss with some of the people that will be impacted. 
 
The third provision actually allows people the opportunity to 
run in a provincial election, which is something of course that 
many of us here feel honoured when we have the responsibility 
to represent people in our constituencies. I understand that this 
Act actually will allow them to have the same type of standards 
as The Labour Standards Act. Right now there’s two different 
readings within these Acts and of course they are conflicting. 
So this will give us an opportunity to correct that oversight. 
 



1300 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

Mr. Speaker, the many men and women that are valuable to this 
province when it comes to helping run the province need the 
attention of this Act, and we look forward to bringing it to them 
to discuss. 
 
And so at this time I would adjourn debate on this Bill. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena that second reading debate on Bill No. 60 
be now adjourned. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt 
the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Debate adjourned. 
 

Bill No. 61 — The Legislative Assembly and Executive 
Council Amendment Act, 2004 

 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, I rise today to move 
second reading of The Legislative Assembly and Executive 
Council Amendment Act. Mr. Speaker, section 40.3 of The 
Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act currently 
requires a by-election to be held within six months of the 
creation of a vacancy in the Assembly regardless of when in the 
government’s mandate that vacancy occurs. 
 
This Bill provides that the existing requirement for a 
by-election to be held within six months of a vacancy having 
been created in the Assembly will only apply within the first 36 
months after a general election. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the current provision could give rise to the 
situation where a resignation or death creates a vacancy late in 
the term of a government that would compel both a by-election 
and a general election be held in that constituency in an 
inappropriately short period of time. 
 
While the Act does provide that any by-election writ would be 
voided by the subsequent dissolution of the Assembly for a 
general election call, this would only be effective where the 
general election is initiated within the actual writ period for the 
by-election. 
 
(15:00) 
 
Mr. Speaker, the original intent of this provision introduced in 
1991 was to avoid a circumstance where a constituency could 
remain unrepresented for an extended period due to the 
reluctance of the government of the day to call a by-election in 
a particular riding. An amendment to limit the application of 
this provision to the first 36 months after a general election 
would respect this original purpose while avoiding the 
unnecessary expense of having to call a by-election relatively 
shortly before conducting a general election. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this Bill also provides for amendments that will 
specifically add five new positions that have been identified by 
the Board of Internal Economy to the list under section 11 of 

the Assembly-related appointments for which a member may 
receive additional allowances. These changes are intended to 
recognize the increased duties and responsibilities under the 
new committee system for the Deputy Leader of the 
Opposition, Deputy Opposition House Leader, Government 
House Leader, Deputy Government House Leader, and a third 
party House Leader. 
 
An amendment to create a new section 60.4 would specifically 
reference four of the five new positions and authorize the board 
to determine a sessional allowance for these positions. 
Subsections (2) and (3) of the new section 60.4 provides similar 
authority to the Board of Internal Economy to set a salary on an 
annual basis for a Legislative Secretary and for the Deputy 
Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this Bill also provides authority to the Board of 
Internal Economy to vary the level of allowances set by 
directive under section 67.1, during the period after the 
adoption of a report by a previous review committee, but before 
the appointment of a new review committee. 
 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, consequential amendments will also be 
made to The Government Organization Act reflecting these 
changes regarding legislative secretaries. All of the changes 
relating to the new allowances will be made retroactive in effect 
to January 1, 2004 so that they will apply to the current session 
of this Legislative Assembly as requested by the Board of 
Internal Economy. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to move second reading of an Act to 
amend The Legislative Assembly and Executive Council Act. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of Finance 
that Bill No. 61, The Legislative Assembly and Executive 
Council Amendment Act, 2004 be now read a second time. Is 
the Assembly ready for the question? I recognize the member 
for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well it’s a 
pleasure to rise today on Bill No. 61 which deals with the 
legislative council and Executive Council Act. In large part, Mr. 
Speaker, we agree with this particular Bill. It came before the 
Board of Internal Economy for discussion and members, both 
of the government and the opposition, were present and agreed 
to the changes that were being made. 
 
The one issue though, Mr. Speaker, that was not before the 
Board of Internal Economy was a new section 40.3 of this Act 
which changes the rules dealing with by-elections, Mr. Speaker. 
And, Mr. Speaker, the government minister introducing this Bill 
made a comment about the situation in place prior to 1991 and 
the reason why a change was brought in to the Executive 
Council Act to ensure that by-elections were carried out in a 
proper time, in a proper manner, Mr. Speaker, to provide for 
democracy to have a role, to ensure that every constituency in 
Saskatchewan was properly represented in this Assembly as 
legislation was passed, as the issues of the province were 
debated and discussed. 
 
In fact it was Bob Mitchell, who was minister of Justice at the 
time in 1991, who introduced this legislation and talked about 
the reasons why this change needed to be made to ensure that 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1301 

by-elections were held in a timely manner so that there 
wouldn’t be long and extended periods of time in which a seat 
would be vacant. 
 
He talked about the Kindersley constituency which was without 
an elected member for 22 months. He talked about the Indian 
Head-Wolseley constituency which was without a 
representative for 21 months. He talked about the Turtleford 
constituency which was without a representative for 16 months, 
and he talked about the Souris-Cannington constituency, the 
constituency that I currently represent, Mr. Speaker, which was 
without a member for 15 months. 
 
And I know that the members opposite are very pleased that I 
was elected at that next general election, especially the member 
from Moose Jaw North, Mr. Speaker, because he and I have 
enjoyed each other’s company in this House, Mr. Speaker, just 
as the member from Moose Jaw South and I have enjoyed the 
debate in the House as well since her arrival here, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And there are a good number of other members in the House 
that we have had the opportunity in this House to get to know 
each other, to exchange ideas, Mr. Speaker. And while we are 
all here for the benefit of Saskatchewan, we do have different 
ideas on how to achieve that, Mr. Speaker. And it’s that need, to 
be able to express the democracy, the ideas of Saskatchewan 
from all points of view, is the reason why there is a need, Mr. 
Speaker, to have representation in this House. Under the 
proposal that the minister is bringing forward we would . . . 
could have exactly the same circumstances all over again, 
because every one of those ridings that I read off — Kindersley, 
Indian Head, Wolseley, Turtleford, and Souris Cannington — 
all became vacant after the 36-month time period, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So this Bill would allow for exactly what the minister and what 
the Premier were criticizing at that time. They were saying how 
undemocratic it was, how unfair, how cowardly it was of the 
government not to call those by-elections and now they’re 
changing the rules, Mr. Speaker, to do exactly that, to allow that 
same circumstance to be repeated, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So if it was wrong, if it was wrong, Mr. Speaker, in 1991 that 
the previous administration had not called a by-election, then 
what makes it right today that the Premier should have the 
power to not call by-elections after 36 months into a term of 
election? That is exactly what the minister opposite and all of 
his colleagues and the Premier was talking about when this 
legislation was introduced in 1991 and yet now they’re doing 
the same thing, Mr. Speaker . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . 
Yes, the minister comments, both ways. That’s exactly what the 
government wants, Mr. Speaker. They want to be able to 
criticize the previous administration and they want to be able to 
do the same thing as what the government was doing at that 
time. 
 
I’d like to quote, Mr. Speaker, from the Premier of today, but 
something he said in 1989. When a political . . . And I quote: 
 

When a political party goes to the people before an 
election and says one thing, and then having won the 
election, after the election turns and does just the opposite, 
Mr. Speaker, that makes a sham of parliamentary 
democracy. 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — That is what that Premier, the current 
Premier said in 1989 and he’s doing the exact opposite today in 
2004. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the current Premier made some comments not so 
long ago as 1989, but he made comments on July 10, 2002. And 
he said in response to a question that I asked him in Committee 
of the Whole, Mr. Speaker: 
 

Mr. Chair, I appreciate the observation made by the 
member from Cannington that it was in fact our 
government that put in place the legislation to ensure 
timely by-elections. 

 
He appreciated that fact that he was part of the government that 
brought in a Bill dealing with timely by-elections so I again, I 
quote, “So I appreciate his observation that we have put this 
right by putting it into legislation.” 
 
We have put this right, and now he is trying to change it again, 
Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this cannot be allowed to happen. 
Mr. Speaker, at this time, I move that we adjourn debate. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Cannington that second reading debate on Bill No. 61 be now 
adjourned. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Debate adjourned. 
 

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 36 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen that Bill No. 36 — The 
Provincial Sales Tax Amendment Act, 2004 be now read a 
second time. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s a 
privilege to take part in today’s debate on this Bill regarding the 
provincial sales tax. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues have pointed out in the 
legislature many times in the past, the promises that were made 
in the election campaign of the New Democratic Party — and I 
have a copy of their platform in my hands — and on at least 
four different pages in the platform, there is no mention of a tax 
increase, a specific increase to the provincial sales tax. 
 
And in fact, it always refers to a tax cut. I quote from page 6. It 



1302 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

says: “ . . . continue to provide sustainable provincial tax cuts.” 
That’s the quotation directly from the New Democratic Party 
platform of the November election, Mr. Speaker. So, Mr. 
Speaker, there’s no question that the current government has 
reneged on its promise of tax cuts. They did not indicate 
anywhere in this document that they were considering 
increasing the PST (provincial sales tax) if, in fact, the desire 
was there. 
 
And in fact, the minister indicated that during the election 
campaign, it would not be effective for a party to talk about tax 
cuts because you might not, you know, entice voters. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, then that is exactly what they did. They would not talk 
about tax cuts . . . tax increases, I’m sorry. They talked about 
tax cuts. They didn’t deliver. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, you have — in various examples in this 
platform — the decision by the NDP to say we will support tax 
cuts. And in the end, we have a Bill that has been introduced to 
this Legislative Assembly that says we will increase the 
provincial sales tax from 6 to 8 per cent. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there have been continued points being raised by 
the Premier after that November election that reinforced that 
position that there be no tax cuts, in fact very specific that the 
provincial sales tax was not something that would be 
considered. And I quote from the Premier, a radio interview of 
January 8, 2004, when the reporter asked the following 
question, and I quote, “Do you have a mandate to change or 
raise the PST?” And the premier responded, “No, no.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, that was on January 8, very clear that from the 
November platform where there was talks of tax cuts, no talk of 
a tax increase. On January 8, assuming that consultation was 
going on with various groups in preparing the budget estimates, 
the Premier emphasized — or should I say re-emphasized? — 
that the provincial sales tax increase was just not on. The 
Premier did not have a mandate to talk about a PST increase 
and in fact to go ahead with it. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, what we see in the estimates and what we see 
in the actual NDP document are very much different. Nowhere 
in this document did I see reference to cutting of hospitals and 
the closing of hospitals. In the health care plan of the NDP, they 
did not talk about closure of hospitals. Mr. Speaker, they also 
did not talk about closure of long-term care beds, and we just 
saw the announcement from the Minister of Health that affects 
numerous communities where the long-term care beds are being 
cut — are being cut, Mr. Speaker. So that was not in their 
document. 
 
Another thing that wasn’t in their document was the closure of 
22 rural service centres. Mr. Speaker, 22 communities were 
drastically affected by this government’s plan to restructure 
delivery of services in the agriculture community. Why didn’t 
they talk about it in their platform? Was there something that 
they were afraid of? Well I would venture, Mr. Speaker, as the 
Minister of Finance would’ve said about discussion about tax 
increases, you just don’t want to talk about that during an 
election campaign. So therefore they didn’t talk about closure 
of 22 rural service centres. 
 
No, one other thing they didn’t talk about, Mr. Speaker, was the 

laying off of over 500 workers from the public service sector. 
There’s no mention in this document about decreasing the size 
of the public service sector and in fact laying off 500 
individuals. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, after the most recent health care 
announcement, we’re going to see upwards of . . . the 
possibility after regional health authorities are done with their 
cuts and changes, we may see an additional 250 people laid off, 
Mr. Speaker. That’s over 750 people that this government is 
laying off, no mention at all in their party platform that this was 
something that they were considering. Restructuring, whatever 
term you want to use, Mr. Speaker, it doesn’t . . . it did not 
occur in this document. 
 
(15:15) 
 
Mr. Speaker, most emphatically this document did not talk 
about a PST increase. This government has no mandate to 
increase the PST, and as a result they have introduced Bill No. 
36 that says it’s time to increase the PST from six to seven. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we’ve heard from people, especially from the 
western side of the province. Strong competition exists right 
now between businesses on the west side of the province and 
businesses located in Alberta where there is no provincial sales 
tax. Can you imagine now, if they were having difficulty before 
competing with the prices on various commodities whether they 
be furniture or whether they be recreational vehicles or articles 
like that . . . if 6 per cent was causing them a problem, what will 
a 7 per cent increase do? 
 
Mr. Speaker, I think this Bill will cause businesses to possibly 
shut down. And that’s not what this province needs. This 
province needs growth. And an increase in the PST is not 
needed. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this was not a promise that was made by the NDP. 
It was something that the NDP campaigned on that said they 
would not do it. The Premier of this province stated on January 
8 that he had no mandate to increase the provincial sales tax. 
And as an opposition we strongly agree with that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it is time that this Bill either be withdrawn by the 
minister or be defeated. Thank you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the one 
motion moved by the Minister of Finance that Bill No. 36, The 
Provincial Sales Tax Amendment Act, 2004 be now read a 
second time. Is the Assembly ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — No. 
 
The Speaker: — Those in favour of the motion say aye. 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1303 

Some Hon. Members: — Aye. 
 
The Speaker: — Those opposed to the motion say no. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — No. 
 
The Speaker: — I believe the ayes have it. Call in the members 
for a standing vote. 
 
The division bells rang from 15:17 until 15:24. 
 
The Speaker: — Order. The question before the Assembly is 
the motion moved by the Minister of Finance that Bill No. 36, 
The Provincial Sales Tax Amendment Act, 2004 be now read a 
second time. Those in favour of the motion, please rise.

Bill No. 1 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen that Bill No. 1 — The 
Financial Administration Amendment Act, 2004 be now read 
a second time. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Northeast. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise 
today to speak on The Financial Administration Act. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the opposition agrees with the overall intent of 
this legislation. We’ve agreed with the Provincial Auditor for 
many years that a move to summary financial statements, both 
in the budget estimates and the Public Accounts is a move that 
must be made in order to give the people of Saskatchewan a 
clear and unfiltered view of the state of their province’s 
finances. 
 
With 40 per cent of the government’s financial activity outside 
of the General Revenue Fund, simply focusing on financial 
reporting on this one part of government allows the government 
to skew the statement of our finances. And the NDP has 
certainly done that over the years, especially with the current 
Premier in office. 
 
The NDP government has been governing by simply raising 
debt and all the while claiming balanced budgets in our 
province. Government’s own budget documents showed the 
Fiscal Stabilization Fund being added to the General Revenue 
Fund as revenue and instantly subtracted from the bottom line 
as added debt. Still the NDP continues to prevent this as a cash 
fund. 
 
But while we agree with the intent of the Bill, we do notice an 
omission that we hope the government will correct before the 
final passage of this legislation. The Bill states that the financial 
reports will be completed based on the policies set down by the 
Treasury Board. And that’s it, Mr. Speaker. It does not say what 
these policies are. It’s wide open for interpretation or 
manipulation. 
 
To give the people of Saskatchewan a full measure of comfort, 
that the intention of the Provincial Auditor is followed with 
these reporting methods, we believe it is imperative that the Bill 
is explicit and that the policies used in preparing these books 
follow what is known as the generally accepted accounting 
principles. That is a very well-known technical term that is a 
term used by the Provincial Auditor. 



1304 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

To make sure, Mr. Speaker, that there’s no misunderstanding 
about the intent of these changes, we believe this must be put 
into the legislation. We would hope that the government would 
see fit to agree with this change in an otherwise positive piece 
of a legislation and we will discuss this extremely . . . 
extensively more in committee. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

Bill No. 7 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Sonntag that Bill No. 7 — The 
Automobile Accident Insurance Amendment Act, 2004 be 
now read a second time. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s a pleasure to get 
up to make a few comments on the automobile insurance 
amendment Act, 2004. 
 
It seems like any Bill that deals with SGI (Saskatchewan 
Government Insurance) is quite lengthy and there is quite a few 
amendments on this, being proposed in this particular Act. I 
know that we’ve sent the Bill with explanatory notes to quite a 
few lobby groups, because it does go quite across a diverse 
group of people and we’re still waiting on some opinions, and 

some concerns are being brought forward on this particular Bill. 
 
I know that one of the — shouldn’t say problems — but I know 
one of the concerns out there, it’s been brought to my office, is 
still with the SGI offices out there. People will come in — and 
everybody knows everybody out in rural Saskatchewan, you 
know — and they keep asking the person, should I be in 
no-fault, should be in tort, what should I be in. 
 
And I know that they’re not supposed to and they know they’re 
not supposed to give any advice at all. But I mean, when you’re 
sitting across . . . Like, a guy has told me, he says, when you 
know the guy, sometimes he’s related to you or whatever, you 
know, and it’s hard not to give advice. So they feel kind of in a 
spot that they’re not supposed to even mention tort or no-fault. 
 
And I know, even after they did their licensing, maybe six 
months later they’ll come back, gee I didn’t even know; I’ve 
just read this in the paper that they’ve kind of introduced this 
kind of tort system; how come you didn’t mention it to me and 
that. And he says, well I’m not supposed to really give any 
opinions on either or to even advise them that both of them are 
optional. So it’s a little difficult on that particular end there. 
 
I know another part of this Bill deals with a $5,000 deductible, 
and I’m not quite sure why that’s being reduced. I’ve been 
trying to talk to some people and find out what this particular 
. . . deals with there, with this 5,000 deductible. 
 
There’s also another section that deals with changes to 
insurance coverage in terms of, what the Bill deals with, 
off-road accidents. And same thing; I’m kind of concerned 
about that. Is that vehicles that aren’t normally licensed? Does 
that count as off-road accidents or is it service trucks, is it . . . 
 
You know, there’s some more information we’re trying to find 
out on that particular . . . how that affects people’s Ski-Doos, 
stuff like that on that similar piece. We’re waiting for some 
information back on that. 
 
There’s also a section dealing with hit and run, that I think 
there’s something to do with Crowns, government buildings, 
municipalities who do not contribute to the SGI Auto Fund for 
damage caused by hit and run and uninsured driver. Certain 
things there that I’d like some questions; we’re still waiting for 
some information back on that. 
 
So with that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to adjourn debate on this 
particular Bill till we receive some more information to some of 
these questions that we have out there. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for Arm 
River-Watrous that second reading debate on Bill No. 7 be now 
adjourned. 
 
Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Debate adjourned. 
 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1305 

Bill No. 29 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Ms. Atkinson that Bill No. 29 — The 
Snowmobile Amendment Act, 2004 be now read a second 
time. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, this is a Bill dealing with the use of snowmobiles and 
snowmobile trails in Saskatchewan which is a very important 
recreational pastime for Saskatchewan people and for tourists 
visiting Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
 
It’s also one that, over the past number of years, has 
encountered some difficulties when it comes to accidents with 
snowmobiles, some of which have occurred on the trail system 
— a good number of which have occurred off of the trail 
system, Mr. Speaker — but this deals with the use of the 
snowmobile trails. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there seems to be, though, a bone of contention on 
this particular Act. There has been letters of complaint about the 
Act written by the Snowmobile Association. There have been 
letters of a complimentary nature about this particular Bill 
written by the Snowmobile Association and there are . . . we’ve 
also received some letters from individual clubs that have a 
concern about this legislation. So it seems to be all over the map 
when it comes to either agreement or disagreement with this 
particular Act, and so it needs to be . . . a look taken into the 
Act to see just what this is going to mean for the use of 
snowmobiles, for the use of the snowmobile trails. 
 
Just to give an example, Mr. Speaker, so that the public can 
understand a little bit about the concerns that are being raised 
and — both on the positive and on the negative side about this 
issue, Mr. Speaker — I’d like to read into the record a couple of 
the letters that we have received. 
 
The first one is addressed to all Saskatchewan MLAs (Member 
of the Legislative Assembly) and is written by the 
Saskatchewan Snowmobile Association on May 5. It says, and I 
quote: 
 

I would like to inform you that the snowmobile trails in 
Saskatchewan will not be available to the people of 
Saskatchewan this . . . (upcoming) winter. This has an 
effect on each and every provincial riding in 
Saskatchewan. Please take the time to understand how we 
have come to this situation. 
 
The Saskatchewan Snowmobile Association (SSA) 
lobbied the NDP Government to pass legislation to make it 
mandatory that snowmobiles being operated on a 
designated snowmobile trail must have . . . snowmobile 
trail permit. In the fall of 1999 this legislation was put into 
place and the Saskatchewan Snowmobile Trail Fund 
(SSTF) was created. The minister in charge of SGI 
appointed the SSA as the SSTF Manager. The SSA 
proceeded to produce all the materials needed to put the 
trail permits into place. The snowmobile club signed on 
and (the) trail permits were made available to the public. 

Midway through the FIRST year (February 2000) the 
SSTF manager was contacted by the RCMP and told . . . 
there . . . (was) a problem with gazetting of the trails. The 
SSA contacted SGI and was told that the trails and maps 
must be gazetted. The RCMP then told the SSA that they 
would not be able to enforce for the remainder of the 
snowmobile season. Going into the 2000-2001 season the 
SSA met with the RCMP and were told that the RCMP 
would only give warnings to snowmobilers that used . . . (a 
trail) without a trail permit. In the 2001-2002 season the 
RCMP informed the SSA that there still remained a 
problem with gazetting of the trails. The SSA contacted 
SGI and was informed that there is no problem with the 
legislation. Going into 2002-2003 season the SSA was of 
the understanding that things were fine and enforcement 
would improve, trail permit sales would increase and our 
province would have SAFE snowmobile trails. The SSA 
continued on with trail permits as usual. This past season 
2003-2004, the SSA forged ahead, midway through the 
season the SSA received a call from a member club who 
informed us that the RCMP is informing the public by 
telephone that there is a loophole in the snowmobile 
legislation that the RCMP cannot enforce the trail permit. 
The SSA contacted the RCMP and asked what was going 
on . . . what this loophole was all about. This information 
was provided to the SSA. The SSA contacted SGI and the 
process began to amend the Snowmobile Act to close this 
loophole. The amendment to the Snowmobile Act is in the 
process at this time. 

 
Throughout this entire process the SSA was informed by 
SGI that there was no problem. The SSA has invested 
thousands of dollars to inform the public that a trail permit 
is required. Over the past five (5) snowmobile seasons trail 
permit sales (have) decreased. Over the past five (5) years 
the insurance to operate the trails has risen from $17,000 
to $145,000. In 2001 the NDP Government hired a 
consulting firm to undertake a study of snowmobiling in 
Saskatchewan. In the study recommendations were made 
to the province and the SSA. To date the SSA has 
implemented each and every one of the recommendations 
and the province has not. 

 
The SSA has informed the Minister in Charge of SGI that 
due to mismanagement of the legislation and no 
enforcement of trail permits the SSTF is without the funds 
to carry the required insurance. Without the insurance the 
trails cannot exist. Without the insurance the clubs cannot 
operate, fundraise or provide SAFE trails. 
 
Without snowmobile trails, statistics show an increase in 
FATALITIES and INJURIES. With this happening our 
province will see an INCREASE to HEALTH CARE 
COSTS. With this happening our province will see a 
Tourism Industry gone. Our province will see jobs lost, 
businesses closing their doors and a REDUCTION to the 
PST collected. 

 
The SSA has informed the Minister that there are 
insufficient funds to purchase the required insurance. The 
Minister’s response is “. . . (the) government has done its 
part”. They have done their part in closing the door on 
PUBLIC SAFETY. They have done their part in closing 



1306 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

the door on TOURISM. They have done their part in 
closing the door on SASKATCHEWAN. 

 
The SSA asked the minister to put together a group from 
agencies involved to find a solution to this problem; The 
SSA RECEIVED NO ANSWER. 

 
The SSA asked for a change to the way the trail fee is 
collected, the SSA was told NO WAY, WE HAVE DONE 
OUR PART. 

 
The SSA is now in a position where the public is informed 
. . . the snowmobile trails in Saskatchewan will no longer 
exist. SGI must be held accountable for their actions; their 
actions have cost this province the LOSS of PUBLIC 
SAFETY, A TOURISM INDUSTRY and THE PUBLIC 
CONFIDENCE. The SSA is stuck in a situation where we 
have no control over the SSTF (that’s the snowmobile 
trust fund). The SSA has had to rely on SGI for the 
legislation for trail permits. 
 
For the sake of PUBLIC SAFETY, to reduce fatalities and 
injuries help the Saskatchewan Snowmobile Association in 
SAVING the snowmobile industry in Saskatchewan. 
Please bring this to the attention of the Minister in Charge 
of SGI, (the) Honorable Maynard Sonntag, Room 38, 
Legislative Building, Regina . . . 

 
Mr. Speaker, the letter then goes on to point out some facts 
about snowmobiling in Saskatchewan. 
 

SASKATCHEWAN SNOWMOBILE FACTS: 
 
- 40,000 snowmobiles 
- 35,000 recreational snowmobilers 
- 15, 585 registered snowmobiles . . . 

 
So you can see from that, Mr. Speaker, there’s a significant 
difference between the number of snowmobiles and the number 
of registered; roughly one-third of the machines are registered 
and “5,400 trail-permitted snowmobiles . . . ” 
 
So you have about one-eighth of the snowmobiles are actually 
permitted to use the trails, and: 
 

- 0 charges laid for trail permits — RCMP (1999-2004) 
- $145,000 insurance costs for trails 
- 10,000 kms of snowmobile trails 
- snowmobile trails increase the safety factor by 66% 
- Saskatchewan’s #1 winter Tourism industry’s — 
snowmobiling . . . 

 
I do wonder though, Mr. Speaker, whether or not the hockey 
people agree with that statistics, or curling, or curling. The 
OWLS (order of wily legislative sexagenarians) know all about 
curling. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, “$22,000,000 annual industry (and) 1200 
jobs province wide.” 
 
The letter goes on to say: 
 

The . . . (SSTA) has made considerable financial 

contributions to inform the public of trails, trail fees and 
public safety. This was done to make (sure) the SSTF and 
. . . (maintained) snowmobile trails in Saskatchewan. SGI 
FAILED TO INSURE THAT THE LEGISLATION WAS 
DONE PROPERLY. The time has come that SGI take 
responsibilities for their . . . (action). The time has come 
for SGI to reimburse the . . . (SSTA) for monies lost due to 
the incompetence. The fact . . . (that) SGI made the 
mistake, (and) led the . . . (SSTA) to believe the legislation 
was correct, the SSA invested thousands of dollars. With 
the amendment to the Snowmobile Act (2003 spring 
legislature) is the proof that SGI failed to provide the 
correct legislation. With SGI failing to provide . . . proper 
legislation in 1999 the RCMP could not enforce the trail 
permits and this has left the SSTF without the funds to 
provide Safe Trails. SGI must take responsibility for their 
actions and provide funding . . . (to the) snowmobile trails 
until the STTF can operate in a self sustaining manner. 
Chris Brewer, CEO, Saskatchewan Snowmobile 
Association. 

 
And that letter was from May 6, Mr. Speaker. 
 
(15:45) 
 
Between that time and a couple of weeks, there was obviously a 
meeting held between the government, SGI, the RCMP (Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police) because a subsequent letter was sent 
to the minister in charge of SGI on this very issue. And I quote. 
This is May 17, 2004, Mr. Speaker. I quote: 
 

The Saskatchewan Snowmobile Association(SSA) held an 
emergency meeting of the SSA Board Members and 
Saskatchewan Snowmobile Trail Fund Representatives on 
Saturday, May 15, 2004 at the SSA . . . (board) located at 
Regina Beach. 
 
We’d like to start off by thanking you (and this letter is 
addressed to the minister) and your staff for addressing 
and making the changes to the Snowmobile Act. The 
RCMP has stated that the changes were required and now 
we will see if they will enforce the trail permit legislation. 
Our staff misdirected comments towards you and your 
staff based on information we received. Our staff has done 
research and spent time talking with officials at SGI. The 
information we have received from your staff at SGI is 
information that puts a different light on this situation. Had 
the RCMP charged an individual under the Snowmobile 
Act for not having a Trail Permit on a designated 
snowmobile trail, we . . . (were) told this would have held 
up in the Courts. For five years the RCMP have dodged 
the enforcement of the law dealing with the trail permit 
portion of the Snowmobile Act. We hope that the future 
brings the RCMP to the trails and we see enforcement of 
the Trail Permit. 
 
The SSA understands that you and your staff at SGI are 
not the cause of the problems that the SSA (is having) . . . 
are having but who are we to turn to? We are a small 
organization with two very large corporations that the SSA 
relies on, (SGI and (the) RCMP). When the system fails, 
where should we go? Our overall objective is to continue 
(the management) . . . to manage the Snowmobile Trail 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1307 

Fund and to provide the dollars (for) . . . to maintain safe 
snowmobile trails. The SSA Board is looking at ways to 
continue the operation of the Trail Fund. We are finding it 
very difficult as, without the RCMP’s support for the past 
five years this has left the Trail Fund short of funds 
required to purchase the insurance. We are looking at ways 
of finding the funds and hope to keep the trails open. It 
would be greatly appreciated if you and your staff could 
offer any assistance with the funding problem. (And) We 
ask that you support our proposal that you received from 
Mr. Chris Brewer, CEO dated May 11, 2004. Our funding 
problem is one that could be short lived. As we see 
enforcement of the Trail Permit we will see compliance 
that snowmobilers will support the Trail Fund and 
purchase a trail permit. Over time we will see 
snowmobilers getting into the habit of purchasing a trail 
permit. Our objective is to work with you and your staff to 
find a solution to the insurance problem. 
 
We are sorry . . . (that) any misrepresentation that has 
occurred and hope that you accept our apology. We would 
like to meet with you prior to May 27, 2004 to discuss the 
insurance issue. We may have some insight to a solution to 
funding problems and we need to discuss this with you. 
Would you please have your office contact the SSA to 
arrange a date . . . (for a meeting)? 

 
And this is signed on behalf of the SSA Board of Directors by a 
Mr. Barry Bradshaw, president of the SSA. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, so you can see that the SSA has had a 
number of problems dealing with this particular piece of 
legislation as it was originally implemented in 1999. It has 
meant that their trail funds have been severely depleted, that 
they can no longer afford to purchase the insurance necessary, 
and that they still need support from the government in the form 
of changes to the legislation to ensure that this takes place. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, it’s hopeful that this piece of legislation will 
deal in some part with the ongoing difficulties. However, it 
seems to be it’s also a problem between a misunderstanding or 
problems at the SSA, some misunderstandings of how the 
legislation should work and with SGI and the role of the RCMP 
in dealing with the trail permits. 
 
It’s also a bit of a problem, Mr. Speaker, between snowmobilers 
in southern Saskatchewan who operate mainly on private land, 
where the trails may run at the odd time alongside of a highway 
or they may cross the highways, but in large part they operate 
on privately held lands. They may go through a provincial park 
or over some Crown land but in large part it’s private land. 
 
In comparison to that though, Mr. Speaker, in the North it’s 
running mainly on Crown land and only rarely does it cross 
over on private land. On private land there is really no need for 
a trail permit, providing you’re not riding on the trail. But the 
trail, even then it’s only I believe, really enforceable when it’s 
on Crown land that it comes into effect, Mr. Speaker. So in the 
North, that means all basically of the trails are on Crown land, 
therefore it’s . . . if you drive, if you run on Crown land then 
you’re going to run into conflict or potential conflict with this 
piece of legislation. 
 

So we have a letter expressing some concern on that issue from 
the La Ronge Snowmobile Club, Mr. Speaker, and this letter 
was directed to the Premier, and I’d like to quote: 
 

Recently I received an information package, from MLA 
. . . Denis Allchurch, pertaining to proposed amendments 
to The Snowmobile Act. Please find attached my reply to 
Mr. Allchurch. 
 
As you will no doubt notice, I have one major concern 
with the proposed amendment to The Snowmobile Act. 
That concern is that the people of Northern Saskatchewan 
are being forgotten. The La Ronge Snowmobile Club in 
our endeavours to bring responsible recreational 
snowmobiling into Northern Saskatchewan, along with all 
(of) its economic benefits, has always been respectful of 
the peoples of Northern Saskatchewan, be they Aboriginal, 
Metis or others. Our club has always recognized that the 
snowmobile is more than a recreational toy to northern 
people. It is a main means of transportation. That is why 
we have always recognized that residents of the Northern 
Administrative District (N.A.D.), not just a few licensed 
trappers and commercial fishermen, should have free 
access to any La Ronge Snowmobile Club or 
Saskatchewan Snowmobile Association designated trails 
within the N.A.D. if and when they come to be. This free 
access to designated trails within the N.A.D. is basically 
the same privilege which is allowed private property 
owners in Southern Saskatchewan. 
 
Unfortunately, the present wording in the proposal will 
take this away from us. 
 
Therefore we request that the proposed amendment be 
further amended, by adding to Section 20.3 at the 
appropriate location a clause that may read like (and I 
quote for their amendment purposes): 
 

All persons with residence in the Northern 
Administrative District (N.A.D.) of Northern 
Saskatchewan are exempt from the requirement to 
possess a trail permit in order to use SSA designated 
trails within, and only within, the N.A.D.” 

 
Quote, carrying on from the letter, Mr. Speaker: 
 

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact 
me . . . Yours truly, Mr. Marshall B. Leswick, President 
(Mr. Speaker). 

 
So you see, people in northern Saskatchewan do have a concern 
that in comparison to those in southern Saskatchewan, which 
mainly use the trails as a recreational tool, whereas in northern 
Saskatchewan it’s used more for transportation from point A to 
point B, either for personal reasons or business reasons, 
whatever the case may be. 
 
So there is a need to have some sort of recognition, Mr. 
Speaker, in the legislation, that provides for the different uses of 
snowmobiles in Saskatchewan. And the legislation at the 
present time doesn’t seem to recognize that. 
 
We have a concern over the funding arrangements, Mr. 



1308 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

Speaker, on how this is going to work to ensure that the trails 
continue to be in place, because they do provide a safer 
environment for people to utilize their snowmobiles. But we are 
also concerned about how this legislation is going to impact 
northern Saskatchewan and the people who utilize their 
snowmobiles both for recreation and for business and personal 
reasons of transportation, Mr. Speaker. 
 
These are questions that need to be directed to the minister. 
These are questions that we hope that the minister has been 
taking into consideration, that he will be prepared to respond to 
the concerns that were originally raised by the SSA in their 
letter, which was not very complimentary to SGI, to the 
minister’s department, and to the RCMP, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So we will ask questions on those issues to see how they have 
been dealt with. The Saskatchewan Snowmobile Association 
feels that there has been some resolution to some of those 
matters. So we’ll be looking to see what resolution the 
government has provided on those very issues, Mr. Speaker, to 
how they have settled those issues with the Snowmobile 
Association or, if they’re not settled, how they propose to deal 
with those particular issues. Because the Snowmobile 
Association, obviously from their second letter, has different 
concerns now. They’re concerned now about how the funding 
will take place for their insurance, and whether or not the 
RCMP will actually carry out the enforcement of the Act on the 
snowmobile trails. 
 
We’ll also be needing to ask the minister how he intends to deal 
with the concerns raised by the northern snowmobile riders 
from the La Ronge Snowmobile Club on the issue of the 
differences between the use in northern Saskatchewan on all 
basically Crown land versus in southern Saskatchewan, mainly 
on private property, and how this kind of a regional conflict can 
be altered and dealt with, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Therefore to give the minister the opportunity to address these 
issues now that he’s heard the concerns on the floor of the 
legislature that have been raised, we would agree, Mr. Speaker, 
to allow this Bill to proceed to committee. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion moved by the minister for the Crown Management 
Board that Bill No. 29, The Snowmobile Amendment Act, 2004 
be now read a second time. Is the Assembly ready for the 
question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Deputy Clerk: — Second reading of this Bill.

Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that Bill 

29, The Snowmobile Amendment Act, 2004 be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Crown and Central Agencies. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the minister for

Standing Committee on Crown and Central Agencies. Is it the 
pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. 
 
Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and referred to the 
Standing Committee on Crown and Central Agencies. 
 

Bill No. 35 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Ms. Atkinson that Bill No. 35 — The 
Crown Corporations Amendment Act, 2004 be now read a 
second time. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to make a few comments on Bill No. 35 and I’ll 
be brief, and then we can move on to other business of 
estimates. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Bill No. 35, as indicated by the minister that put 
forward this Bill, was necessary to clarify, to clarify spending 
of the Crown corporations on the Wide Open Future campaign. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there is some uncertainty as to what the words 
clarify meant. And, Mr. Speaker, in this Assembly the minister 
was asked to provide a legal opinion that she said had been 
obtained by CIC (Crown Investments Corporation of 
Saskatchewan) regarding whether or not the CIC had actual 
authority to spend the money on the Wide Open Futures 
campaign. She stated that she had that legal opinion, and we 
asked for that legal opinion to be presented to this Legislative 
Assembly. And she said she would not do that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there has to be a reason why that legal opinion 
first of all was obtained, and secondly whether or not it in fact 
clarified that there was the legal authority for Crown 
Investments to be able to finance the advertising for the Wide 
Open Futures campaign. So that needs to be clarified, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues have made reference a number of 
times to the concerns of this Bill that highlight some things that 
are quite positive. And that’s of course providing for increased 
education of workers to ensure that skills are met for the 
workforce that will need them. Our concern, Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of so many private businesses in the province, is that this 
limits it to the Crown corporations, as indicated by the minister, 
that they be the only choice for employees. 
 
And that’s not what I think we need in this province. That’s not 
what is a partnership of private-public businesses. What we 
need is to have a broad approach. We need to be able to see the 
big picture. 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1309 

And I think this Act limits what benefits will be provided for 
students. We need to have students with opportunities to pursue 
private businesses. And it’s not just the Crowns that will have a 
large number of people retiring over the next few years. We 
know that the province of Saskatchewan, as we move forward 
over the next few years, will be affected by the baby boom and 
the retirement of many people from that baby-boom era. And 
there will be shortage of employees in private businesses, in 
Crown corporations, in government departments. 
 
So we need to be able to provide an education program for not 
only youth of both and Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal descent. 
We need to be able to provide a broad picture, a broad approach 
so that employees who know that there will be opportunities in 
Crown corporations, in private businesses, in government 
departments will have that ability to obtain jobs. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, I think that this Bill has looked at a very 
narrow focus, and it needs to be looked at much broader. Mr. 
Speaker, as I indicated the problem with this Bill is that we 
believe that the government did not have the authority through 
CIC to spend money in the Wide Open Futures campaign. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we also have been made aware by the Provincial 
Auditor’s office, by a memo dated May 27, 2004, that on 
Thursday, June 3, the Provincial Auditor will submit the 2004 
Report Volume 1 to the Speaker. Mr. Speaker, that report, we 
understand, may clarify some of the concerns that we have 
raised around government expenditures through the CIC Board. 
It will probably make comment on various components that we 
have raised in this Legislative Assembly. 
 
(16:00) 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, being that today is May 31 and we have a 
couple of days before the Provincial Auditor’s report will be 
received, it will enable us as an official opposition to take a 
good hard look at the chapter that I’m sure that the auditor will 
make comments about — about spending and about 
government’s control. And before that, Mr. Speaker, we do not 
want this Bill to move forward, so I would move that we 
adjourn debate. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Canora-Pelly that debate on Bill 35, second reading, be now 
adjourned. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Debate adjourned. 
 
Deputy Clerk: — Government orders. Adjourned debates, item 
no. 7, resume debate on the second reading motion for Bill No. 
48, The Vehicle Administration Amendment Act, 2004. Mr. 
Brkich. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — With leave, I wonder if we might 
stand consideration of Bill 48 until we deal with Bills 51 and 

52. 
 
The Speaker: — Is there agreement to go to Bills 51 and 52? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 

Bill No. 51 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Quennell that Bill No. 51 — The 
Limitations Act be now read a second time. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, we’ve had the opportunity to 
look at this Bill, and we’re not going to oppose the Bill going 
forward at this point in time. 
 
We have had considerable discussions with people that are 
affected by this Bill, and the concern that we’ve had expressed 
is the changes to what would be the limits on ultimate liability. 
Right now it seems to be an infinity plus six years. And with the 
changes to this legislation and the companion Bill that goes 
with it, Mr. Speaker, there could have some significant 
ramifications for buildings and products that have latent defects 
that don’t manifest themselves until after the ultimate limitation 
period has expired. It’s something we will discuss more at a 
committee level, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion moved by the Minister of Justice that Bill No. 51, The 
Limitations Act be now read a second time. Is the Assembly 
ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question.

May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1311 

The Chair: — Administration (AG01). I recognize the member 
for Thunder Creek. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Mr. 
Minister, for introducing your officials. And I’d like to take this 
opportunity to welcome the department officials to the 
Assembly today and we appreciate the assistance that you 
always give us when you’re here. And with that I’ll turn the 
beginning of the questioning over to my colleague from 
Humboldt. 
 
The Chair: — I recognize the member for Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have a question 
related to crop insurance. And on January 27, 2004 the federal 
government had a news release entitled, “Minister Speller 
Announces Tax Provisions for Farmers”. It announced that 
2003 income tax deferral option that they offered to producers 
of livestock because of the drought. In the news release they 
stated, and I quote: 
 

The drought-related tax deferral was made after reviewing 
soil moisture, precipitation levels and forage yield for the 
2003 growing season, and provides a management option 
to owners of breeding livestock who were forced to sell all 
or part of their herd due to drought conditions affecting 
feed or water supplies. 

 
Included with the news release, Mr. Chair, was a list of the rural 
municipalities that were designated as significant drought areas. 
And on that list was the RM (rural municipality) of Prince 
Albert No. 461 and the RM of Shellbrook No. 493. These RMs, 
although deemed to be significant drought areas by the criteria 
of the federal government, I have been told that they did not 
qualify for the rainfall insurance for their pasture land through 
their crop insurance. 
 
Can the minister explain the discrepancy of why the federal 
government deemed them to be a significant drought area but 
the provincial government did not? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Under the provincial program it 
basically covers rainfall in the April, May, June, July period, up 
to July 31. And the first three months are weighted at about 30 
per cent, and the last at 10. 
 
And we did, in terms of sharing of information, this information 
was shared with the federal government as they designed their 
program and determined what they would categorize as a 
drought area as well. But because of the parameters that we set 
for our program, it’s different from what . . . the criteria that the 
federal government was using. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, from the minister’s answer can I 
deduct that the federal government was more lenient in their 
program than the provincial government? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — In our program we’re insuring against 
variation on the historical averages, and we’re trying to make 
sure that with the end date of July 31 that, for those producers 
who are needing to purchase feed based on what they’ve been 
able to produce and generate with rainfall in their area, that they 
have time to be able to make arrangements for the feed 

purchase. 
 
(16:15) 
 
The federal government program is different. It’s a tax-based 
program and on that program they’re not looking at . . . They 
may, in terms of their parameters they’re not looking 
necessarily at historic averages. And so in terms of whether or 
not it’s more lenient, all I can say to you is I guess one would 
make that judgment. 
 
But from our perspective they’re very different programs, 
designed for a different reason. And this program is an 
insurance to make sure if there is need for feed, it can be 
determined in a timely manner so that the producers will be able 
to purchase feed if they’re short. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. Chair, I 
would like to change my questions now and return to something 
that we talked about the last time that Agriculture estimates 
were up and that is the agricultural policy framework. 
 
I would have a couple of questions on a few of the components 
of the agricultural policy framework other than the risk 
management component. And one of those is the environment 
component. And again returning to the news release from the 
provincial government dated December 22, 2003, there was a 
paragraph under the category of the environment that reads, and 
I quote: 
 

The Conservation Cover Program . . . will promote land 
stewardship through soil conservation, water resource 
protection, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and 
conservation of biodiversity. 

 
The total investment that was committed to that was $19.94 
million. Now with the new budget or with this year’s budget, 
the government is saying that they are no longer going to 
continue with that program even though they announced a 
commitment of money just four months ago. Can the minister 
explain what’s going to happen to the committed $19.94 
million? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — In terms of the press release, I 
understand that is a federal government press release and 
referring to the overall program. It is true that we have 
discontinued our conservation cover program and the funding 
that was directly headed towards that. 
 
But in the process of trying to make sure that we still get the 
matching funds from the federal government on their 
conservation cover side, we have brought forward a number of 
programs which we’re in discussion with the federal 
government on that may in fact qualify, so that we will get the 
60 per cent contribution and will have matching programs that 
will be accounted for in that process. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, I need to correct the minister 
because it definitely is a provincial government news release. 
And what I’m reading from is the backgrounder that came with 
that news release, but it came from the Legislative Building in 
Regina. 
 



1312 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

But at any rate, the minister is suggesting that they still want or 
still intend on contributing money to environmental or 
conservation programs, but we don’t know what those programs 
are yet. And yet we had one that was . . . I know in the past the 
opposition said that it wasn’t enough land per year that could be 
covered with conservation cover program, but it was 
well-received. And it’s one that we already are administering. 
 
What happened to the applications that were there and sitting on 
the desk waiting for approval when this program was cancelled? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Basically the program is on the fiscal 
year, and it was not renewed with this budget. And therefore 
those who had applications that were in in the time frame that 
was necessary for the ’03 program, they were paid out. And it 
was not renewed for this year, so anybody that was anticipating 
a program will not be covered. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — I’m going to move to a different component 
of the agriculture policy framework, and that was the renewal 
component. And again I will read from the same press release: 
 

Support for the Farm Family Opportunities Initiative will 
help farm families in Saskatchewan find new ways of 
improving their farm income situation through 
diversification or expansion, development of new skills, or 
the creation of a new business. 

 
The total investment that the government had committed was 
$24.19 million. That program was scrapped as well with the 
most recent budget, even though there was a commitment of 
money to the program as late as December 22, 2003. 
 
Can the minister tell us where he’s going to redirect the 24.19 
million that was committed to the farm family opportunities 
initiative program? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Once again it’s a combination of 
federal dollars in the report there. Our budget would be about 
4.3 million annually for the FFOI (farm family opportunities 
initiative) and that was again simply not renewed for this year. 
 
In terms of the matching side of that with the federal 
government, both existing programs and services that the 
department officers . . . offers, pardon me, will be used to help 
qualify for the federal contribution. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, could the minister please tell us 
what happened to the applications that were sitting on the desk 
waiting for approval on this program? Because I do know there 
was some sitting there and they were waiting for approval and 
then, of course, the program was discontinued. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — For those folks who were approved 
under the FFOI program, there was a letter mailed out, 
registered letter mailed out on budget day. And it gave them up 
until the receipt of that letter . . . any expenses that they had 
receipted up until that day would be eligible. They could be sent 
in to the department for refund and coverage under the program. 
 
If the applications had not been approved by that day and the 
change in program, or the pulling of the program, then they 
were not eligible under the program. But they would have had 

to have been approved in order to be eligible for any support 
under that program. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, underneath the renewal 
component there also was an entry of business advisory services 
with the dedication of $38.47 million. Could he please tell us 
what the business advisory services would entail? Is this just a 
matter of gathering information in an office space, and then if 
someone contacted those offices they could access the 
information? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — The funding that is referred to there is 
primarily federal funding. It is federal funding. And under the 
Canadian farm business advisory services there are three 
components. There is the business assessment and action 
planning, and there is specialized business planning services, 
and then planning and assessment for value-added enterprises. 
And there is also a second component of support that is 
provided, and that is the Canadian agricultural skills service. 
And those are provided within that budget framework of the 
federal government. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, just for a clarification, the 
business advisory services is fully federally funded? 
 
(16:30) 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — The money that goes to the farmers is 
from the federal government, but the province does provide 
some of the staffing in the programs. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Perhaps the minister could tell us if the 
agriculture enterprise program, which is also listed under 
renewal . . . It sounds very similar in the description to the farm 
family opportunities initiative because it says the agriculture 
enterprise program will provide support for farmers and/or their 
spouses so they may improve the profitability of the farm and 
increase family income by generating new business 
opportunities and employment. The total investment committed 
is $21.96 million. Is that totally federally funded as well? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Yes, that is a federally funded 
program and we’re still waiting for some of the details to be 
rolled out on that. But it is federally funded. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, it sounds from the minister that 
any of the programs that the federal government committed to 
and will fund we’re keeping, and any of the programs that the 
provincial government is supposed to cost share, we’re tossing 
them out. We’re scrapping them and there is absolutely no 
details as to what’s going to replace them. Are we going to lose 
the federal portion of that funding because we’re tossing the 
programs and not honouring our financial commitment to them? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — I think it’s important to note that in 
relationship with the federal government on these cost-shared 
programs we are in fact honouring our commitment, given the 
parameters that we have in working with the federal 
government. 
 
And in terms of the programs that we have decided not to fund, 
we have brought forward then some programs which are 
services, some which are provided by our staff, but they do 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1313 

qualify as programs that will fit in terms of our cost sharing, our 
40 per cent of the 60/40 split. And so with the existing 
programs that we have that we brought forward for 
qualification, though it is not new money, we are covering off 
our 40 per cent. And I think it is also important to note that in 
the first year where we did have those other programs, that the 
funding that was expended by the provincial government there 
also counts in terms of our 40 per cent of the funding. 
 
So in fact we do, we will be honouring our agreements with the 
federal government in terms of providing corresponding 
programs or services that will account for our 40 per cent. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — It’s interesting, Mr. Chair. When the 
programs, in particular the two that I’d mentioned, the 
Conservation Cover Program as well as the farm family 
opportunities initiative, were introduced, the government was 
more than happy to be upfront about it. There was news 
releases on it describing the initiative, championing the fact that 
the government was doing something for farm families and 
rural Saskatchewan. And yet now, with whatever programs he’s 
alluding to that they’re going to go to, to, you know, fill their 
cost-share obligation, there’s no description to those programs. 
There’s no . . . we have no idea what they even are. So what’s 
the secret? We’ve scrapped some programs that we had 
committed dollars to and supposedly they’re being replaced 
with something. So what is the something and how does it help 
the farm families? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you. I think it’s very important 
to take a look at the broader picture in terms of our decision 
making. And I know the member is aware that we went 
approximately $130 million over budget last year to meet 
programs in the agriculture sector because of the extreme need, 
the circumstances that we were in — both with another very 
difficult year in terms of crop production, and also with BSE 
(bovine spongiform encephalopathy). And the provincial 
government came on board with significant extra funding there. 
 
And so when we were looking at the budgeting for this year, we 
were compelled to make some very, very difficult and 
challenging decisions. And in making those decisions we 
looked at some of the programs that were new and we looked 
for ways that we could — within the parameters that the federal 
government sets — still meet the criteria that are important to 
meet in order to get the full funding for the APF (agricultural 
policy framework). And we believe that with . . . in our 
discussion with the federal government, and they are in 
agreement with this — we find that the same thing is happening 
in other provinces — that we’re shifting to look at some of the 
programs and services that we are providing as the qualifiers for 
the federal support. 
 
And as far as we can see at this point in our discussions with the 
federal government, they are amenable to this and we think that 
in this way we will be able to provide the very best support 
possible to our producers. And we will be able to do, albeit 
slight, some recovery from the significant over-budget costs 
that we incurred last year. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, I’m curious whether or not the 
minister knew about the BSE and the difficulties with the 
economy because of the BSE and the drought on December 22, 

2003. Because that is when his government basically made 
these promises; that these programs were going to be available 
through the duration of the agriculture policy framework 
agreement and they were going to be funded and specific 
amounts were committed to that funding. So on December 22, 
2003, was the minister aware that there was an economic 
impact of BSE and the drought? Was the minister aware of the 
economic situation of the province? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — The economic situation of the 
province was becoming more and more apparent. We had 
another significant impact on December 23, which I think the 
member knows about. 
 
But as we look forward to budget planning time we begin to 
look at what is available in terms of resources, what is 
demanded in terms of need in the province, and priorities that 
were set in terms of health and education put significant stress 
on the budget and challenged us in terms of budget decision 
making. 
 
And so when we came forward we wanted to make sure that we 
were able to maximize the programs that were there in the APF, 
and so when that was signed we were looking forward to a 
60/40 split. We had some programs in mind that would fit 
within the criteria that we were expecting we would be able to 
use, but as we got further into the budget process we realized 
that there were other priorities that were putting significant 
demand on, and therefore we had to look for other qualifiers 
that would fit as we pulled back on some of the new dollar 
funding that we were anticipating and hoping that we would be 
able to put in place. 
 
So given the broader situation and the kind of ongoing target 
that a budget always is with the changes in economic situation, 
we think that we covered off the needs as fully as we could, and 
that we will meet all of the expected criteria for our 40 per cent 
contribution, and we will get the full 60 per cent from the 
federal government. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, you have to really excuse me for 
doubting what the minister just said that, you know, that they 
will meet all of the criteria when everything that they say they 
will do, everything that they have negotiated for, they renege. 
 
Now my husband and I farm, and there’s more variables in 
farming than I think than almost anything else. But you’ve got 
to be able to plan longer than one month in advance or two 
months in advance. You’ve got to be able to plan into the future 
when you make business decisions on your farm. 
 
Now these decisions were made and promised to the producers 
of the province merely four months before the budget. To say, 
to use that as an excuse that, well you know we have moving 
targets, etc., etc., it frustrates the producers of the province. It’s 
got to be frustrating the federal government because they 
negotiate with our province, they make deals with our province, 
and time after time after time the province is breaking those 
deals. 
 
Would it be possible for the minister to provide us with a list of 
what programs still exist under the various components of the 
agriculture policy framework? Because obviously, all of the 



1314 Saskatchewan Hansard May 31, 2004 

programs that were listed on December 22 aren’t worth the 
paper that they’re written on. They were just promises they had 
no intentions of keeping. 
 
Would it be possible for the minister to provide a similar 
document that would give us some indication of where the 
money’s going, under what programs, what will be available, 
and how it will be funded? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — I think . . . I mean, I catch some of the 
innuendo in the member’s statements and I recognize that that 
is certainly the general negative perception that the Sask Party 
puts out. 
 
But I think it very important to note that we have a long-term 
relationship with the federal government that has been quite 
solid in terms of working out arrangements and dealing with the 
contingencies and the challenges that our economies bring 
forward. And a farm economy that can change very rapidly due 
to weather, disease, or other elements that we have encountered 
over these last years certainly makes it even more challenging. 
 
But I think, Mr. Chair, one of the most important things to note 
is that we do have a very good, solid, long-term relationship 
with the federal government both at the political level and at the 
level of the officials in terms of working out arrangements 
within the parameters that we are capable of working in. And 
we want to continue to foster that good relationship that we 
have, and we want to make sure that when programs are offered 
that we can provide a solid base for our producers here. That’s 
what we’ve been working at, and that’s what we’ll continue to 
work at to make sure that the programs and the funding are 
there to give the best support possible to our producers. 
 
(16:45) 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Chair, the question that I asked of the 
minister — and he didn’t answer it — was whether or not he 
could supply a comprehensive breakdown of what’s actually 
going to be in the different components of the agriculture policy 
framework. 
 
With all his comments on the relationship with the federal 
government, he does not want me to provide an hour’s worth of 
quotes from ministers from the federal government, comments 
that they’ve made on this wonderful relationship that they have 
with our provincial government. If he wants them all on record, 
I’d be more than happy to drag them in here and I could read 
them off one after one after one. But the relationship isn’t as 
great as what he’s making it sound. They are very, very 
frustrated with Saskatchewan. 
 
So again, the question is: can he provide a breakdown of what 
programs are going to be under the different components of the 
agriculture policy framework and what money will be 
committed to each. And in addition, would he also provide how 
much of that funding will be provincial and how much will be 
federal. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Once again I think we see the 
difference in perspective and perception, and it does tend to be 
very negative coming from the other side as usual. But I do 
want to say that we’d be very happy to provide all the details 

once the agreements are completed. We’re working on those 
with the federal government, and there’s a very good, 
co-operative relationship. And as soon as we have full 
agreement on those items that are going to be included, they 
will be provided to the members opposite. And we’ll be happy 
to have them there, and also we will provide for the public 
perusal. 
 
The Chair: — I recognize the member for Thunder Creek. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Minister, still with 
regard to the APF, does each component of the APF have to be 
signed separately? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — There is one APF agreement which is 
signed, one implementation agreement which we signed, and 
now we are in negotiation on the chapters and the components 
that will fit in the chapters. And we will sign an amending 
agreement once those components are all put together. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Have any amendments to the original 
agreement been signed at this point, Mr. Minister? Have any 
amendments to the original agreement been signed at this point, 
or are you contemplating one final agreement? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you. Yes, there have been three 
amendments to date. There was one where interim payments 
under CAIS (Canadian Agriculture Income Stabilization) would 
be covered, but that didn’t apply to us since we had not made 
interim payments; one under the BSE payments under CAIS 
which we did sign; and then the one under the business risk 
management around negative margins and increased caps which 
we did not sign but it had the requisite number of signatures and 
therefore it is in effect as well. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Yes, Mr. Minister. I understand that the 
program is in effect because sufficient number of provinces 
have signed. Will Saskatchewan producers be eligible for the 
federal portion of the funding, the 60 per cent that is, for the 
additions such as the negative margins and the increased cap? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — In the program the federal 
government, because this amendment is passed, the federal 
government will be applying negative margins and increased 
cap in the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
It’s important to keep in mind that we have committed $99 
million to the program and it’s our anticipation that that will be 
fully applied over the program, and that the federal government, 
as I say, will be covering their portion of the program, including 
the negative margins which have now been agreed to. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. So just to make this 
perfectly clear for producers, Saskatchewan producers would be 
eligible for 60 per cent of the negative margin funding and as 
well the . . . perhaps the increased cap is a different . . . I’m not 
sure exactly how that plays into this. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — The negative margins in design are to 
be covered up to 60 per cent by the governments, but that of 
course is subject to the limit that we have of 99 million. So our 
portion of the coverage for negative margins may well have to 
be pro-rated. 



May 31, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1315 

Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Under the section 
entitled, intergenerational farm transfer, under the renewal 
plank as well, is that federally or provincially . . . all federal 
funding, or is there a component of provincial funding in that 
particular item as well? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Given our circumstances . . . It was a 
proposed program, the intergenerational farm transfer, but given 
our circumstances this year it was decided that we would not 
move it forward at this time. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Under the food 
safety and food quality planks of the APF, there’s $26.74 
million budgeted for that. Now is that all federal funding or is 
there a provincial component as well? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — We anticipate putting 1.75 this year. 
Over the life of the program, the figures I think that the member 
will have before him would be in the neighbourhood of 8.75, 
and that is over the life of the program. That’s what we’ll be 
aiming towards. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Before I ask this 
question, I will thank you and your officials for their help today. 
And my last question is: when can the member from Humboldt 
expect the material that you’ve committed to give to her? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — I will be most happy to get that 
information to the member, and to the member from Humboldt, 
just as quickly as we can get that. But as I indicated earlier, we 
still are working with the federal government to come to final 
agreements on a number of the factors there. But just as soon as 
we can get them to the members, we will. 
 
And I’d like to thank the member for the questions, and thank 
all the officials who have been here today for your diligence 
and good work, and we’ll look forward to doing further work in 
the future. Thank you. 
 
The Chair: — I recognize the Deputy Deputy Government 
House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would move 
that the committee reports progress on agricultural estimates. 
 
The Chair: — The minister has moved that the committee 
report progress on the Department of Agriculture and Food 
estimates. Is that agreed? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Chair: — That is carried. It now being 5 p.m., this House 
stand recessed until 7 p.m. this evening. 
 
The Assembly recessed until 19:00.
