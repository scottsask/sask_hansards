 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 1269 

 May 12, 2008 

 

[The Assembly met at 13:30.] 

 

[Prayers] 

 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Cut 

Knife-Turtleford. 

 

Mr. Chisholm: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 

through you to the Assembly, in your gallery, it is my pleasure 

to introduce Mr. Brian Hesje. Brian is the chairman of the board 

of directors of Fountain Tire, a tire-automotive services 

company with more than 140 branches across Western Canada 

and a company that is recognized as one of Canada’s 50 

best-managed companies. There are three stores here in the 

Queen City. 

 

Brian joined the company in 1984 and served as vice-president, 

president, CEO [chief executive officer] of Fountain Tire, and 

in 2005 resigned to focus on his duties as chairman of the 

board. 

 

Brian earned a Bachelor of Education in history and a Master of 

Business Administration from the University of Alberta and the 

designation of chartered accountant in 1976. He was also a 

lecturer with the faculty of business at the U of A [University of 

Alberta], and in 2000 was awarded the U of A Alumni Honour 

Award. 

 

Brian is actually returning today to his legislature. As a grade 

12 student from Birch Hills, he visited the legislature as part of 

their school program, and this was just a couple years ago. 

Brian has a keen interest in the history of Western Canada, and 

in particular the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, and is 

in the process of collecting information on the similarities and 

differences in these provinces and how that has played out in 

the social and economic realities of the day. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would ask that we all welcome back Mr. Brian 

Hesje, our family friend and a friend of Saskatchewan. 

 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize . . . Pardon me. Why is the 

member on his feet? 

 

Mr. Chisholm: — Mr. Speaker, while I am on my feet, I’m 

also pleased to reintroduce to this legislature my wife, Heather. 

 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 

Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, to you and through you, 

seated in your gallery, it’s my pleasure to introduce guests from 

Mr. Glasspell’s grade 8 class from Regina Christian School 

here in Regina. It was very nice to have a chance to meet with 

these students prior to session here today. 

And they posed many very thoughtful questions to us which 

we’ve certainly appreciated. I was impressed by the students’ 

critical thought, Mr. Speaker. And I look forward to what each 

of these young individuals will contribute over their lifetimes, 

and hopefully Saskatchewan will be the benefactors. 

 

I’d also like to welcome Mr. Glasspell, who’s no stranger to this 

Assembly, who attended your institute just a little while back. 

And I’d like to thank him for teaching democracy and 

parliamentary democracy within his classroom. And I’m also 

aware that Mr. Glasspell is one heck of a basketball coach. So I 

ask all members of this Assembly to join with me in extending 

welcome. 

 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Qu’Appelle Valley. 

 

Ms. Ross: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also would like to 

introduce to you and through you the Regina Christian School 

grade 8 classroom. We had a wonderful opportunity. There was 

numerous MLAs [Member of the Legislative Assembly] that 

met with them over the lunch hour. And they had some very 

poignant and interesting questions. 

 

So again I’d like to welcome them to our House and introduce 

again their teacher, Geoff Glasspell, and also the assistant 

teacher, Larissa Munchinsky. Thank you very much, and 

welcome to your House. 

 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 

Dewdney. 

 

Mr. Yates: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to 

introduce to you and through you to all members of the 

Assembly 36 students from Johnson Collegiate in my 

constituency. These grade 12 students are here today to see the 

proceedings of the Assembly, Mr. Speaker, to watch question 

period, and I’m sure to ask some very difficult questions at the 

conclusion later this afternoon. 

 

They are accompanied today by two of their teachers, Heather 

Findlay and Tammy Patterson. Ms. Patterson was also a 

member of the Social Sciences Teachers’ Institute earlier this 

year and it’s very good to see teachers bringing their classes to 

this Assembly so that they can see first-hand the operation of 

our democracy and have the opportunity to ask questions. So 

thank you very much for coming and I’ll see you all a little later 

on this afternoon. Take care. 

 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, I rise today to present a petition on behalf of Moose 



1270 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2008 

Jaw, and this petition speaks to improving health care delivery 

and reduced wait times for surgery in a plea for support for our 

expansion. 

 

And the prayer reads: 

 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to cause the government to take 

the necessary steps to provide funding for the expansion 

and renovation of the Moose Jaw Union Hospital. 

 

And is in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I present this not only on behalf of my 

constituents of Moose Jaw Wakamow, but also all constituents 

in Moose Jaw. Thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Massey Place. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I stand today to 

present a petition concerning the Sask Party’s decision to axe 

funding for Station 20 West. The petition reads: 

 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Legislative Assembly may be pleased to cause the 

government to immediately restore funding to the Station 

20 project. 

 

And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the individuals that signed this petition, some are 

from my constituency, from streets like Howell and Milton. 

There are also signatures from outside my constituency, from 

streets like Avenue N, Wiggins, Colony, Coy Avenue, Avenue 

R, Cairns, Avenue I South, Avenue 1 North, so from throughout 

Saskatoon, Mr. Speaker, both sides of the river. Thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Fairview. 

 

Mr. Iwanchuk: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I present petitions today 

in opposition to government’s Bill 5, The Public Service 

Essential Services Act, and Bill 6, An Act to amend The Trade 

Union Act and the prayer reads as follows: 

 

We respectfully request that the Legislative Assembly of 

Saskatchewan urge the new government to withdraw both 

Bills and hold broad public consultations about labour 

relations in the province. 

 

And as duty bound, your petitioners ever pray. 

 

And the petitions are signed by the people from Big River, 

Debden, Prince Albert, Buchanan, and Canora. 

 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Eastview. 

 

National Nursing Week 

 

Ms. Junor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. May 12 to 18 is 

national nurses’ week and this week gives us the opportunity to 

recognize the many and varied ways that registered nurses, 

registered psychiatric nurses, nurse practitioners, licensed 

practical nurses, and shortly nurse midwives contribute to our 

health and well-being day in and day out, 24/7 and 365. 

 

Each one of us has had an experience either personally or with 

someone close to us with a nurse. The care that a nurse provides 

touches our lives in profound ways. As an obstetrical nurse I 

still meet people who remember me at the birth of their 

children, now most of them in their late teens. 

 

As nurses we carry not only the responsibility of a patient’s 

well-being, but the broader responsibility to make our health 

care system stronger, a better place to work in, better able to 

serve the public, and to be better prepared to meet the future. 

Nurses take this responsibility very seriously and can be heard 

in many ways and places advocating for these issues. This week 

highlights nurses and nursing, but every day of every week a 

nurse is at work for you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 

Qu’Appelle Valley. 

 

Ms. Ross: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, on May 12 

to 18 is National Nursing Week, a time we set aside to 

recognize the tremendous contributions that nurses make to the 

health of Canadians. Last Wednesday, Mr. Speaker, I had the 

honour of attending the Saskatchewan registered nursing 

association’s member recognition awards banquet, an event that 

truly celebrates those that are leaders among registered nurses. 

 

In Saskatchewan we are fortunate to have highly skilled nurses 

committed to providing the best possible care to their patients. 

Therefore keeping and attracting nurses is a top priority for this 

government. In fact in February we signed a partnership 

agreement with the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses, looking for 

more ways to recruit and retain nurses. And we’ve committed 

over 60 million to support it. 

 

An Hon. Member: — How much? 

 

Ms. Ross: — Sixty. We’ve also invested 20.7 million this year 

in a number of ways of helping to attract nurses to 

Saskatchewan and keep them here. Mr. Speaker, this 

government’s promise to hire 800 additional nurses within its 

first term of office has already had a tremendous start as we 

soon will be welcoming 300 nurses recruited this year from the 

Philippines. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join with me in extending a 

heartfelt welcome to nurses welcoming to Saskatchewan — as 

well as the new Saskatchewan nursing grads — along with our 



May 12, 2008 Saskatchewan Hansard 1271 

appreciation for those nurses who have already dedicated years 

of service. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

SMARTRISK Program 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, today it’s my pleasure to share with you a bit of 

information about the SMARTRISK program. The 

SMARTRISK program is a national, non-profit organization 

which has become one of the leading injury prevention groups 

in Canada. In 1992, pediatric surgeon, Dr. Robert Conn, 

realized that more lives can be saved through prevention than 

through surgery and started the SMARTRISK program. 

 

In my community of Moose Jaw, the program operates in 

participation with the high schools, where students run a 

peer-led injury prevention group. Presentations are given with 

the goal of teaching students to recognize that injuries are 

predictable and preventable. Some of the most important things 

taught to the participants are to buckle up, look first, wear the 

right gear, drive sober, and also lessons about fire protection. 

The overall message of the program is that taking a risk is 

acting before thinking, while taking a smart risk is simply 

looking at your choices before facing a risk. 

 

Mr. Speaker, this is a very important venture and builds a very 

good base for young people before they move on to the 

workplace or into careers of their choice. And I would ask that 

all members join me in congratulating all involved with the 

SMARTRISK program. Thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Humboldt. 

 

Humboldt Broncos Win National Championship 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 

a few weeks ago it was my honour to acknowledge the 

accomplishments of the Humboldt Broncos who had just 

captured the SJHL [Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League] 

championship. Well, Mr. Speaker, the Broncos’ season didn’t 

end that day, and I am very pleased to rise today to continue the 

story of the Broncos’ season. 

 

Following the capture of the SJHL championship, the Humboldt 

Broncos played Portage of the Manitoba league for the Anavet 

Cup. Not only did they win, Mr. Speaker, but they swept their 

opponents from Portage 4 to 0, winning the fifth Anavet title in 

the team’s history. From there they went on to Cornwall to play 

for the RBC [Royal Bank of Canada] Royal Bank Cup — 

Canada’s Junior A national championship. 

 

I am thrilled, Mr. Speaker, to announce that yesterday the 

Broncos did indeed win the national championship with a 1 to 0 

victory over Camrose in the final. This victory is Humboldt’s 

second national championship and their second in the past six 

years. Also of note, Mr. Speaker, is that a team from 

Saskatchewan has been in the final six of the last eight years. 

 

[13:45] 

 

Mr. Speaker, these young men, their coaches, support staff, and 

the fans have represented Humboldt and the entire province 

very well. We are very proud of what they have accomplished 

and the way that they did it — with hard work, determination, 

and perseverance. Those are all strong Saskatchewan traits. 

 

Once again, Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to please join me in 

congratulating the Humboldt Broncos on their season and their 

capturing of the title of national Junior A championship. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Nutana. 

 

Broadway Art Encounter 

 

Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, a creative partnership is being 

developed in the Broadway business district in the constituency 

of Saskatoon Nutana. On June 6 and 7, residents and visitors to 

Saskatoon can enjoy Broadway Art Encounter, an event 

evolving from the partnership formed between the Broadway 

area businesses and local artists. 

 

This event provides an excellent opportunity for artists to unveil 

the creative excellence so prevalent in our community. For two 

days, local jewellery, painting, sculpture, stonemasonry, and 

other artworks will be showcased for the benefit of artists, 

businesses, customers, and patrons. The attractive display of 

creative work draws the interest of business patrons and 

prospective art buyers and creates an enjoyable atmosphere in 

which to shop, visit, and do business. 

 

The Broadway Business Improvement District is coordinating 

this event and suggesting appropriate partnerships between 

businesses and displaying artists and is working on suitable 

spaces available for the great variety of artworks. Businesses 

are also approaching particular artists to feature their chosen 

work. The Broadway Business Improvement District 

coordinators are preparing a program to advertise participating 

merchants and artists. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I believe this is a wonderful example of linking 

communities to the mutual benefit of Broadway businesses, 

artists, and all of Saskatoon citizens. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Wood River. 

 

Severance for Former Caucus Employee 

 

Mr. Huyghebaert: — Mr. Speaker, the NDP [New Democratic 

Party] have now turned their $6,000 fraud scandal and cover-up 

into a $131,000 bill to Saskatchewan taxpayers. And they keep 

changing their story about Jim Fodey’s departure. Last May the 

NDP member for Coronation Park told reporters over and over 

again that Mr. Fodey had resigned. But now in order to justify 

the severance payment, the new NDP caucus Chair is saying 



1272 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2008 

that it was an involuntary resignation. The problem is that 

doesn’t quite cut it either. In order to trigger a severance 

payment from the Legislative Assembly Office, the NDP must 

have sent a letter saying Mr. Fodey was dismissed without 

cause. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, that’s now three different stories. The NDP 

told reporters Mr. Fodey resigned voluntarily. A year later the 

NDP told reporters Mr. Fodey resigned involuntarily. And the 

NDP apparently told the Legislative Assembly Office that he 

was dismissed without cause. Which one is it? 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition needs to explain. He 

needs to explain why Mr. Fodey is entitled to $131,000 

severance package if he resigned. He needs to explain why the 

NDP keep changing their story and he needs to explain what 

they told the Legislative Assembly. 

 

Today I’m calling on him to table the letter the NDP sent to the 

Legislative Assembly Office authorizing this $131,000 

severance payment, so everyone can see if what the NDP is 

saying publicly squares what they’re saying privately. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Regina 

Lakeview. 

 

Saskatchewan Film to Debut at Cannes Film Festival 

 

Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan’s film, television, 

and new media sector is one of Saskatchewan’s fastest growing 

industries and has become one of this province’s most 

important resources for promoting our cultural identity. 

Pioneers of the moving image here in the province include 

documentary filmmaker, Dick Bird; director, writer, and 

producer, Evelyn Spice Cherry; and her cinematographer 

husband, Lawrence Cherry. 

 

Others have since followed their footsteps and Saskatchewan is 

now home to a diverse group of award-winning practitioners 

working across the documentary, art and experimental, feature 

fiction, and new media forms. I’m pleased to say that among 

that talented group of filmmakers is a constituent of mine, 

Stephen Onda, who has been an independent producer, director, 

and writer working in Western Canada since 1984. 

 

Today I want to congratulate him on achieving a Saskatchewan 

film first. His film Surveillance, a German-Canada 

co-production primarily shot here in the province using 

Saskatchewan film crews, will be making its premiere this 

month at the Cannes film festival, perhaps the most prestigious 

film festival in the world. It will be screened in the Un Certain 

Regard category, a section of the festival for films that are not 

part of the main competition but are considered to have artistic 

merit worthy of attention. 

 

I ask all members to join me in congratulating Stephen Onda in 

having this film invited to open at Cannes and in wishing him 

continued success in all his future endeavours. Thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

QUESTION PERIOD 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Prince Albert 

Northcote. 

 

Prince Albert Pulp Mill 

 

Mr. Furber: — Mr. Speaker, the minister said that we would 

have conclusion to the deal with Domtar several weeks ago, but 

it hasn’t happened. On July 10 of last year, the Sask Party 

struck a task force to examine the forestry industry in 

Saskatchewan. When I asked about the task force findings, the 

minister responsible could only say and I’ll quote: 

 

I’m not familiar with the report or even if there was a 

report generated . . . I’m not familiar with any kind of 

recommendations. 

 

To the minister: why should the people of Saskatchewan have 

any faith in a minister that can’t even get details of his own 

party’s review of forestry in our province? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Executive 

Council and the minister, I’ll take notice of that question. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Prince Albert 

Northcote. 

 

Mr. Furber: — He’s taking notice on why people should have 

faith in their government. That’s an interesting concept, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

During the election the current Minister of Corrections, Public 

Safety and Policing campaigned on the slogan, I’ll quote, “a 

vote for Darryl is a vote for the mill open and people working.” 

Now that the election’s over we see that the Saskatchewan 

Party has little interest in getting that P.A. [Prince Albert] mill 

running. 

 

The same member claimed that tearing up an MOU 

[memorandum of understanding] with Domtar was actually in 

the best interests of the people in Saskatchewan, effectively 

running from his campaign promise. The people of Prince 

Albert are wondering, was it all campaign rhetoric? Does that 

member put party politics ahead of his own constituents? 

 

My question to the minister: is the member from Prince Albert 

Carlton a representative of Prince Albert to the government or 

representative of that government to Prince Albert? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, in order to 



May 12, 2008 Saskatchewan Hansard 1273 

allow the negotiations to continue between Domtar and 

government, I’ll take notice of that question. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from P.A. Northcote. 

 

Mr. Furber: — Now he’s taking notice on credibility. 

 

Mr. Speaker, their handling of the Domtar deal can only be 

described as incompetent. First their candidate promised to 

reopen the mill if elected when clearly they had no plan of their 

own to get that mill running. The minister responsible claimed 

to have had discussions with Domtar when clearly no 

discussions had taken place according to Domtar themselves. 

He’s had meetings that were not reported publicly until 

uncovered in this legislature. He’s apparently been sitting on a 

counter-offer from Domtar since March. 

 

To the minister: why is it that we’ve had to drag him kicking 

and screaming every step of the way on this file? When will he 

take his responsibility to the people of Prince Albert seriously? 

Will he stop bungling and grandstanding in his place and finally 

get the job done? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, I’ll take notice of that 

question as well. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Meewasin. 

 

Accountability 

 

Mr. Quennell: — I’ll try another tack, Mr. Speaker. As you 

know we’ve raised other questions about Bill 31, the 

government’s unaccountability Act. On each occasion, the 

government said they appreciated our concerns and would seek 

the opinion of the Provincial Auditor on the Bill. We expected 

that . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order. I would ask the two members from 

Prince Albert to come to order. Saskatoon Meewasin. 

 

Mr. Quennell: — We expected that with the government’s 

alleged commitment to accountability and transparency they 

would do so in a timely manner. Last week we had a chance to 

ask the Provincial Auditor if the Bill had been referred to him. 

His answer, quote, “Not at this time.” To the government: when 

do they plan on keeping their commitment? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As the 

House Leader, I’ll be pleased to answer the question. Mr. 

Speaker, when it was brought to our attention that there were 

these difficulties with the way the Bill was worded, we agreed 

immediately to seek the advice of the Provincial Auditor. That 

letter has gone out, and the Provincial Auditor, when he was 

testifying in front of the House Services Committee, indicated 

that he would be reviewing the request in the letter and would 

be getting back to us at the earliest possible moment that he 

could and that we will look at that at the time. 

 

In the meantime, the Bill will stay on the order paper exactly 

where it is, and we will make a decision as to either bring this 

current Bill forward or replace it with a Bill based on the 

Provincial Auditor’s recommendations for fall. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Meewasin. 

 

Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, I guess it’s in the mail. I’m 

glad the Premier has come to his senses and went back to the 

status quo instead of upping the threshold for oversight in 

government spending. Once caught, he did the right thing and 

agreed to change back all 15 instances where he tried to 

undermine accountability and transparency. 

 

But the Premier’s unaccountability Act just keeps getting 

stranger and stranger. Aside from changing public scrutiny on 

spending in Bill 31, the Bill gives some interesting new powers 

to the Premier and his cabinet. To the Premier: can he tell us 

why he’s adding a section called awards of achievement to the 

communities development Act. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, I suspect that it isn’t good enough for the opposition to 

be satisfied with the fact that the Provincial Auditor is going to 

advise us and he’s certainly going to advise us on 

accountability. Perhaps we should send him another letter 

asking him to advise us about the accountability of that former 

government when they gave $131,000 to Mr. Fodey and aren’t 

able to get their story straight in terms of what the reason for it 

is. 

 

If they want accountability, if the opposition wants 

accountability, I’ll ask them a simple question. Will you table 

the correspondence you had with the Clerks in order to make 

sure that we understand what the real reason is for Mr. Fodey’s 

severance from this government? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — Just a reminder to members to address their 

comments to the Chair. Thank you. Member from Saskatoon 

Meewasin. 

 

Mr. Quennell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The change being 

proposed by the Premier we see as section 14.5 added to the Act 

which will mean the minister is responsible for the legislation, 

may make grants or awards to any group, municipality, or 

person who, quote, “. . . record of achievement in the promotion 



1274 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2008 

of economic and social development is of outstanding 

significance.” 

 

Well, Mr. Speaker, with such clear and specific parameters, I 

can’t think of how such a provision could possibly be used or 

abused. Mr. Speaker, we’ve seen the members opposite reward 

their friends with massive pay hikes, and it seems the trough 

just got bigger. To the Premier: can he please tell us why he’s 

introduced legislation that gives the minister carte blanche to 

give taxpayers’ dollars to whoever they think is doing a really 

good job of whatever, and why anyone would believe this isn’t 

just one more way they plan to reward their friends? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, this administration is very interested in transparency 

and accountability. We’re also interested in making sure that 

the decision-making process is effective and efficient, and to 

that end we recognize that it was a good suggestion for us to 

seek the advice of the Provincial Auditor. 

 

The Provincial Auditor has assured us that he will review this 

issue with some thoroughness and also with a view of what is 

happening in other jurisdictions across Canada, and he will get 

back to us in a very timely fashion. We will look at that 

information from the Provincial Auditor and make whatever 

decisions are necessary, either to bring this legislation that’s 

currently on the books forward in the fall, as the new rules 

permit, or indeed to propose and draft a new legislation that’ll 

be more appropriate to the recommendations given by the 

Provincial Auditor. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Meewasin. 

 

Mr. Quennell: — Thank you. Mr. Speaker, is the minister 

promising to have this matter of the grants reviewed as well by 

the Provincial Auditor, since that’s the last answer to his last 

question? 

 

Mr. Speaker, legislation doesn’t happen by accident. It is 

designed with purpose and intent. It’s designed with a goal in 

mind. The public wants to know what the Premier has in mind 

for this legislation. They want to know why the Premier 

believes his ministers need legislation that allows them to 

decide to give to money to anyone they see fit. Just like we 

needed to know what the government was planning to cover up 

by changing its spending thresholds, we now need to know who 

they are planning to reward with this change. To the Premier: 

who is he hoping to benefit with this change of legislation? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

Hon. Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, the government is seeking to have advice from the 

Provincial Auditor on this whole matter in its broad sense, and 

we believe that that’s appropriate. The Provincial Auditor has 

indicated that he would seek the advice and what the precedents 

are and the practices are that are in other jurisdictions in 

Canada. So I think that that is appropriate and it’ll be very 

good. 

 

[14:00] 

 

But perhaps if the opposition would really like, you would like 

us to include the circumstances surrounding Mr. Fodey’s 

dismissal. And was he indeed fired? Well did he resign? Or was 

he fired with cause? Or was he indeed dismissed with cause? 

We can include that as well if the member opposite would like. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Eastview. 

 

Nurses’ Contract Negotiations 

 

Ms. Junor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I noted before 

earlier, it’s Nursing Week in Saskatchewan. Last Thursday the 

Minister of Health seemed pretty confident that, despite a strike 

vote, SUN [Saskatchewan Union of Nurses] and SAHO 

[Saskatchewan Association of Health Organizations] could 

reach a deal before any job action occurred. Yet we’ve learned 

that the government is rushing out polling to measure public 

opinion on the nursing situation. 

 

To the minister: was the confidence false bravado? If he truly 

believes the deal is imminent, why the panic polling? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. McMorris: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

Mr. Speaker, as I said last week, I’m very confident that the two 

groups are back to the table today. They’ll be . . . in fact their 

bargaining started earlier this afternoon. I think that you’ll see 

movement on both sides. You’ll definitely see movement on 

SAHO’s side, with a press release that was just recently 

released just after lunch talking about some movement. 

 

I said all along that I think there’s common ground. They need 

to get back to the bargaining table. And I’m proud to report 

they’re there today. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Eastview. 

 

Ms. Junor: — Mr. Speaker, it’s unfortunate we’ve gotten to 

this point. The minister has boasted that his MOU has helped 

the bargaining process, yet nurses are saying his good-cop, 

bad-cop approach is part of the problem. The minister says 



May 12, 2008 Saskatchewan Hansard 1275 

again that he’s confident agreement can be reached. But he’s 

the same minister who told us his MOU is an asset to the 

bargaining process, and we know that hasn’t worked for him so 

far. 

 

To the minister: the people of Saskatchewan want to know if 

he’s got it right this time. What gives him confidence that a 

negotiated settlement can be reached before job action occurs? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, I’m very confident that 

a negotiated settlement will be found. Certainly they didn’t 

spend much time at the bargaining table when they first 

exchanged proposals, only roughly 10 to 15 minutes. I think 

certainly the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses weren’t very 

happy with the SAHO proposal. They’ve had time to reflect on 

those proposals. There has been some time where SUN has then 

taken a strike vote at 77 per cent. That’s well within their rights 

— absolutely, Mr. Speaker. I think that you’re going to see 

movement at the bargaining table starting today. And I think 

that we’re going to see a negotiated settlement. 

 

But one thing I’ll also say, Mr. Speaker, I’m quite frankly 

satisfied and glad — and so is this government — that if things 

aren’t negotiated into a contract, there is a partnership 

agreement that talks can still happen around those issues, 

something that never would have happened under that former 

government. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Eastview. 

 

Ms. Junor: — Mr. Speaker, the minister admitted in committee 

that the relationship with the ministry and SAHO is very close. 

In fact there’s an ADM [assistant deputy minister] at the table 

and now the acting deputy minister. So anything that comes to 

the table through SAHO has come with the minister’s approval. 

 

And here’s what an RN [registered nurse] in the Cypress Health 

Region has to say to the Health minister, quote, “Please treat us 

the respect we deserve and ensure that a contract offered is 

meaningful, attracts and retains new and experienced nurses, 

and is reflective of the valuable service provided by SUN 

nurses to the residents of Saskatchewan.” Many other 

comments refer to the contract offered as degrading, regressive, 

and disrespectful, and as one nurse puts it, nurses are, quote, 

“disappointed and expected more from the new government.” 

 

To the minister: what does he say to the many nurses he has let 

down? What will he do moving forward to make sure 

Saskatchewan nurses can stay on the job to provide health care 

to Saskatchewan families? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, the question is really 

quite interesting coming from that member who of course was 

the president of the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses. I would 

think that she would understand bargaining a little bit better 

than what she’s displayed here today. 

 

You know that proposals are put in from both sides, and there 

could be extremes in those proposals. And certainly that may 

have been the case that was looked upon by many of the nurses 

— that SAHO’s proposal was extreme. But we needed to get 

back to the bargaining table so that those proposals could be 

refined, so that common ground could be found, and so 

agreement can be found, Mr. Speaker. That is the way the 

bargaining process works. 

 

Yes, maybe they were too extreme. Maybe they were too 

extreme on both sides. But if anybody in this House should 

know how a bargaining process should work, it should be that 

member. This is how the process works. I think an agreement 

will be found relatively soon. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 

Eastview. 

 

Ms. Junor: — Mr. Speaker, the minister is right. I do 

understand bargaining. That’s why I know that when he signed 

the MOU, he put himself at the bargaining table. You can’t 

distance yourself from SAHO as the minister. You are giving 

direction to SAHO. So the contract negotiations, the package 

that came to the table was with that minister’s knowledge, and 

it offended SUN and goaded SUN into getting a strike vote. So 

why did he go there? I mean what’s the point? 

 

Anyways my next question, Mr. Speaker, to the minister. He 

was at the Saskatchewan Medical Association this weekend. 

According to news reports, the minister was asked about 

public-private partnerships within the public system, and he told 

delegates that there could be more in the future. To the minister: 

can he clarify what he means when he says he’s open to the idea 

of expanding the role of private health care within our system? 

What particular areas does he see as needing more private 

sector involvement? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, I would challenge that 

member to table any sort of evidence that I said that I was in 

favour in forwarding private health care into this province. I 

spoke at the SMA [Saskatchewan Medical Association] 

convention, absolutely, and the question came up about 

public-private partnerships, public-private partnerships. And I 

said at that time that our government is looking at those, 

exploring those. They are done in other provinces, and certainly 

we need to see if that would benefit our province. 

 



1276 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2008 

We know that there is an absolute deficit left by that former 

government when it comes to capital projects, whether it’s in 

education or whether it’s in health care. We started to address 

that issue, Mr. Speaker, but we’re certainly open to the 

opportunities that have been used in other provinces regarding 

public-private partnerships, Mr. Speaker. I would ask that 

member to do a little more research before she stands in the 

House. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Salaries Paid to Executive Council Staff 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, one has to wonder what the government has to hide 

when they refuse to answer some simple questions about 

salaries the Premier pays to Executive Council. The Finance 

minister just spoke about accountability and transparency, but 

last week we posed a series of written questions to the 

government on the mean and median salaries of men and 

women working for Executive Council. 

 

Mr. Speaker, why has the Premier refused to answer the 

questions, and what exactly is he hiding? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, we have answered a tremendous amount of questions 

in this session, and we certainly are continuing to answer 

questions. We simply were unable to get all the information that 

was required of the questions that were asked, and so we 

ordered the answers to those questions. And as soon as we have 

them available — not the full 180 days that’s provided for — 

but as soon as we have them available we’ll be providing them 

to the opposition. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Well, Mr. Speaker, we have a series of 

questions about how men and women are being paid by the 

Premier in Executive Council, questions that reflect broader 

concerns about the government’s attitudes towards women. 

While we would like to be debating the current numbers, we are 

left to look at numbers from January which are still quite 

telling. 

 

The list shows that the average salary of men working for the 

Premier is just over $170,000 while the average salary of 

women working for the Premier is just over $62,000. That’s a 

whopping difference of $55,000 per year. When we look at the 

median salaries of men and women, the gap increases to 66,000. 

 

To the Premier: can he confirm or deny there is a significant 

wage gap between men and women working in Executive 

Council? And what does he have to say for this shocking 

disparity? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to the 

members opposite in my previous answer, we are working on 

the exact answers to those questions that will be provided to the 

opposition in very good due course. 

 

And I think that’s important to provide those answers, and 

statistically they are always information that is valuable to help 

all forms of government and all parts of government to make 

good decisions in terms of hiring practice. We will have that 

information to the opposition as soon as it’s compiled, and I’m 

sure that the opposition will find the information factual and 

useful. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, I need to correct. I think I said 

170,000 for average, and it’s 107,000. But the $55,000 

difference still stands. 

 

Mr. Speaker, it’s interesting to see how men and women fare at 

both the top and bottom of Executive Council pay scale. Mr. 

Speaker, 62 per cent of men working in Exec Council make 

over $100,000 compared to 15 per cent of women. And when 

we look at the bottom pay scale, we see that while only 1 per 

cent of men make under $50,000, over 50 per cent of women 

make less than $50,000. 

 

Mr. Speaker, women in this province are outraged at this 

flagrant disregard for wage parity and a poor example that’s 

being set by the Premier. To the Premier: how can he defend 

this unacceptable level of wage disparity in Executive Council? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 

you know, the House Leader has tried to respond to the member 

opposite by indicating that we will provide each individual 

request that has been given. 

 

I do want to provide some information to that member right 

now. The fact is that in April 2008 in Executive Council there 

were 69 staff. In ministerial assistant level, there were 84 staff 

for a total of 153. In the NDP government, Mr. Speaker, on 

November 2007, there were 180, Mr. Speaker — 27 less people 

that are working within this government, Mr. Speaker. 

 

We’re going to be delivering exactly what that member wants. 

But, Mr. Speaker, I do also want to remind the member that last 

year, when the then premier wanted to have an official take care 



May 12, 2008 Saskatchewan Hansard 1277 

of the problem at Fishing Lake, he hired a gentleman by the 

name of Bernie Churko — term of contract, April 30 to 

November 23, just under 7 months, Mr. Speaker; amount paid, 

$217,000, Mr. Speaker, for seven months’ worth of work. I 

think that they need to review their numbers, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, I want to re-emphasize how 

disheartening it is to see this kind of wage inequity among the 

Premier’s Executive Council employees. It has nothing to do 

with individual contracts. It has to do with the overview of 

Executive Council and where the wages are paid. Women have 

worked long and hard to prove . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order. Member from Moose Jaw Wakamow 

has the right to be heard as she places her question. Member 

from Moose Jaw Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, women have worked long and hard to prove 

themselves in all aspects of society. We have proved ourselves 

to be capable and . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order. Member from Moose Jaw Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, women have proved themselves 

to be capable and . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Member from Moose Jaw Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, women have worked long and 

hard to prove themselves in all aspects of society. We have 

proved ourselves to be capable and talented political advisers, 

capable of providing sound advice and strong leadership. The 

Premier needs to explain why the wages in Executive Council 

do not reflect this reality. 

 

To the Premier: how does the Premier explain a consistent 

undervaluing of women’s work by his administration? And 

please tell the people of Saskatchewan what he plans to do 

about it. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 

that NDP opposition has to explain a number of things, a couple 

of things when they were in government. I just mention the 

name Bernie Churko and why you would initiate a contract 

through Executive Council at $30,000 a month, Mr. Speaker. 

That’s what that gentleman was paid. Also when they were in 

government, Mr. Speaker, a name comes to mind — Murdoch 

Carriere receiving $275,000, Mr. Speaker, while women who 

were harassed by that gentleman received $15,000. That’s the 

kind of administration there is over there, Mr. Speaker. 

 

And I also want to add, Mr. Speaker, that today we learned that 

Jim Fodey has received over a $100,000 for . . . is it resignation 

with cause? Without cause? Is it termination? Is it dismissal? 

They’ve changed their minds so many times over there; they 

don’t even know why he’s been given $130,000. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, when the member wanders off 

talking about specific severance packages or contracts that are 

there to deal with certain issues, I can understand why he’s 

having difficulty dealing with a topic as important to 

Saskatchewan women as pay equity and equality. Mr. Speaker, 

all we have to do is look at the wages that are being paid. We 

don’t have to go median or mean. We can look at the 

percentage of women that are in the top echelons of Executive 

Council, and you can’t tell me there isn’t women in this 

province not capable of doing the jobs. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, a plain example: why is there women civil 

servants that were terminated without cause, having to take this 

government to court? It’s a pattern that’s being set, Mr. 

Speaker, and this government needs to answer for it. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

[14:15] 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, isn’t it ironic how times 

change? On Christmas Eve in 1991, that former government 

dismissed an individual, a single mother, on Christmas Eve, Mr. 

Speaker. Now she has the gall to stand in this Assembly and say 

we’ve somehow mistreated women that have been let go. 

 

Mr. Speaker, what we have done, and I’ve already indicated in 

this House, we have 27 fewer political staff, which is 15 per 

cent less than what the NDP had, Mr. Speaker. That’s factual. 

 

We will provide the information in terms of the salaries 

identified to ensure that they are able to compare, Mr. Speaker, 

equals to equals. They need to compare the NDP salaries that 

were in place last year, which would have received a 4 per cent 

wage increase this year. They need to take that into account, 

Mr. Speaker, when they compare those salaries to the salaries 

that we will provide them through the written information that 

has been asked for. 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — Members will come to order.
