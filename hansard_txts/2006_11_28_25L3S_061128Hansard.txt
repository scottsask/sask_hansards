Prince Albert Building Receives Certification 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday I attended a ceremony celebrating the Prince Albert 
forest centre as the first building in Saskatchewan and one of 
only four in the Prairie provinces to attain the gold level of 
LEED [leadership in energy and environmental design] 
certification. 
 
Mr. Speaker, LEED stands for leadership in energy and 
environmental design. It is a voluntary and international rating 
system evaluating projects based on points in six key areas: site 
sustainability, water efficiency, energy efficiency and 
atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental 
quality, and innovation in the design process. 
 
Mr. Speaker, buildings such as the Prince Albert forest centre 
use 50 per cent less energy than conventional buildings. The 
centre also uses 70 per cent natural lighting and 100 per cent 
fresh air. The air quality of LEED buildings is second to none. 
 
Mr. Speaker, our green strategy is based on the principle of 
combining environmental stewardship with sound economics. It 
is all about change, all about the development of a sustainable 
future for Saskatchewan. Green initiatives like the forest centre 
building demonstrate that economic and environmental benefits 
are not mutually exclusive. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite all members to join with me 
in congratulating all those involved with the forest centre in 
Prince Albert for achieving LEED gold certification. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker.

Weyburn and District United Way Communithon 
 
Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s my 
pleasure to rise in the Assembly today to recognize the 
Weyburn and District United Way on their 25th annual 
communithon which took place over the last weekend in 
October. With a goal of $120,025 over the 36-hour telethon, 
broadcast live on Access Communications, the Weyburn 
Legion Hall was the place to be. 
 
As with past communithons, the entertainment lineup was 
second to none, ranging from school groups, seasoned pros, 
up-and-coming stars, and those young at heart. Co-Chair of this 



November 28, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 595 

year’s communithon, Gary Erickson, commented that aside 
from reaching the goal on-air that his highlights from the 
weekend were the performances, notably the act by Jim Brown 
and John Ferrier, and the number performed from the musical, 
Oliver, performed by this year’s Lady Charity and Captain 
United. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to mark the 25th anniversary this year, the 
organizing committee made it a reunion, bringing back onstage 
— and for some back to Weyburn — some familiar faces from 
the past. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with about 30 minutes left in the broadcast, the 
goal of $120,025 was reached on-air. In all, including off-air 
donations, 123,000 was raised for the United Way’s 16 member 
agencies. 
 
Mr. Speaker, congratulations to the United Way board president 
April Sampson, communithon Co-Chairs Gary Erickson and 
Shelley Kievits, this year’s Lady Charity, Melissa Hoffman, and 
Captain United, Dalton Mainil, all the volunteers and the 
generous donors who made this year’s communithon such a 
tremendous success.

Customer Service from SaskTel 
 
Mr. Trew: — Mr. Speaker, isn’t it ironic that the Sask Party’s 
position on the ideological hard right pretty much always makes 
them wrong on issues? Take the Crowns for example. Their 
current leader’s incessant attacks on the Crowns leading up to 
the last election guaranteed them to finish second. While the 
members opposite don’t like or value the Crowns, 
Saskatchewan people do — and with good reason. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate SaskTel employees and dealers on 
another major achievement. For the second year in a row J.D. 
Power and Associates, a global market research firm, has 
ranked SaskTel number one in customer satisfaction for 
contract wireless services in Canada. In fact SaskTel actually 
improved its overall scores this year, placing first in call 
quality, first in service plan options, and first in customer 
service. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is just the latest recognition that SaskTel has 
earned as a result of its ongoing commitment to excellent 
service to Saskatchewan people. As competition in the 
communications industry intensifies, SaskTel will compete 
from strengths like their strong track record of innovation and 
customer service. Like Crowns or not, SaskTel employees and 
dealers continue to lead the way in providing excellent service 
to the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
These SaskTel service providers deserve our appreciation. Join 
me in showing it.

Saskatoon Students Participate in Business Competition 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
JDC West is the largest undergraduate business competition in 
Western Canada. The University of Saskatchewan will be 
represented by 45 of the finest College of Commerce students at 
the Vancouver event early in 2007. 
 
Designed to test business savvy and foster a strong connection 
for business students in Western Canada, JDC West 
incorporates nine academic competitions ranging from 
accounting to international business. The dynamic weekend of 
competitive excellence also includes a parliamentary-style 
debate, an intense handball tournament, and seven school spirit 
challenges. 
 
U of S [University of Saskatchewan] commerce students 
excelled at JDC West last year, winning the finance case 
challenge. This year’s group is eager to test their knowledge, 
experience, and expertise against business students from other 
Western colleges. All aspects of the competition will embody 
this year’s theme of ethics in business. And the winning team 
will take home the prestigious title, School of the Year. 
 
Financial sponsors unite to help our team attend the event and 
have the benefit of showcasing economic and job opportunities 
within their unique industries at JDC West. 
 
Saskatchewan’s young people, Mr. Speaker, are intelligent, 
resourceful, and hard-working. The competition broadens their 
learning outside the classroom and develops their analytical and 
communication skills in a real-world context. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I am confident that the U of S commerce team 
will be on the winner’s podium in 2007. I ask all my colleagues 
in this Assembly to join with me in wishing the students good 
luck at JDC West.

Corner Gas Hit on International Market 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Canada’s number 
one comedy has gone international. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — CTV [Canadian Television Network Ltd.] 
recently announced that the smash hit comedy series, Corner 
Gas, has secured a US [United States] distribution deal with the 
American cable network Superstation WGN. Superstation 
WGN is the national flagship of Chicago-based Tribune 
Broadcasting Company and is available coast to coast in the 
United States to nearly 70 million homes via cable and satellite. 
 
Mr. Speaker, CTV also announced that Corner Gas has now 
been licensed internationally to broadcasters serving 26 



596 Saskatchewan Hansard November 28, 2006 

countries across five continents. Soon Corner Gas will be 
available to viewers in countries like Australia, Iraq, Finland, 
Morocco, and many others around the world. 
 
Fortunately for the people of Saskatchewan and now across the 
globe, Regina’s sound stage has been available as a service to 
the television and film industries in this province. Brent Butt, 
creator and star of Corner Gas once said: 
 

It’s such a perfect facility . . . Having the sound stage in 
Regina made Corner Gas possible. [And I’m] not sure how 
we would have done it otherwise. 

 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to invite all members to join with me 
in congratulating all those involved with Corner Gas for such a 
great success. Thank you.

Karate Champion from Cudworth 

 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to 
recognize a constituent of mine, Jody Nidosky of Cudworth. 
Jody earned a bronze medal in the 26th annual Canadian karate 
championships held in Saskatoon in early October. Just 18 
years old, Jody competed in the men’s division of kata, one of 
the disciplines of karate. Jody holds a brown belt in karate and 
has been participating in karate since he was 13. He plans to 
continue training in St. Louis twice weekly under the 
accomplished instruction and leadership of Marcel Lussier. 
Jody is a grade 12 student at Cudworth School and the son of 
Michael and Jeannette Nidosky of Cudworth. Congratulations 
to Jodi on your remarkable achievement.

A View of History 
 

Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You know, the last 
time the Leader of the Opposition’s party was in power, they 
nearly ruined the province. As they are doing now, his party 
was clambering for an opportunity to take the Saskatchewan 
economy out for a ride and they finally got the chance. Well, 
Mr. Speaker, they took the province for a ride all right. They 
drove it recklessly and they drove it irresponsibly, Mr. Speaker, 
whooping it up until they finally drove it into the ditch. And 
then what did they do, Mr. Speaker? They walked away as if 
nothing had happened. I mean they weren’t unscathed, but they 
weren’t taking any responsibility either. 
 
Did they apologize to the people of Saskatchewan for almost 
bankrupting them and leaving them saddled with an enormous 
debt? No, they didn’t. Far from it. Instead of taking 
responsibility, they changed their name — not their philosophy 
or the way they do things, just their name. And now they’re 
demanding another chance. 
 

Mr. Speaker, the people of the province aren’t fooled. The 
members opposite could be sitting across there wearing fake 
noses and moustaches for all the good it’s doing them. The 
people of this province know who they really are, and they’re 
not about to give them another chance. Thank you.

ORAL QUESTIONS

Information Concerning Oyate Safe House 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, on November 16, I asked the Minister of Community 
Resources to provide me with any records of meetings he had 
with the Oyate Board on March 16 and May 1 of this year. 
Here’s what the minister’s response was, there was no meeting 
at all. 
 
This morning, the deputy minister told the Public Accounts 
there was a meeting, there was a record of that meeting, that the 
minister had instructed him not to release those records. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Mr. Speaker, since we now know there was 
a meeting where Oyate was discussed, what is this minister 
covering up? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Government House 
Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asked a 
question about procedure. As House Leader, I’m happy to 
answer it. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there is a long-standing tradition in this nation in 
the practice of parliamentary democracy. It will be not 
uncommon, Mr. Speaker, for ministers to meet privately with 
officials or with third parties. And quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, 
private meetings are just that. Private meetings are private. 
There is no jurisdiction in Canada, Mr. Speaker, to the best of 
my knowledge, that has any policy to release notes from private 
meetings that ministers have. 
 
Mr. Speaker, private meetings, notes from private meetings 
have not been provided. They are not provided. And they will 
not be provided, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
these two meetings were on a list provided of all meetings 
between the board and the DCRE [Department of Community 
Resources and Employment] officials and the minister. It 



November 28, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 597 

wasn’t listed as a private meeting. It was listed as a board 
meeting. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this minister has a pattern of providing incomplete 
information. First he says there was no meetings with the 
member of the board. Then we discover there was a meeting, 
but he’s not releasing the records. 
 
On March 15 of this year the minister stood in the rotunda and 
he said and I quote, “We have no evidence there has been any 
problems. We have no evidence they did not respond to the 
issues.” 
 
The minister has no credibility left. He can restore that 
credibility right now by standing and admitting he was wrong 
when he said there was no meeting. He can admit he was wrong 
when he said there were no records of that meeting. And he can 
apologize to this Assembly and the children who needed his 
valuable service and were betrayed. Will he do that, Mr. 
Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Community Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, when we first stood up in 
this Assembly to speak about this issue, I said the words that I 
welcome scrutiny, Mr. Speaker. And I will continue welcoming 
the scrutiny, Mr. Speaker, and to point out to that member and 
to that party that we will answer any question that he has or 
they might have, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And furthermore every official meeting that we had, and there 
is two big binders of information, all the records made of all the 
meetings that we had, the official meetings in which staff were 
there. They were certainly talking about the issues that Oyate 
was involved with, Mr. Speaker. We have forwarded all that 
information to Public Accounts, Mr. Speaker. We’ve been very 
open. 
 
Now what that member is suggesting is that as a minister that I 
certainly want to throw out the whole notion of confidentiality 
when I discuss issues with a wide variety of groups. As a 
minister he knows that I cannot do that, Mr. Speaker. The 
mantra of minister discussions with private groups, the basis of 
that, is confidentiality, and I as a minister will respect that, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Mr. Speaker, I know he can’t do that. 
Because if he did do it, it’d show what he’s covering up, and 
that’s why he won’t give us those documents. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Merriman: — On October 5 the Public Accounts 
Committee moved unanimously to call the former deputy 
minister, Ms. Young, as a witness. The next meeting of the 

Public Accounts, the government members conspired to assure 
that she would not directly question. And the Government 
House Leader who sits over there with such a smug look on his 
face suddenly lost the ability to say the word witness. 
 
Mr. Speaker, time and time again, the minister has refused to 
table documents, refused to answer question directly, and 
refused to come clean. Mr. Speaker, what’s going on over 
there? What’s this government trying to hide? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Government House 
Leader. 
 
Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, it has been said in this House by 
the minister a number of times — he just said it a moment ago 
— if you have questions, ask your questions. The questions will 
be answered. Mr. Speaker, there was a motion to ask the former 
deputy minister to be there. She was there. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we now have an hon. member saying that if the 
minister does not release notes from confidential meetings he’s 
covering something up. Mr. Speaker, notes from private 
meetings are private. That is a long-standing tradition of 
parliamentary democracy. It will be endured. 
 
And the real question here, Mr. Speaker, the real question here 
is the respect for the professional, non-partisan, public service 
and the conduct of the members of the opposition who are 
provoking professional public service employees to respond to 
policy questions and decisions. Those are the jurisdiction of the 
minister. Ask the questions; he’ll answer them. Allow the 
professional public services to reserve their position and . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. What that 
minister doesn’t understand, it’s not about parliamentary 
procedure. It’s not about ministerial privilege. It’s about the 
kids . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Why can’t we get the minutes to the 
meeting the minister claimed never happened? The former 
deputy minister was called as a witness but can’t say anything. 
Despite a motion from the committee calling her as a witness, 
the former deputy minister isn’t even told to show up for 
today’s Public Accounts meeting. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the people of Saskatchewan will want an answer 
on this, and we’re not going to give up until we get it. They 
want to know how could things go so bad. Why did it take so 
long to get to the bottom of this? What are they hiding? What 
are they covering up? Stop stomping on this parliamentary stuff 
and look after the kids. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Community Services. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. As 
the minister, when we certainly seen the problems attached to 
the Oyate Safe House, we took some very decisive action, Mr. 
Speaker. And I want to point out that as a minister, we said we 
take the responsibility very seriously and that we intend to do 
something to rectify the problem and to fix the problem, Mr. 
Speaker, and that’s exactly what we did. And it’s a bit strange, 
Mr. Speaker, coming from that . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order please. The 
Minister of Community Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
And they’re asking for answers which I’m prepared to give, but 
they keep yelling from their seats, Mr. Speaker. 
 
That member says it’s all about the children, and yet we’ve 
been up here how many weeks now, Mr. Speaker, and we’re 
prepared to stay here for the number of weeks as well. And not 
once has he touched on the solutions or the progress made on 
the recommendations that the all-party committee had, not 
once. What he’s been asking for, Mr. Speaker, is for 
information and alleging a cover-up. It’s never been about the 
children, Mr. Speaker. It’s always been about their political 
agenda, Mr. Speaker. We’ll continue being very open, Mr. 
Speaker.

Supply of Endocrinologists 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In May 2006 the 
last practising endocrinologist left Saskatoon. Dr. Tammy 
McNab sought work elsewhere because she didn’t want to be 
the only doctor responsible for thousands of patients. In other 
words, she was overwhelmed and overworked. She was also 
extremely frustrated by the recruitment process of this 
government; she said it moved at a snail’s pace. After she left, 
Saskatoon has no endocrinologist. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this month is Diabetes Awareness Month. It is 
now been six months. Can the Minister of Health tell this 
Assembly how many full-time endocrinologists are practising in 
Saskatoon? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 
simple answer with regards to the endocrinologist who left and 
for whom the position was being recruited, that position has 
been successfully recruited, Mr. Speaker, and the successful 
applicant will be in Saskatoon and practising early in the new 
year. 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — More than 50,000 people live with diabetes 
in Saskatchewan. There are nearly 3,000 new cases yearly. 
Type 2 diabetes is an epidemic amongst our First Nations 
community. Six years ago the Saskatchewan advisory 
committee on diabetes released a report that recommended that 
Saskatchewan need eight endocrinologists by 2004. At that 
time, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons also 
recommended one endocrinologist for 80,000 people. That 
would put 12 endocrinologists in our province if we followed 
their recommendations. Right now we have two. That’s one for 
every 480,000 people because endocrinologists he’s talking 
about won’t be here until the new year. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that begs the question. Does he feel the job is 
done? They’ve got one in Saskatoon, maybe sometime next 
year, two in Regina for a workload that we’re facing in 
Saskatchewan. That policy is falling far short. When are they 
going to deal with the real situation and recruit the number of 
endocrinologists we need in this province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 
member opposite knows that over the last couple of weeks I’ve 
had a number of meetings — two in fact — with the Diabetes 
Association, and in fact last week I attended a rollout of the 
Diabetes Association’s new mobile resource unit that’s 
travelling throughout Saskatchewan working on prevention 
aspects of the disease, Mr. Speaker, and Sask Health is very 
supportive of a number of these efforts. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan Health is also working very closely 
with the Saskatoon Health Region who is currently undertaking 
an entire inventory of all the specialists working within the 
Saskatoon Health Region. At the end of that inventory and that 
review, Mr. Speaker, we will have a good idea as to not only 
endocrinologists but other specialists serving the region and the 
people of Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I said before, 
the last endocrinologist left Saskatoon because she was 
overworked. She was expected to see thousands of patients. 
What will be different for the new one that’s coming in? 
 
The problem is we don’t have a core nucleus. What will happen 
is this new person will come in, and if they’re not supported 
with more endocrinologists, they will be overworked and burnt 
out and leave as well. Remember there are 50,000 people in 
Saskatchewan suffering from this disease, and two in Regina 
and perhaps one in Saskatoon will not cover the need. 
 



November 28, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 599 

Mr. Speaker, how long will it be before these doctors are burnt 
out because of shortages and decide to leave themselves? Since 
the minister has failed in recruiting more endocrinologists to 
meet the needs that we have in our province, what is he going to 
do to take the pressure off the few that we have here? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. We 
at Saskatchewan Health . . . And I say we, Mr. Speaker, because 
the recruitment and retention issues are more than just one 
individual, Mr. Speaker. They include all of those within the 
regional health authority who are diligently working on 
recruitment and retention issues and, Mr. Speaker, on delivering 
services to Saskatchewan people. But we take these 
responsibilities very seriously, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And I ask the member opposite to take his responsibility and 
explain how cutting the budgets at Sask Health — which is the 
policy that they’ve enunciated, Mr. Speaker — how that cutting 
the budget will assist in recruiting additional specialists to the 
regions across Canada. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Melfort. 
 

School Closures 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today we see a 
real example of how the NDP’s [New Democratic Party] 
population loss is affecting Saskatchewan families. Fewer 
students and fewer families means communities are forced to 
deal with the possibility of school closures. 
 
But in typical NDP fashion, instead of dealing with the 
problem, the NDP postponed the problem. Three years ago the 
NDP put a moratorium in place to stop school closures. But this 
January will mark the end to that moratorium. 
 
Mr. Speaker, will the minister tell this Assembly today how 
many schools she expects to close in the upcoming year when 
the moratorium is lifted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Learning. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, just for clarification in the House and for the 
members’ information, the moratorium was put on to stop 
school closures until the end of ’06 for the reason that the 
school divisions were going through some major changes, in 
fact the largest changes that this education system has seen in 
over 60 years. The amalgamations . . . while the boundaries are 
drawn and the new boards are in place, Mr. Speaker, there’s 
still a great deal of work being done by the school divisions, but 
the moratorium is lifted at the end of December this year. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — I’d like to thank the minister for explaining 
something everyone in this province already understands. The 
question was, how many schools are expected to close as a 
result of the lifting of the moratorium next year? 
 
And certainly people in this province are concerned. Here’s 
what the headlines in the media are saying: from the CBC 
[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation], “School closures eyed in 
Prince Albert area”; from the Leader-Post, “Future of several 
schools in south Saskatchewan in doubt”; from The 
StarPhoenix, “School closures loom in rural Saskatchewan.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, school divisions have real concerns over their 
future operations and are looking to this government for 
guidance, not simply postponing the problem. Mr. Speaker, can 
the minister tell us what specific provincial guidelines she plans 
to implement for advising school divisions on how to handle the 
difficult issue of school closures, and how many schools does 
she expect to be closed next year? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Learning. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, there are guidelines clearly 
defined in the legislation when it comes to the tough decisions 
that school divisions will make. Mr. Speaker, the members 
opposite are hollering, how many, how many. Many of the 
school divisions are currently going through a process of 
amalgamating programs from the various divisions that have 
come together into the larger amalgamated divisions. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we don’t have definite numbers. We don’t know 
what decisions the school boards will make. That will be 
decided over the next couple of months. But, Mr. Speaker, I 
would ask the members opposite, many of them across this 
province put in their MLA [Member of the Legislative 
Assembly] articles, and I will quote from the member from 
Melfort’s article from last year, “Teachers are being left behind 
as the NDP’s underfunding of education will result in at least 
150 teacher cuts.” 

 
Totally inaccurate. They were spreading rumours and 
fearmongering across the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member from 
Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
there’s a long-standing history of this NDP government of not 
consulting. Mr. Speaker, I fear this will continue with the 
looming school closures. And I’m not the only one who feels 
this way, Mr. Speaker. Here’s a quote . . . and I’m glad the 
minister brought up the issue of teachers because here’s a quote 
from the STF [Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation] bulletin . . . 
president in the November 22 issue of the Saskatchewan 
Bulletin. And I quote, “‘Teachers understand . . . these 
conversations need to occur, but I am very concerned at the lack 



600 Saskatchewan Hansard November 28, 2006 

of consultation with teachers in some of these divisions.’” 
 

Mr. Speaker, teachers are indeed frustrated. I’m hearing from 
parents and school agencies who are also frustrated. Mr. 
Speaker, can the minister explain what she plans to do to 
involve teachers, parents, and school agencies in the process? 
Can she guarantee these stakeholders that they will have input 
in these decisions before they’re made, not afterwards when it’s 
too late? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Learning. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, it was interesting in the 
quote that he read. It said there was a lack of consultation in the 
divisions. Well I would recommend to the STF that they speak 
to their boards, they speak to their members within the 
divisions, and address the issues that are there within the 
divisions because the divisions are the groups that are 
connected to the communities. They are well aware of the needs 
of their students and the communities within their divisions. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there is a shared responsibility in the education 
sector in this province. It has always been so. And these 
decisions will rest with what the boards feel is the best service 
for the people within their school divisions. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Cypress

Highway 32 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, the people of Leader and area, 
specifically pharmacist Gordon Stueck, deserve high marks for 
creativity when it comes to bringing attention to the sorry state 
of Highway 32. Earlier this spring, concerned citizens launched 
a website complete with photos of the myriad of potholes on the 
highway, and then they started selling bumper stickers with the 
slogan, I Survived Highway 32. They’ve even got a DVD 
[digital versatile disc] featuring the trip down Highway 32. And 
now, Mr. Speaker, the citizens of the area have bared a bit more 
than their souls in a calendar featuring residents with their 
favourite potholes. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why has the NDP government let this highway 
sink into such a state of disrepair that residents are posing nude 
to get the government’s attention? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Thank you very much. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the member for the question, and I 
want to recognize the innovation and the creativity of the 
people who live along Highway 32 in terms of bringing this 
issue before the public. 
 

But I want to tell you what is also clear. The naked ambition of 
members opposite to get to this side of the House means that 
they will promise a new road for every community in every 
corner of this province, knowing full well that the province 
can’t afford it. And we will do this over a staged period, Mr. 
Speaker. We’ve got more money into this Highways budget 
ever than in the history of this province, Mr. Speaker — $90 
million more than in 2001, another $55 million that we just put 
in since the budget was delivered — in order to prepare 
ourselves for an expanded construction season next year, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, virtually all of the communities 
along Highway 32 and other supporting groups have come 
together to initiate a lobby. As recently as last week, this 
minister said he had no plans to fix Highway 32, right here in 
estimates. Yet his own department has entered into a 
memorandum of understanding that it will work together with 
the communities to move the issue forward. They don’t know 
what to believe anymore, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Now Joe Ries, Mr. November in the calendar, seems to have 
devised a pretty good way of getting the attention of the 
Highways minister. In his photo, Mr. Ries is planting potatoes 
in the pothole. I guess he figures that if he can’t get money out 
of the minister to fix the highway, perhaps he can sell him a 
potato pipe dream. 
 
Mr. Speaker, which is it? Are there any plans to fix Highway 32 
or not? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, we’ve been working 
with RMs [rural municipality] and with the local communities 
for a considerable period of time to bring the groups together 
with the Department of Highways to determine how fast we can 
manage the traffic in that area. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that member will know that because of this 
government’s oil and gas regime, tax regime, there’s been an 
incredible amount of activity take place along Highway 32. 
You’ve got oil trucks. You’ve got water trucks. You’ve got 
service rigs. I mean it’s a very, very busy place. 
 
The member also knows it’s a stretch of thin membrane road 
that was never designed to handle that kind of traffic. But that 
member should also know, as his colleagues should also know, 
that we’ve got 6,400 kilometres of these thin membrane roads, 
and we have to do them in a staged way. We’re going to have to 
choose, and we to have to make some choices. 
 
But I say to members opposite, why don’t you be honest with 
your constituents and quit promising a quick fix to every 
highway in the . . .

The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 
[14:30] 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, every one of the communities 
along Highway 32 were asked to contribute to the new hospital 
being built in Swift Current. Yet here’s a problem. They have to 
drive down Highway 32, a highway that actually has more 
potholes than road surface. And that’s the kind of road they 
have to travel on to reach the hospital in Swift Current. Mr. 
Speaker, remember the bumper stickers I referred to before? 
Well those bumper stickers are being sold to raise money to 
repair the damage to the Leader and district ambulance which is 
commonly required to travel this dangerous highway. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Highway 32 is really an area of significant 
potential. Why has the government decided to ignore the bare 
essentials required in this area while siphoning millions of 
dollars in natural resource revenue to cover its spending? Can 
the minister tell us the naked truth? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Well, Mr. Speaker, allow me to 
give that member the bare facts. There has been a letter of 
understanding signed between rural municipalities, urban 
municipalities, and stakeholders along Highway 32. It is a letter 
of understanding that we had been working towards as a 
department for a considerable period of time. And I think now 
that we’ve got the stakeholders together we can determine 
where best to spend dollars in that area, where best to divert the 
heavy traffic to, and where best to spend money. It doesn’t 
make any sense to be rebuilding TMS [thin membrane surface] 
roads when you know the traffic is going to beat them to pieces 
in a short period of time. 
 
These members, though, are out offering paved surfaces from 
Highway 368 down to Highway 330 . . . 32 to Highway 8. 
There isn’t a road in this province that you guys represent that 
you haven’t . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Order please. I would remind 
the minister to make all of his remarks through the Chair please. 
Order please. The Chair recognizes the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s no wonder 
the people along 32 have no certainty about whether or not their 
highway will be repaired. This minister doesn’t even know 
what number the highway is out there, and yet he’s talking 
about why he can or cannot repair all the roads in the area. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this government constantly touts the fact that no 

one will be left behind. But the people who live along Highway 
32 already feel that they have been left behind. Mr. Speaker, 
highway32.ca features 28 pages of comments from people who 
have driven that highway. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as the minister has said, the area is home to the 
largest natural gas find in the province — the Shackleton gas 
field. The resource revenue coming out of the area is incredible. 
What kind of government would turn its back on this great 
potential and fail to maintain the very road that delivers that 
revenue to their coffers? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I think it’s maybe 
time that members of that side of the House quit promising 
every road to every community. And maybe it’s time they send 
their wish list over to the government; tell us which is your first 
priority. Is it 32 or 368? Tell us which it is. 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Order. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Once again I remind the member from Prince 
Albert Northcote, the Minister of Highways and Transportation, 
that his remarks ought to be channelled through the Chair. The 
minister has 15 seconds. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — You know, Mr. Speaker, I do 
believe it’s time that members come clean. They can’t have all 
of these roads paved in one year. But they can go out and 
promise them all, but they can’t deliver them. Why don’t they 
send a list, tell us what their priorities are? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to 
you and through you to all members of the Assembly, today in 
the east gallery, we have a group of 11 grade 12 students that 
are here from Rosthern Junior College. And they’ve travelled 
down to Regina today to come to the Legislative Assembly and 
see how it works. 
 
With them is teacher Brad Nichol and Jesse Wiebe, and they are 
here from Rosthern Junior College. They are part of the ALSO 
program which is alternate learning and service opportunities. 
They’re here in Regina for one week on an inner-city service 
and learning trip, working in north central area. And we want to 
welcome all of them to their Legislative Assembly. And I 
would ask all members to help me join in welcoming to them. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the Government House Leader on his 
feet? 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Would the Government House Leader please 
state his point of order. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, I refer you to Beauchesne’s 
parliamentary rules and procedures, rule no. 321. Mr. Speaker, 
it has been long-standing parliamentary tradition in this country 
that those who the rules refer to of high official station, which 
will include high-ranking public service employees, Mr. 
Speaker, are protected from attack by elected members. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it is a very important parliamentary . . . Mr. 
Speaker, it’s a very . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Members, I ask all members just to be calm, 
and we want to get through this in the proper way. The Chair 
recognizes the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, it is a very important 
parliamentary procedure that is essential in the delivery of good 
government in a parliamentary democracy that those who serve 
in public as public service employees are allowed to perform 
their jobs as professionals in a non-partisan way. 
 
For that reason, Mr. Speaker, it is in committee a long-standing 
expectation that members of the committee will not attack 
public service employees nor push them to speak to or respond 
to questions of policy, Mr. Speaker. Questions of policy are 
clearly directed to ministers who are responsible for that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, today in the Public Accounts Committee, there 
were a number of examples in my view, Mr. Speaker, where 
specific members of the opposition, perhaps including the Chair 
of the Public Accounts Committee, Mr. Speaker, pushed public 
service . . . at least one public service employee to respond in 
ways that are inappropriate for public service employees to do 
so. 
 

I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you would review the Hansard 
of the Public Accounts Committee today . . . [inaudible 
interjection] . . . It’s an interesting comment that comes from 
the opposition. I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you would 
review, Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you would review the 
Hansard of Public Accounts Committee today and bring a 
ruling to this House as to whether the conduct of the members 
of the opposition in their questions and comments directed to 
the deputy minister of the Department of Community Resources 
are in fact in order. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — On the point of order, the Chair recognizes 
the member for Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, the member opposite has made a 
fairly serious allegation against the opposition. The opposition 
takes strong exception with that allegation being made. Before 
the Speaker makes any form of ruling on it, it would be the 
position of the opposition that that member opposite would be 
very specific and precise about which words were asked by 
which individual of this side of the House so that we know 
specifically what the allegation was. 
 
The meeting that the member opposite is talking about is one 
that’s recorded; it’s subject to Hansard and is subject to the tape 
recording procedure. And we would want every opportunity to 
answer to and rebut the allegations that are made by the House 
Leader, and we would want that House Leader to come forward 
and specifically allege which member made which statement so 
we know what and where the issue is, if any. 
 
It is the position of this side of the House that we act always in 
the most proper and appropriate manner, and we have 
considerable issues with what comes from that side of the 
House. And we would want every opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to 
try and defend ourselves and to understand specifically what the 
. . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, order please. Order. Is the 
member complete? 
 
Mr. Morgan: — I have nothing further to add, other than that 
would be our full expectation is that before there is any ruling 
from the Chair, we know the specific allegations and have every 
opportunity to comment on it. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Members will come to order again please. I 
would like to thank both the Government House Leader and the 
Deputy House Leader in the opposition for their remarks with 
respect to this point of order. 
 
I wish to advise members that when matters that arise in 
committee, procedural difficulties of any sort arise in 
committee, they ought to be settled in the committee and not in 
the House. Alternatively they could be brought to the House by 
a motion of the committee or an order of the committee. I refer 
members to Beauchesne, 6th Edition article 822.

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 35 
 

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Thomson that Bill No. 35 — The 
Infrastructure Fund Act be now read a second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’m 
pleased to be able to make a few comments on the public record 
about Bill 35, An Act to establish the Saskatchewan 
Infrastructure Fund. 
 
Mr. Speaker, a number of my colleagues have already spoken to 
this Bill, have raised a number of concerns. I understand that 
some discussion of this particular Bill took place in committee 
with the minister responsible. And so therefore, Mr. Speaker, I 
only have a few brief comments that I would like to make at 
this time because I believe my colleagues have raised a number 
of pertinent issues as to how the funds . . . the mechanism that 
should be put in place to distribute the funds under this Bill. 
Also they’ve raised some concerns about a number of other 
issues. 
 
But one area, Mr. Speaker, that I would like to put forward is 
that I think this particular Bill and this infrastructure fund that is 
designed to aid our communities in the province with 
recreational and cultural facilities, I think this provides the 
government with an opportunity to incorporate some 
environmental standards within this program, Mr. Speaker. 
 
[14:45] 
 
And what I’m speaking specifically about is perhaps using the 
funds within this particular program to encourage our 
communities to incorporate energy efficient aspects. Whether 
it’s a new building or whether it’s an improvement to existing 
buildings, Mr. Speaker, we need to be proactive in this area and 
ensure that any improved facilities or new facilities incorporate 
the latest design features, and particularly with regards to 
energy efficiency because, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that 
we hear consistently from communities and particularly small 
communities, Mr. Speaker, is that they are having great 
difficulty looking after and meeting their energy needs of their 
facilities, Mr. Speaker. It is something that I believe all 
communities, whether they be small or large, Mr. Speaker, they 
have difficulty with the energy component of their operation of 
their facilities. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, so I think this particular program provides 
the government with an opportunity to move forward in that 
area, Mr. Speaker. And I speak with a bit of experience in this 
area. In the past I was part of my own home-community 
committee that worked on. And we ended up, through a great 
deal of work, we built a new recreational facility in our 
community. We looked into incorporating energy-saving 

measures in that project, Mr. Speaker. And what we found is 
that in order — at that time at least and I believe that’s still the 
case — in order to incorporate some of these energy-saving 
features in a building, quite often the capital costs are slightly 
higher at the time of construction. But the payback time will 
vary as energy prices increase. As the cost of heating and the 
cost of lighting the facilities increases, the payback period is 
quite a bit shorter, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So as I said, this is an opportunity whereby the government can 
incorporate some of these requirements as part of this program, 
Mr. Speaker, and also incorporate the safeguards against 
perceived favouritism in awarding of grants and that sort of 
thing, Mr. Speaker, that my colleagues have already outlined. 
 
I believe, Mr. Speaker, that most of the existing concerns and 
questions that we might have with this piece of legislation, Mr. 
Speaker, can be dealt with in committee. So at this time I would 
move that this Bill move to committee. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion moved by the Minister of Finance that Bill No. 35, The 
Infrastructure Fund Act be now read a second time. Is the 
Assembly ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. 
 
Deputy Clerk: — Second reading of this Bill. 
 
The Speaker: — To which committee shall this Bill be 
referred? The Chair recognizes the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
would move that Bill No. 35, The Infrastructure Fund Act be 
referred to the Standing Committee on the Economy. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of Finance 
that Bill No. 35 be referred to the Standing Committee on the 
Economy. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. This Bill stands 
referred to the Standing Committee on the Economy. The Chair 
recognizes the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, in order to accommodate the 
good work of the Standing Committee on Human Services as 
well as the Standing Committee on the Economy and the 
Standing Committee on Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Infrastructure, to permit them to meet later this day, I move that 
this House do now adjourn. 
 
The Speaker: — The Government House Leader has moved 
this House be now adjourned. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly 



604 Saskatchewan Hansard November 28, 2006 

to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. This House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. 
 
[The Assembly adjourned at 14:48.]
