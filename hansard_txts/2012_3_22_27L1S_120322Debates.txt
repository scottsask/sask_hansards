 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 703 

 March 22, 2012 

 

[The Assembly met at 10:00.] 

 

[Prayers] 

 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Hon. Mr. McMorris: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

To you and through you to the rest of the Assembly, I’d like to 

introduce about 20 individuals seated in your gallery. They 

make up the STARS [Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society] board 

as well as STARS executive. There are 20 and I’m not going to 

read them all because I started reading through some of the 

names and I thought I’d butcher them. So I thought I’ll just say, 

there they all are. 

 

But I will, I do want to identify one person of course who’s no 

stranger to this House. And I’ve just kind of been thinking 

about the introduction and what I would say to Rod Gantefoer 

today, the day after the budget. I’m sure he’s feeling a little 

different today than he did in ’08, ’09, and 2010 after delivering 

the budget, and excellent balanced budgets he did deliver. And 

that certainly has continued on with the last two budgets with 

our now Finance minister, excellent balanced budgets. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would like all members to welcome the STARS 

board and the executive to the Legislative Assembly. I will be 

meeting with them later on today as they’re in with meetings 

today and I believe tomorrow. I look forward to meeting with 

the many, many familiar faces and great friends. So we’re all 

looking forward to the launch of the STARS program here in 

Saskatchewan and the excellent work it will do and provide our 

citizens. So if all members could join me in welcoming them to 

the Legislative Assembly. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Massey 

Place. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to join with 

the minister in welcoming these individuals to the Assembly. 

We know that ambulance care in the province is very important, 

whatever form it may be, and I would welcome all the 

individuals from STARS here in the Assembly today. Thank 

you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Northeast. 

 

Mr. Doherty: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to join the 

Minister of Health and the Health critic in welcoming the 

STARS board, but in particular a couple of members of the 

STARS board, Mr. Speaker, who have had an impact on my 

life. 

 

I see Pat Youzwa sitting up there. Pat is no stranger to this 

Assembly or to the Government of Saskatchewan, having been 

a long-time senior civil servant in the Government of 

Saskatchewan. And then most recently, a couple of years ago, 

Mr. Speaker, was president and CEO [chief executive officer] 

of SaskPower, obviously the major electrical utility here in the 

province and one of the few female executives at that level 

across Canada, and did a great job, and was my boss at one 

time, Mr. Speaker. So welcome, Pat. 

 

And as well, Mr. Speaker, while I’m on my feet, Mr. Gantefoer 

who probably doesn’t know this, but had a profound impact on 

my life as well. When I was a young teenager, one of my first 

jobs ever was picking chickens at Rod Gantefoer’s farm. And I 

did it for three days in a row and, on the second day, Mr. 

Speaker, I came home and my mother said, how’s university 

looking to you now? And it helped shape my life. So welcome 

back, Rod. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Riversdale. 

 

Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and through 

you and to all members of this Legislative Assembly, I’m very 

pleased to introduce some people who have had not only a 

cultural impact on this province, but an incredible economic 

impact. Today here in the gallery we have Anand Ramayya 

with Karma Film — Anand, could you give us a little wave? 

Torin Stefanson with T3 Digital Productions; Ell McEachern, 

the director of finance and production for Angel Entertainment; 

Melanie Jackson who’s the producer of Dark Thunder 

Productions; Kelly Balon with Karma Film; Tim Tyler with 

Cheshire Smile Animation; and not least, Teresa Mead, who’s 

Anand’s partner and probably the big brains behind Karma Film 

I suspect, or the big support person anyway. And I’m sorry I 

don’t know their son’s name, but we’re very pleased to see you. 

As a mom of two kids myself, I’m always happy to see kids in 

this gallery. So with that, I ask all members to welcome these 

people to their Legislative Assembly. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 

through you, seated in your gallery, it’s my pleasure to 

introduce two people that are very important in my life. I have 

my little sister here today, Shauna Weninger. If you can give us 

a wave here today, Shawna. And we have Gavin here today. 

Can you give us a wave, Gavin? Gavin’s always proud to say at 

child care or at daycare, he tells all the kids that his Uncle Trent 

works at the park. So he’s proud. I’m glad that Gavin came to 

the park today to see the proceedings here today. 

 

And Shauna and her husband Grant both live in Regina. Shauna 

has built her career at SaskTel. She’s on mat leave right now. 

She has three beautiful boys, three nephews for Stephanie and I. 

We’re pretty lucky on that front. She juggles a busy household, 

and it’s nice to see her and Gavin here today. So I ask all 

members to join with me in welcoming two very special people 

in my life. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 

 

Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise 

today to present a petition calling for greater protection for 

late-night retail workers by passing Jimmy’s law. We know in 

the early morning hours of June 20th, 2011, Jimmy Ray Wiebe 



704 Saskatchewan Hansard March 22, 2012 

was shot two times and died from his injuries. He was working 

at a gas station in Yorkton, alone and unprotected from 

intruders. 

 

We know in British Columbia and other provinces, they’ve 

brought in several safety precautions through law, including a 

requirement that workers cannot be alone during late-night, 

early-morning hours. And if they are required to work, they 

must be protected by barriers, such as locked doors and 

protective glass. I’d like to read the prayer: 

 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully 

request that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan 

take the following action: cause the Government of 

Saskatchewan to immediately enact Bill 601, Jimmy’s 

law, to ensure greater safety for retail workers who work 

late-night hours. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the people signing this petition are from 

Esterhazy, Gerald, and Langenburg, and Melville. I do so 

present. Thank you very much. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise to 

present petitions on behalf of concerned residents from across 

Saskatchewan as it relates to the management and reporting of 

our provincial finances. The prayer reads as follows: 

 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 

honourable Legislative Assembly call on the Sask Party 

government to provide Saskatchewan people with a fair, 

true state of our finances by providing appropriate 

summary financial accounting and reporting that is in line 

with the rest of Canada in compliance with public sector 

accounting standards and following the independent 

Provincial Auditor’s recommendations; and also to begin 

to provide responsible, sustainable, and trustworthy 

financial management as deserved by Saskatchewan 

people, organizations, municipalities, institutions, 

taxpayers, and businesses. 

 

And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

These petitions today are signed by concerned residents of 

Saskatoon and North Battleford. I so submit. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Massey 

Place. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I stand today to 

present a petition concerning the proposed legislation of a 

seniors’ bill of rights, calling on Sask Party members to do the 

right thing and support the legislation: 

 

We, the undersigned residents of the province of 

Saskatchewan, wish to bring to your attention the 

following: that many Saskatchewan seniors live on fixed 

incomes and are victims of physical, emotional, and 

financial abuse; that Saskatchewan seniors have a right to 

social and economic security and a right to live free from 

poverty; that Saskatchewan seniors have a right to 

protection from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully 

request that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan 

enact a Saskatchewan seniors’ bill of rights which would 

provide Saskatchewan seniors with social and economic 

security, and protection from abuse, neglect, and 

exploitation. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I so present. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cumberland. 

 

Mr. Vermette: — Mr. Speaker, I rise to present a petition on 

behalf of trappers of Saskatchewan. The current regulations 

being enforced are creating challenges that are a concern for our 

traditional trappers. The prayer reads: 

 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 

honourable Legislative Assembly may be pleased to cause 

the government to recognize that the experience gained 

through practical experience be valued; and in so doing to 

cause the government to review the current legislation and 

regulations with respect to trapping regulations and 

firearms use in consultation with traditional resource 

users. 

 

As in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

It was signed by many trappers in northern Saskatchewan. I so 

present. 

 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Centre. 

 

United Nations World Water Day 

 

Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, today is United Nations World Water Day. Each year 

World Water Day highlights a specific aspect of fresh water. 

This year its theme is Water and Food Security. Food security 

was a focus of an event two weeks ago at the Saskatoon 

Farmers’ Market where local chapters of three international 

NGOs [non-governmental organization] hosted a celebration of 

the contributions women have made to food production around 

the world.  

 

But the connection between availability of water and food 

security is an important issue both globally and locally. It will 

be important, Mr. Speaker, to watch how the lower amount of 

snowfall we’ve received this year in Saskatchewan will affect 

farmers’ crops. But it’s also important to draw attention to the 

achievement of the UN [United Nations] millennium 

development goal of safe water for 88 per cent of the globe’s 

population. This is great news and should not be overlooked.  

 

But however we need only to look to our north in Prince Albert 

to see what it was like to live without safe drinking water. 

Prince Albert just recently finished six weeks of a boil-water 

advisory due to mechanical failures at the water treatment plant. 

We cannot take our water for granted. There is still a lot of 

work to be done in ensuring safe drinking water here in our 

home province, in our First Nations communities right across 



March 22, 2012 Saskatchewan Hansard 705 

Canada, and right across the world. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in recognizing the 

United Nations World Water Day as we all keep in mind the 

important role water plays in keeping us in this world alive and 

healthy. Thank you very much. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 

 

Revenue Sharing for Municipalities 

 

Mr. Phillips: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday the 

Minister of Finance rose in this House and delivered a budget 

that’s all about keeping the Saskatchewan advantage. It’s about 

keeping the budget balanced, keeping spending sustainable, 

keeping our economy growing, and keeping our election 

promises. 

 

Mr. Speaker, with this budget, we are working with 

municipalities to keep this province moving forward because 

vibrant communities are central to the Saskatchewan advantage. 

And, Mr. Speaker, the 2011 census shows that Saskatchewan is 

now the third fastest growing province in the country. In order 

to ensure that community programs and services can keep pace 

with this growth, our government has delivered on its promise 

of revenue sharing for municipalities. Altogether Saskatchewan 

RMs [rural municipality], cities, towns, and villages will 

receive a record amount of revenue sharing in the form of 

municipal revenue sharing. Yesterday the budget represents an 

87 per cent increase over the 2007-2008 budget, and when we 

take into account overall funding to the municipalities in this 

year’s budget, it’s a 15 per cent increase. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our government’s commitment to Saskatchewan’s 

communities can also be seen in additional funding for libraries, 

urban parks, and policing. Yesterday’s budget charts the course 

for keeping the Saskatchewan advantage. Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Elphinstone-Centre. 

 

Better Business Bureau of Saskatchewan Torch Awards  

 

Mr. McCall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Better Business 

Bureau of Saskatchewan’s eighth annual Torch Awards were 

held this past Wednesday evening here in Regina. The Better 

Business Bureau continues to recognize organizations that 

consistently conduct their business practices in an ethical 

fashion. The 2012 Torch Awards honoured companies of 

various sizes whose efforts have ensured that our marketplace 

remains fair and honourable. 

 

The Torch Awards also recognize not-for-profit organizations, 

and the winner for this category for 2012 was Regina’s own 

Circle Project. Mr. Speaker, I know first-hand the incredible 

work done by the Circle Project on behalf of Regina’s inner city 

children and families. And I want to congratulate and thank all 

the good folks of the Circle Project, the staff and volunteers, 

especially Executive Director Ann Perry; President Bob Cantin; 

board members like Keon Flamont, Councillor Fred Clipsham, 

Carol Lyman, and Brian Sklar; and last but certainly not least, 

elders and spiritual advisors Kokum Florence Isaac and Kokum 

Shirley Bonk. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I also want to congratulate and commend the other 

nominees in this category for the Torch Awards, which this year 

included the Salvation Army Prairie Division, the Canadian 

Home Builders’ Association, and Souls Harbour Rescue 

Mission. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I’ll finish where I started, the Circle helps children 

and families. They do tremendous work, and it’s great to see the 

Circle Project be recognized for it with this 2012 Torch Award 

from the Better Business Bureau. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

[10:15] 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Estevan. 

 

Generosity of Saskatchewan Donors and Volunteers  

 

Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’m 

pleased to rise today to recognize the people of Saskatchewan. 

Now we, the members of this House, may be slightly biased, 

but I truly believe that Saskatchewan is home to the most 

generous people and the nation’s most giving volunteers. 

 

You don’t need to look far to find examples that help back up 

my claim. Just last week $101,189 was raised by Estevan and 

surrounding area in support of the St. Joseph’s Hospital 

Foundation Radiothon for Life. Volunteers of all ages pitched 

in to help pull off this inaugural event. Patients, hospital staff, 

and physicians offered testimonials about the impact of the 

foundation. Access Communications provided free phone 

services and advertising to promote this worthy cause, and a 

businessman from Lampman matched donations up to $50,000 

prompting a huge volume of donations.  

 

Just this month Telemiracle 36 set records by raising almost $6 

million. Whether it is helping underprivileged children, taking 

care of the elderly, or organizing for our Grey Cup celebrations, 

our people do their part. Mr. Speaker, the average annual 

contribution from the Saskatchewan donor is $544. The 

volunteer rate in our province is 58.2 per cent, and the average 

amount of time donated per volunteer annually equals 143 

hours. 

 

I would like to extend my gratitude on behalf of this Assembly 

to all the men, women, and children who step up and contribute 

when the need is there. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Provincial Judo Championships 

 

Mr. Lawrence: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, on 

Saturday, March 17th, St. Patricks Day, I had the pleasure of 

attending as well as bringing greetings on behalf of our 

government to the 2012 Saskatchewan judo provincial 

championships. The event was held in the gymnasium at 15 

Wing Moose Jaw and attracted over 160 entries from 13 clubs 

across Saskatchewan. It was a great day full of hundreds of 

participants from the ages of nine to senior citizens, each who 

all worked extremely hard to reach this level of success. 



706 Saskatchewan Hansard March 22, 2012 

My congratulations to all the event organizers, and a big shout 

out to the Moose Jaw Koseikan Judo Club on collecting the 

most points, 185 points, in the Judo Saskatchewan team trophy 

competition. With my background in martial arts, I understand 

the dedication and perseverance it takes to reach this elite level. 

I wish all the athletes the best of luck in their next competition, 

the Edmonton international judo championships, a four-day 

competition which will be held in two weeks. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I ask all the members to join me in congratulating 

not only the dedicated athletes but also the hard-working event 

organizers on a great day of martial arts in good old-fashioned 

competition. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cut 

Knife-Turtleford. 

 

United Nations World Water Day 

 

Mr. Doke: — Mr. Speaker, today marks United Nations World 

Water Day. It is held every March 22nd to bring attention to the 

importance of fresh water and sustainable use for fresh water. 

With an ever-growing world population, it is important that 

sustainable, fresh water use be pursued by everybody in the 

world. 

 

Mr. Speaker, wise use of our water is essential to our health, our 

economy, and to Saskatchewan’s future growth. The 

Government of Saskatchewan continues to deliver the highly 

successful provincial toilet replacement rebate program. To date 

about 45,000 toilets have been replaced in Saskatchewan, 

saving over 2 billion litres of water and reducing CO2 emissions 

by about 7000 tonnes. 

 

Mr. Speaker, water conservation is just one essential water 

management tool used to ensure sustainable water supplies. The 

water availability study is another approach undertaken by the 

Government of Saskatchewan to help ensure sustainable water 

supplies and support the province’s growth. This multi-year 

water availability study will provide critical information related 

to the water supply and demand to not only support future 

growth but to adjust to changes in our water supplies due to 

climate variability. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Government of Saskatchewan has also made 

progress on the boreal watershed initiative. This plan gauges 

and ensures that the ecological integrity of our northern 

watershed is maintained. It is designed to ensure environmental 

protection of this precious region. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 

Park. 

 

Education Funding  

 

Mr. Marchuk: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 

yesterday our government tabled a strong, balanced budget, a 

budget that focused on education initiatives that will have a 

positive impact on students across this province. The 2012-13 

education budget focuses on providing fair, balanced funding 

for all Saskatchewan school divisions, improving student 

support available to new immigrant students, and increased 

capital spending throughout provincially funded schools. 

This budget was an opportunity for our government to launch 

the new education funding distribution model. The new funding 

model aims to ensure funding equity is experienced throughout 

the province’s 28 school divisions. This year’s education budget 

continues our government’s commitment to improving the 

student achievement of First Nations and Métis students, with 

$4.3 million committed to initiatives that support more 

equitable outcomes. 

 

Government’s overall funding to school divisions in 2012-13 

will be $1.74 billion, an increase of 5 per cent over last year. Of 

this increase, $59 million will go directly to school operating 

funding. With this budget, Saskatchewan learners can expect to 

see facility upgrades, new schools being built in the coming 

years with the province’s school system receiving $38.6 million 

to begin new school projects around the province, and an 

additional $50.1 million allocated for 15 major school capital 

projects. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our children are our future. The 2012-13 

education budget is yet another example of our government’s 

commitment to the present and future of this great province. 

Thank you. 

 

QUESTION PERIOD 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 

 

Provincial Budget 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, budgets are about 

priorities, and yesterday’s budget has the everyday families 

questioning where that government’s priorities lie. That 

government is choosing to spend millions of dollars on three 

more politicians instead of addressing the needs of 

Saskatchewan people. That government has chosen to increase 

prescription drug costs for seniors and for children, young 

families; eliminate the film industry; increase tuition fees; and 

leave many K to 12 classrooms with resources that are 

unfulfilled. 

 

Mr. Speaker, how can this minister expect everyday families to 

take less when the government is spending millions on more 

politicians? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you. Mr. Speaker, the record of 

this government over its first term is a very positive one. We 

have addressed many, many inadequacies that the NDP [New 

Democratic Party] left. We ensured that the seniors’ income 

plan was changed, something that hadn’t been changed for 16 

years, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the personal exemption for people in this province 

prior to 2008 was just under $9,000. Today that personal 

exemption is just under $15,000, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, that 

means every person in the province of Saskatchewan, including 

seniors, are now able to have an income of $6,000 that is not 

taxable — that was taxable under the NDP, Mr. Speaker. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, there are many changes that we have made to 

ensure that we recognize that this province needs to be there to 



March 22, 2012 Saskatchewan Hansard 707 

provide the services; we need to be there to ensure that we 

continue to grow, Mr. Speaker. And as a result of that, you see 

the investment in health care. You see the investment in 

education. You see the investments in infrastructure, Mr. 

Speaker, and all of that is within a balanced budget. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, leadership is about 

example. In yesterday’s budget the government continued its 

four-by-four plan, cutting 500 more public service delivery 

jobs, but not a single job — not a single job — was lost in the 

Premier’s Executive Council offices. It’s a time for prosperity 

for the Premier’s office and staff, but cuts to jobs and programs 

for everyday families. Mr. Speaker, why does this minister 

reject leadership by example? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 

want to first of all add to the very first preamble of that member 

who stood in this Assembly, stands here time after time and 

says the investment in three additional MLAs is millions. Mr. 

Speaker, that’s just absolutely not true. Look in the public 

accounts, Mr. Speaker — $240,000 per MLA. That’s what 

they’re worth; that’s what we’re worth as well, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, let’s have a look at what the NDP did versus 

what the Saskatchewan Party government is. Mr. Speaker, 

compared to the last year of the NDP, the Saskatchewan Party 

has 19 fewer staff in Executive Council, and this pays out, Mr. 

Speaker, $87,000 less per month, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, not a single job cut in the 

Premier’s Executive Council offices. What they did receive 

over the last years was 100 per cent increases in their pay, Mr. 

Speaker. That’s the Premier’s office. That’s not what 

Saskatchewan people are getting. 

 

This government is taking money out of the pockets of 

everyday families, and it’s advancing misplaced priorities such 

as advancing many more politicians at the costs and time of 

millions of dollars. They’re cutting funding in many school 

classrooms. They’re cutting 500 public service jobs, but not one 

in the Premier’s office. And they have absolutely nothing in this 

budget to close the Aboriginal education gap. Mr. Speaker, how 

can the minister stand and tell everyday families that he has his 

priorities right when he’s asking them to pay more and get less? 

It isn’t fair, and it just doesn’t make sense. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 

 

Hon. Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, our 

government has been very conscious of ensuring that we were 

delivering services in a more efficient and more economical 

way. Mr. Speaker, I want to add, I want to add that the travel 

for government members, Mr. Speaker, the travel is down $3.5 

million, Mr. Speaker — 3.5 from the NDP. Mr. Speaker, we 

know that there are other changes that we’re going to make, and 

we’re going to make sure that we’re moving forward. 

 

The member mentions priorities. Well I’ll tell you, Mr. Speaker, 

the school division that I live in, the Good Spirit School 

Division, receiving $3.7 million more, is pretty happy with this 

budget. They’re not making cuts, Mr. Speaker. They’re not 

making cuts. 

 

If the member wants to talk about priorities, let’s talk about an 

additional $16 million for the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency. 

Let’s talk about $4 million for colorectal screening 

province-wide, Mr. Speaker. Let’s talk about 50 more million 

dollars to ensure that the surgical wait-list initiative is 

implemented. Mr. Speaker, that’s progress. That’s providing 

services to the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 

 

Resources for Northern Firefighting 

 

Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

Yesterday’s budget made it clear that the Sask Party’s priorities 

are in more politicians rather than services for people. Nowhere 

is this more apparent than the dangerous cut to forest fire 

protection staff of northern Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Speaker, yesterday’s budget featured a $2.3 million 

decrease in forest fire operations. In every area, Mr. Speaker, 

it’s a drop. They are decreasing the number of staff. They are 

cutting the supplies to northern forest fire fighters to do their 

jobs, and they’re not updating the equipment to make sure it’s 

dependable and safe to work with. 

 

My question to the minister, Mr. Speaker: with an expected dry 

year up north, why is he leaving our people in the northern 

communities and the tourism and the forestry industry less 

protected? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Environment. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank 

the member for the question, Mr. Speaker. We believe that we 

can offer fire services in northern Saskatchewan in a much more 

cost-effective way, Mr. Speaker. Moving to the new four-man 

crews, four-people crews will be done over some time, Mr. 

Speaker, as we know that in these positions that we average 

between 20 and 40 per cent annual turnover in these positions. 

So we’ll be doing this in a way that ensures that people that are 

employed in these areas, when they come back for the fire 

season, those that are previous employees will be maintaining 

their positions, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 

 

Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, these staff in northern 

Saskatchewan have long stood proud in the fight to protect 

communities and the livelihoods of the forestry industry against 

forest fires. But this Sask Party government has cut the funding 

for the teams on the ground. They’re putting the safety of the 

communities at risk by decreasing response teams, Mr. Speaker. 

With fewer boots on the ground, there is one less person to help 

carry equipment and perform time-sensitive, critical tasks in the 

face of what could be a life, death situation. 

 

Again, Mr. Speaker, these forest fire fighters are proud. And 



708 Saskatchewan Hansard March 22, 2012 

they’re proud to say to the people of Saskatchewan, we’ve got 

your back. Mr. Speaker, why doesn’t the Sask Party have 

theirs? 

 

[10:30] 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Environment. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. 

Speaker. Mr. Speaker, as that member will know, as a former 

Environment minister . . . In fact, Mr. Speaker, of the nine 

members on that side, a full one-third of their caucus are former 

Environment ministers so they should know that we do have, to 

this point, we’ve had five-member crews in northern 

Saskatchewan. We also have four-member crews across this 

province in northern Saskatchewan. We also have, Mr. Speaker, 

three-member crews. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we believe that we can provide these fire services 

in an effective and efficient manner, Mr. Speaker, by making 

this change. In fact, Mr. Speaker, that member should know that 

we have float planes that deliver fire crews in northern 

Saskatchewan. Many of them only have capacity for four 

members, Mr. Speaker. In the event that we have to deliver 

crew, this means that we can interchange those crews at a much 

more effective way, Mr. Speaker. This is in line with what other 

provinces are doing. BC [British Columbia] in fact has 

three-member crews. Alberta has four-member crews, Mr. 

Speaker. This is what many provinces are doing. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 

 

Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, first of all they blame mother 

nature. Now it’s the aircraft in the North that’s the problem, Mr. 

Speaker. All the rhetoric spewed by this minister won’t change 

the facts. He is gutting the ministry’s wildlife management 

branch by millions. He’s leaving our communities and 

firefighters in jeopardy by risking their lives in unsafe working 

conditions and smaller response teams, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Mr. Speaker, to sum it up properly, he has failed to stand up for 

his staff and his department, Mr. Speaker, pure and simple. So 

my question again to the minister: why are three more 

politicians a higher priority than the safety and the protection of 

our firefighters and our forest communities, Mr. Speaker? 

Why? Why? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Environment. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, I don’t think I need to 

remind members of this House, but I will. Mr. Speaker, there 

have been two members of this House that have spoken in 

favour of adding more MLAs [Member of the Legislative 

Assembly] to this province before the next election. One was 

the Minister of Justice when he introduced the Bill and the other 

was that exact member on that side, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I can talk about what he said. Mr. Speaker, Mr. 

Speaker, he said: 

 

Because right now in the Assembly, we have a certain 

number of seats, and as the minister alluded to, as the 

population grows, do we need more seats, for more 

MLAs? And the obvious answer is yes . . .  

 

Mr. Speaker, he said that not more than two weeks ago. 

 

Mr. Speaker, in terms of the fire crews, as I said, we have 

between 20 and 40 per cent turnover. That’s how we’re going to 

move to these new positions, ensuring that people that have 

their jobs — unlike the member from Saskatoon Centre in 2004 

when 200 people in the Ministry of Environment alone lost 

their jobs under his colleague, Mr. Speaker. That included six 

northern fire bases that were eliminated. 

 

The Speaker: — I want to remind members to put their 

questions and responses through the Chair. I recognize the 

member for Saskatoon Riversdale. 

 

Support for Film Industry 

 

Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This week we’ve 

talked about SCN [Saskatchewan Communications Network] 

and the importance of investment in local production to the film 

and television industry. The loss of SCN just a short while ago 

has been referred to by Emmy award-winning producer Ron 

Goetz as losing an arm. 

 

Yesterday, to many people’s shock and disbelief, this 

government cut the Saskatchewan film employment tax credit, 

and with it cut the jugular of the industry. Not my words, Mr. 

Speaker, but those of film producer and Gemini winner Anand 

Ramayya. To the minister: can he stand and explain the 

rationale his government used to come to this ill-informed 

decision? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Tourism, Parks, 

Culture and Sport. 

 

Hon. Mr. Hutchinson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, yesterday we presented the people of Saskatchewan 

with a balanced budget. And we all know that that requires that 

difficult decisions be made. The film employment tax credit 

program was a difficult decision. It was certainly one of them. 

 

Since 1998, successive provincial governments, both NDP and 

Sask Party, have provided over $100 million to our film 

industry through the film employment tax credit program in 

hopes of growing the industry. Despite our best efforts and the 

best efforts of the people in the industry itself, it hasn’t turned 

out that way. Instead of growth, we are seeing decline. 

 

Film production is down over two-thirds in the last five years 

and 18 per cent last year alone. Through the film industry task 

force, industry members themselves advised that the only way 

to maintain the current level of film production is to provide 

even more public investment. While we respect the industry’s 

recommendation to make that extra investment, we don’t think 

it’s sustainable and made the difficult choice to discontinue the 

program. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Riversdale. 

 

Ms. Chartier: — Perhaps had the minister actually read his 

own task force report he’d realize they weren’t asking for more 



March 22, 2012 Saskatchewan Hansard 709 

money. They were asking for a better way to spend the money. 

They had low-cost and no-cost suggestions, Mr. Speaker. 

 

In yesterday’s speech, the Finance minister used the words 

economic impact when discussing incentives in his budget for 

other industries. With a decision of this magnitude, with 

economic impact for both an industry and a province, I would 

hope the minister and the government have done their 

homework, although it would appear this has not been the case. 

 

To the minister: could he please acquaint this House, and the 

people of our province, with the economic analysis that 

informed this decision? And could he please table those 

documents today? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Tourism, Parks, 

Culture and Sport. 

 

Hon. Mr. Hutchinson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last 

November 7th, the Saskatchewan Party government was given a 

strong mandate from the people of Saskatchewan based on our 

platform of continued fiscal prudence. As the Premier has 

stated, we don’t have to look far to see examples of what 

happens when governments don’t control their spending. 

 

The provincial government, successive provincial governments 

have provided $100 million to Saskatchewan’s film industry 

through the FETC [film employment tax credit] program since 

its inception in 1998, support which was obviously intended to 

help the industry grow and prosper. As we mentioned, Mr. 

Speaker, it hasn’t turned out that way. 

 

Many of the contributing factors are beyond the control of the 

industry and beyond the control of this government. Attracting 

investment capital is becoming more challenging given the 

global economic turndown. Our Canadian dollar has risen to par 

with the US [United States] dollar, completely wiping out the 

competitive advantage that we used to enjoy over American 

jurisdictions. And, Mr. Speaker, the Canadian film industry 

continues to concentrate its activities in Vancouver and 

Toronto, moving away from our province. Mr. Speaker, that’s 

the economic justification. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Riversdale. 

 

Ms. Chartier: — How about Manitoba, Mr. Speaker? After the 

economic collapse, Manitoba took the right course of action and 

invested in their film and television industry and are reaping the 

benefits, and are reaping the benefits. 

 

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, the decision to cut this tax credit has 

a heavy economic impact, but it also has a very human impact. 

There are several people in the gallery today who were so 

stunned by this decision that they felt they had no option but to 

come to the legislature today to let the government know this is 

a short-sighted decision that affects real families. One of them 

is Anand Ramayya of Karma Film. For the very little, the 

government investment in the tax credit, he and his company 

provided a huge return on investment, creating jobs and 

economic spinoff, not to mention pride and the chance to share 

Saskatchewan stories like Wapos Bay around the world. 

 

To the minister: what does he say to Mr. Ramayya and all the 

others who tell him the loss of the tax credit is the death of the 

industry here? 

 

The Speaker: — I want to remind the guests in the gallery, 

they are not to be participating in events on the floor, including 

applause. I recognize the Minister Responsible for Tourism, 

Parks, Culture and Sport. 

 

Hon. Mr. Hutchinson: — Mr. Speaker, we’re still supporting 

the sound stage facility. We’re still supporting the SaskFilm 

operations. We’re still supporting SaskCulture’s film programs. 

And we’re still supporting Saskatchewan Arts Board’s film 

programs as well. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we’re also supporting affordable housing, we’re 

supporting people with disabilities, and we’re supporting better 

health care in the province of Saskatchewan. And although the 

Leader of the Opposition doesn’t think it’s very important, 

apparently, we’re also supporting Saskatchewan’s farmers and 

communities. Finally, Mr. Speaker, we’re supporting a balanced 

budget with no, no deficit, and that maintains the Saskatchewan 

advantage of a strong economy and sustainable spending. 

Manitoba has chosen a different path, Mr. Speaker. Manitoba 

has tabled a deficit budget. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Riversdale. 

 

Ms. Chartier: — Mr. Speaker, is that minister telling Anand 

Ramayya and everybody else who works in the film industry 

that they don’t know what this industry needs and that he does? 

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the minister stated he was . . . Does he 

have any idea how the film industry works? I don’t believe so, 

Mr. Speaker, despite the fact he’s the Minister of Culture. 

 

Yesterday the minister stated he was concerned the tax credit 

cost $100 million since 1998. We heard that from him again 

today. What he failed to mention was the industry generated 

over six times that in production values in the same time. And 

that does not include spinoff activity. This industry is important, 

and it also generates other economic benefits. For example, Mr. 

Ramayya’s last project, Rufus, brought to Saskatoon, in just 22 

days, $150,000 in accommodations alone. 

 

In yesterday’s budget the government made it clear they can 

make room for three more politicians but they have no room for 

those wanting to build a career in cultural industries like film 

and television here in Saskatchewan. To the minister: could he 

please explain to Mr. Ramayya why the economic activity he 

generates is less valuable to the government than that of other 

industries? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Tourism, Parks, 

Culture and Sport. 

 

Hon. Mr. Hutchinson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 

Speaker, in 2010 the Government of Saskatchewan decided to 

work collaboratively with the film industry task force to find 

ways to stabilize the industry and increase its competitiveness. 

Despite their very best efforts, the industry was not able to 

come forward with a plan that doesn’t require significant 

additional public resources. We did fulfill other 



710 Saskatchewan Hansard March 22, 2012 

recommendations of the task force by dramatically reducing the 

time it takes to process FETC payments, and, Mr. Speaker, by 

increasing the funding for SaskFilm’s marketing budget by a 

full 27 per cent. 

 

We took cost-effective measures to support the industry. Other 

jurisdictions have responded by significantly increasing their 

film support. We decided to take a different path, Mr. Speaker, 

as I mentioned, money for affordable housing, money for 

supporting people with disabilities, and money for improving 

health care and for farmers and for municipalities — all those 

things within a sound budget, Mr. Speaker. Those were our 

priorities. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Massey 

Place. 

 

Status of College of Medicine 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We learned today that 

the Minister of Advanced Education was notified that the 

University of Saskatchewan’s College of Medicine may be 

placed on probation. It’s a very serious matter, Mr. Speaker, 

because it affects the international reputation of our province’s 

medical school. 

 

My question to the minister: when was he notified of this news 

and why did he choose to keep it a secret? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Advanced 

Education, Employment and Immigration. 

 

Hon. Mr. Norris: — Mr. Speaker, the issue at hand goes back 

about a decade where the members opposite know very, very 

well, they know very well that the College of Medicine was put 

on probation, Mr. Speaker, about a decade ago. 

 

Mr. Speaker, they also know that there were about 130 

conditions that had to be met, Mr. Speaker. And although they 

made the first announcement for the College of Medicine 

expansion on the Academic Health Sciences wing back in 2003, 

they didn’t do anything except a photo op which was in 2007, 

Mr. Speaker. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, let me quote from the president of the 

University of Saskatchewan, that says, dated August 17th, Mr. 

Speaker, when I ensured I was in touch with the president, with 

the provost, and with the dean, and that there have been weekly 

meetings held since, up until December when their plan for 

action was then tabled to my office, Mr. Speaker. Let me quote: 

 

Your government’s support [that is the government under 

the leadership of our Premier] for health sciences has been 

visionary. The Government of Saskatchewan has done its 

part with the largest and most numerous accreditation 

issues resolved. There remain a number of matters for the 

university to work on and you have my assurance that we 

will deal with these orders in short order. 

 

Mr. Speaker, that’s from last August. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Massey 

Place. 

Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, it’s not breaking news that the 

College of Medicine was placed on probation back in 2002. 

What the minister fails to mention, Mr. Speaker, what the 

minister fails to mention, Mr. Speaker, the final okay for the 

College of Medicine was given in 2006, Mr. Speaker. When 

members came in, the probation period had been lifted, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

This issue, Mr. Speaker, this decision is coming in under this 

minister’s watch. After speech after speech, Mr. Speaker, from 

this minister about what had been done, to have this situation 

occur now under his watch, that is the concern. It’s not about 

resources available. It’s about the mismanagement, it’s about 

the lack of oversight from that minister. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Advanced 

Education, Employment and Immigration. 

 

Hon. Mr. Norris: — Mr. Speaker, quite simply what it’s about 

is the members opposite, when they enjoyed 16 years of rule, 

Mr. Speaker, they starved that College of Medicine, Mr. 

Speaker. They starved it of resources, Mr. Speaker. Don’t take 

my word for it. Here’s the president of the University of 

Saskatchewan: “A decade ago our College of Medicine faced 

existential issues regarding resources, faculty, and facilities.” 

 

Mr. Speaker, there were 130 conditions that had to be met; 120 

have been met, Mr. Speaker. They know the root source of this. 

We have made sure the resources are available, Mr. Speaker. 

 

And as far as the claim from the member opposite — he’s just 

suggested that there has been some kind of mismanagement, 

Mr. Speaker — that’s a direct insult to the dean; it’s a direct 

insult to the provost; it’s a direct insult to the president. It’s a 

direct insult to the board and board Chair, Mr. Speaker. They 

have all been working diligent, Mr. Speaker. 

 

There are 10 more steps to take, Mr. Speaker. We’re making 

sure that those are going to take place while the other members 

are heaping mud, Mr. Speaker. 

 

[10:45] 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Massey 

Place. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, the concerns are being raised by 

the committee on accreditation of Canadian medical schools. 

That is who is raising the concerns. 

 

Mr. Speaker, this isn’t the first time that the minister has 

arrogantly dismissed problems that have occurred under his 

watch. This is not the first time. Every member of this 

Assembly and people of the Saskatchewan public know that 

through his oversight of the college merger mess, when 

concerns were raised he chose to ignore them and to sweep 

them under the rug. 

 

My question to the minister: when was he informed? When was 

this minister informed about the possible probation? Why did 

he keep it a secret? And will he admit that it is happening under 

his watch? 

 



March 22, 2012 Saskatchewan Hansard 711 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 

 

Hon. Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, this budget that 

we’re debating today in the legislature certainly is about dealing 

with current issues and future issues for the province. It’s also 

about dealing with past issues left over from the NDP. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition was a minister of 

Health during this era we’re talking about, and I think he owes 

the people of this province an answer to an important question. 

I was watching the CTV [Canadian Television Network] 

morning show this morning, and the reporter asked that member 

of this Assembly, they said, well if not the film tax credit, what 

would you cut? And do you know what that member said, the 

Leader of the Opposition said? Well we’d take a look at some 

of the initiatives around agriculture. We’d look at some of the 

things done for municipalities. 

 

Mr. Speaker, that’s the old NDP way, Mr. Speaker — drive a 

wedge in this province, ignore rural Saskatchewan, ignore 

municipalities. We make a choice to side with those sectors of 

the economy. We make a choice for a balanced budget and to 

keep this province moving forward, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 

order to facilitate the installation of the next Lieutenant 

Governor, I move that this House do now adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — Order. Would the Government House Leader 

be prepared to hold that motion in abeyance so we can deal with 

written questions? 

 

Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Yes, Mr. Speaker, we should deal with 

written questions prior to adjourning. 

 

ORDERS OF THE DAY 

 

WRITTEN QUESTIONS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government Whip. 

 

Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wish to table the 

answers to questions 185 through 224. 

 

The Speaker: — The Government Whip has tabled questions 

185 to 224. 

 

I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 

order to facilitate the installation of the next Lieutenant 

Governor of Saskatchewan, I move that this House do now 

adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — The Government House Leader has moved 

that this House do now adjourn. Is it the pleasure of the 

Assembly to adopt the question? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 

 

The Speaker: — Carried. This House now stands adjourned to 

1:30 Monday morning. 

 

[The Assembly adjourned at 10:49.]
