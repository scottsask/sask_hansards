highways have been constructed under a partnership 
agreement as outlined by the minister, and are the financial 
terms of these partnership agreements based on similar 
percentage of costs for construction and maintenance? 

And the second question: 
 

To the Minister of Highways: has the department 
determined if an additional amount will be allocated for 
fuel as part of the tenders let for highway construction this 
year? 

 
INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s a pleasure for me 
to introduce to you and through you to all of the House a group 
of seven grade twelve students sitting in the top row of your 
gallery, Mr. Speaker. 
 
These students are from the school in Eastend. They’re 
accompanied by teacher, Shelley Morvik, and bus driver, Curt 
Humphrey. I’ve introduced both the teacher and the bus driver 
previously and said a variety of things about them. We won’t go 
into that today but safe to say that Curt and I have coffee 
together frequently and we discuss a lot of the ongoings of this 
House over coffee. I’ve found him to be a pretty knowledgeable 
coffee partner. 
 
But the students today got a real lesson in what goes on in this 
place. We’ve already had a chance to talk together and visit and 
I think they’re quite interested in seeing what happens here this 
afternoon. So, Mr. Speaker, would you and the rest of my 
colleagues please welcome them to the House today. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Estevan. 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to you 
and through you to all members I would like to introduce Tyler 
Hoyt and his dad, Vern. They are seated in your gallery, Mr. 
Speaker, and they both live in the Regina Dewdney 
constituency. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, Tyler is the Saskatchewan provincial junior 
champion in 10-pin bowling for the Youth Bowling Council of 
Canada and he will be representing Saskatchewan at the 
national championships in Edmonton on April 16 and 17. And 
as well his sister Amanda will be representing Saskatchewan at 
the Saskatchewan bantam provincial championship at the same 
time in the national tournament in Edmonton. And Tyler is also 
the intermediate provincial champion for the Canadian 10-pin 
bowling federation and he will represent this province at the 
championships in Victoria, BC [British Columbia] on June 3 
and 4. So Vern is a very proud dad and rightly so. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in welcoming Tyler 
and his dad to the Assembly today. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 



April 7, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2403 

Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 
through you to the rest of the Assembly, I’d like to introduce 
two guests in your gallery, George and Theresa Siefert are here 
today to hopefully enjoy the proceedings and enjoy some of the 
results of the proceedings, Mr. Speaker. So I’d like all members 
to welcome them here today. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Chair: — The Chair recognizes the member for Saskatoon 
Silver Springs. 
 

Saskatoon Radio Royal Day of Caring Fundraiser 
 

Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today all six 
radio stations in Saskatoon are working together on a 12-hour 
fundraising blitz called Saskatoon Radio Royal Day of Caring. 
C95, CJWW, 650 CKOM, Magic 98, Rock 102, and Hot 93 
have been broadcasting from various locations across Saskatoon 
since 6 a.m. 
 
All proceeds received today will support renovations and 
upgrades to the Royal University Hospital. This is the first time 
in Canada that every private radio station in a city has come 
together to create a major radio fundraiser. The need for quality 
medical care unites us all. 
 
The Royal Day of Caring is part of the Royal Care campaign to 
enhance the basics provided by government funding in order to 
address today’s health care crisis. The campaign information 
asks, how long will we accept the longest waiting lists in the 
country? We have facilities that don’t always accommodate the 
newest medical technology. How long do we stand by and 
watch physicians and other medical professionals leave our 
beautiful province for greener pastures? How long before we 
stop asking why and start taking charge? How much would you 
give to spend less time in the waiting room? 
 
The Royal Care campaign is more than fixing facilities and 
getting equipment. It’s a campaign to care for people by 
investing now so that everyone can have timely access to 
leading health-care professionals today and into the future. 
Listeners can donate by calling 683-CARE, 683-2273. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask you and all of my colleagues in this 
Assembly to congratulate Saskatoon radio stations and Royal 
University Hospital on their fundraising efforts today. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Yorkton. 
 

Yorkton Terriers Head into Hockey League Finals 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 
Yorkton Terriers are ready and raring to go in the Saskatchewan 
Junior Hockey League finals, Mr. Speaker. Last night after a 
tough, seven-game series the Terriers came out on top of the 
Estevan Bruins winning the final match, Mr. Speaker, 4 to 3. 
And it was a hard-fought game and a hard-fought series, Mr. 

Speaker, but it seems like the Terriers were just a little bit better 
in keeping their sticks on the ice, Mr. Speaker. And the Bruins 
tried to muzzle those Terriers, but to no avail. 
 
Mr. Speaker, these great young hockey players have done 
exceptionally well in the whole tournament. And prior to 
putting the Bruins back into hibernation, the Terriers took out 
the Notre Dame Hounds in four straight games, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Terriers are strong in both offence and defence 
and are rested and ready to take on the North Battleford North 
Stars, Mr. Speaker, for the Credential Cup which is the 
symbolic cup for the junior hockey league. And, Mr. Speaker, 
this will be a great series. 
 
And I just want to say to the esteemed member from North 
Battleford, that while he’s my colleague on this side of the 
House, Mr. Speaker, when it comes to hockey, the gloves are 
off, Mr. Speaker. And you’re . . . and I’ve watched him. He’s 
been collaborating, Mr. Speaker, with the member from 
Estevan. It will do no good for him to collaborate with the 
member from Estevan, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The winner of the championship will be headed to the Manitoba 
hockey league championship for the Royal Cup. And I’ll be 
looking forward, Mr. Speaker, in the next two weeks to stand 
up again and give another member statement to say that the 
Yorkton Terriers are headed off to represent Saskatchewan in 
the finals, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Today I want to assist the member from Estevan and from 
North Battleford to join with me in wishing the Yorkton 
Terriers well in their winning of the Saskatchewan junior finals. 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 

North Saskatoon Business Association’s 
Business Builder Awards 

 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, last night I had the privilege of 
travelling to Saskatoon with the members from Saskatoon 
Silver Springs, Massey Place, and Fairview for the North 
Saskatoon Business Association Business Builder Awards. 
 
This was an exciting evening with over 400 people in 
attendance. It was a pleasure to see the excitement and 
enthusiasm from both the nominees and the winners. There are 
eight winners, so I’ll try and be as quick as possible with those, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
The award winner for the New Direction Award was Accutek 
Innovations. The Job Creation Award went to Wardrop 
Engineering. The Team Building Award went to the Quality 
Hotel, a fine hotel I might add, Mr. Speaker. The Management 
Quality Award went to Tap Communications. The Small 
Business Award went to Grower Direct. The Export Award 
went to Nu-Fab Burton. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, there was a Business Builder Award that was 



2404 Saskatchewan Hansard April 7, 2005 

a city-wide award that was elected by all of the members went 
to the Handy Group of Companies, which operates the 
Handyman Rental facilities through the city. And the Member 
of the Year Award was Louis Christ, a lawyer from 
MacPherson Leslie & Tyerman, who does their marketing. And 
I’m pleased to say that it was a lawyer that was actually 
winning this award. It speaks well not just of Mr. Christ, but of 
that profession in general. 
 
And speaking from my personal . . . I’m pleased to congratulate 
all nominees, winners, and in particular, Mr. Christ. Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[13:45] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Fairview. 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — Mr. Speaker, I too last night, along with the 
member from Southeast, and Silver Springs, and the Minister of 
Industry and Resources, and a large and enthusiastic audience 
of some 500 people attended the North Saskatoon Business 
Association’s 8th Annual Business Builder Award banquet. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan’s economy is on a roll, and 
Saskatoon’s along with it, and the members of the North 
Saskatoon Business Association are major contributors to the 
city’s and the province’s economic momentum. The Business 
Builder Awards are a celebration of business success and 
recognize the hard work and the commitment to excellence. All 
nominees are to be congratulated for their contributions to 
Saskatoon’s economic viability and sustainability. 
 
Mr. Speaker, here are the winners of the 2005 NSBA [North 
Saskatoon Business Association] Builder Awards. Job Creation 
Award went to Wardrop Engineering. Winner of the New 
Direction Award was Accutek Innovations. The Quality Hotel 
— the one I presented, Mr. Speaker — won the Team Building 
Award. The Management Quality Award went to Tap 
Communications. The Small Business Award winner was 
Grower Direct. Winner of the Export Award was Nu-Fab 
Burton LP. The Business Builder Award went to the Handy 
Group of Companies, and the Member of the Year, Mr. 
Speaker, was Louis Christ. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating the nominees and winners of the 2005 Business 
Builder Awards. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 

World Health Day 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, today is World Health Day. 
Every year we have the opportunity to celebrate April 7 as 
World Health Day to commemorate the organization’s creation 
in 1948. This year’s theme is Healthy Mothers and Children. 
It’s a theme which I know is of particular importance to the 

members of this Assembly and to the people of the province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, parents throughout Saskatchewan face many 
barriers in developing healthy lives for themselves and their 
children. We know only too well that food bank usage by 
families and children continue to rise in this province and that 
hunger continues to grow despite promises of government. We 
also know that many mothers and children throughout 
Saskatchewan are struggling to find the quality health care they 
need to live a healthy life. It’s a particular challenge for rural 
families who often find themselves far removed from health 
care services. 
 
First Nations families experience barriers to good health 
because of poverty, underemployment, and racism that affects 
their home life to the detriment of all society. Ensuring that 
mothers and children remain healthy requires us to think more 
than about physical health. It means providing children with 
stable, safe, and happy environments to grow, and enabling 
parents to find a balance between family and work. As 
legislators, it is our duty to ensure that all families enjoy happy 
and healthy lives. 
 
Today on World Health Day I encourage all members of this 
Assembly to take the opportunity to make a contribution in their 
professional and their personal lives to improving the health of 
mothers and children in Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Sutherland. 
 

Medallions Presented to Centenarians and Newborns 
 
Mr. Addley: — Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan’s centennial is, 
above all, a celebration of Saskatchewan people. The centennial 
theme, 100 years of heart, was chosen because it captures so 
simply and completely a defining characteristic of 
Saskatchewan people, a characteristic that goes a long way to 
explaining why this province’s history is a history of 
accomplishment and achievement, of challenges faced and 
challenges successfully met. 
 
Mr. Speaker, recently I had the opportunity to meet with a 
group of seven individuals who have done much in the service 
of Saskatchewan and who, being born either in or before the 
year 1905, got to witness through the course of their lives the 
development of this province into the social and economic 
leader that it is in Canada today. 
 
It was my great privilege to award Centenarian Medal to Tikla 
Larionak, Mary Hearonemus, Freda Mang, Anna Wilms, 
Phyllis E. Perkins, Myrtle L. Hopkins, and Sylvia Birnie. 
 
As well, Mr. Speaker, I had the honour of awarding Newborn 
Medallions to two children, Kalen Xhen-Zhi, and Mackenzie 
Mawson. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating these medallion recipients, both those who 
created Saskatchewan’s tradition of heart in the first place and 
in the first century, and those who will carry that tradition into 



April 7, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2405 

the next 100 years. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Thunder Creek. 
 

Bill Gomersall Celebrates 100th Birthday 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 2005 is 
not only the centennial year for the province, but is also the 
100th birth year for Bill Gomersall. 
 
Bill moved to Moose Jaw with his family in 1913 and spent his 
formative years in the city. Bill’s dad was a teamster and very 
expert with horses. Bill inherited his dad’s skills in that regard 
and was not only a well-known and expert horseman, but one 
who had a genuine understanding of horses. 
 
Bill gained fame all over southern Saskatchewan and northern 
Montana as a coyote hunter. So proficient was Bill in hunting 
coyotes during the long, cold winters that he built one of the 
most beautiful ranches in southern Saskatchewan, largely from 
the proceeds of selling coyote hides. 
 
In 2002, at the young age of 97, Bill started another career, once 
again travelling his old stomping grounds and renewing old 
acquaintances. Bill retells the cowboy poetry that he learned as 
a child. Bill still lives on the ranch in the Galilee district south 
of Moose Jaw that he loves so much and is a well-respected 
elder statesman in the ranching and horse industries. 
 
In this day and age when compliance with the norm seems to be 
the goal that so many younger people strive for, we should 
especially appreciate his rugged individuality and 
irreproachable integrity. Bill celebrated his 100th birthday 
March 20. Thanks, Bill, and God bless you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Treatment of Macular Degeneration 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
George Siefert is having a run of bad luck. In simple terms, the 
blood vessels in his eyes are starting to leak. Unless he gets 
treatment, he’ll go blind. 
 
Here’s another piece of bad luck. It’s not that the treatment isn’t 
available and it’s not that the doctor hasn’t ordered that 
treatment. The bad luck is that Sask Health doesn’t cover the 
treatment for this particular disease that Mr. Siefert suffers 
from. 
 
To the minister: why does Sask Health not cover the treatment 
that George Siefert needs to maintain his vision? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 

Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have sympathy 
for Mr. Siefert and for many others in the province who have 
problems with their eyes. 
 
Coverage for Visudyne, which is what the member is talking 
about, is available throughout the health regions of the province 
for treatment of age-related macular degeneration and for the 
treatment of pathological myopia in patients with 
predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization or 
CNV. This is provided at no cost to the patient. 
 
Currently, there is no coverage for the minimally classic or 
occcult forms of age-related macular degeneration which may 
be what we’re talking about here. No detailed clinical studies 
have been submitted to the review committees to support of 
Visudyne in these indications. Although there is some support 
from specialists for expanded coverage, it has not been 
approved by Health Canada or the Food and Drug 
Administration in the United States. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the minister is right. 
This particular disease that Mr. Siefert is suffering from is not 
covered by Sask Health. He has brought some bills today to 
show the expense of this, that he’s received from the Regina 
Qu’Appelle Health District. 
 
But it’s not that it isn’t covered in other provinces. The 
provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Ontario, and New 
Brunswick cover this very treatment, Mr. Speaker. If Mr. 
Siefert was a veteran, the federal government would cover this 
treatment. But not here, in Saskatchewan. 
 
Why not in Saskatchewan, when so many other provinces and 
the federal government would cover this treatment if they were 
under their . . . if Mr. Siefert was under their jurisdiction? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, my information as of last 
week is that Manitoba and British Columbia have some 
coverage for this, but that’s it for Canada. Mr. Speaker, when 
there are new treatments that come forward, we encourage the 
specialists who are involved to get the information, evidence, to 
the appropriate committees to make sure that we have these 
approvals in place. And this is what’s happening across the 
country. People are saying, give us the evidence around this. 
And, Mr. Speaker, we have to be very careful because there are 
many suggestions made around how some things will work. But 
unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we do not have the evidence yet in 
this particular case. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, every ophthalmologist in 
Saskatoon says this treatment would help Mr. Siefert. Those 



2406 Saskatchewan Hansard April 7, 2005 

ophthalmologists have written the minister and told him that it 
would benefit Mr. Siefert and many others suffering from this 
unique problem. This standard treatment is accepted in Europe 
and in the United States. It seems like the only people that do 
not accept this form of treatment are people in the Department 
of Health here in Saskatchewan. There is lots of evidence to say 
that this treatment would help these people. 
 
Why, because you live in Saskatchewan, do you have a second 
class, a poor class of medicine and of treatment, when it does 
work in other provinces? What’s the difference with 
Saskatchewan? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, in Saskatchewan we are 
very careful to make sure that we get the appropriate evidence. I 
have received and been involved in correspondence with the 
doctors that the member opposite has talked about. And I’ve 
recently written to them to say that if they have more evidence, 
bring it forward so that we can get it in the review process for 
our specialists here and across the country. 
 
Health Canada has not yet approved this particular substance, 
Visudyne, for the minimally classical or the occult forms of 
macular degeneration. And as I repeat, no detailed clinical 
studies have been submitted to the Saskatchewan review 
committees to support the use of Visudyne in these indications. 
I’ve written to these doctors last year; I’ve written to them again 
just recently saying, bring the evidence forward so we can deal 
with this. And we’re still waiting. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, ministers from other 
provinces have obviously got that evidence, because they cover 
this type of therapy. Ophthalmologists in this province are 
prescribing it on a regular basis for people who suffer from 
occult macular degeneration. Mr. Speaker, the evidence is in. 
The only people that aren’t believing it is Sask Health. 
 
This treatment is very, very expensive. Mr. Siefert has brought 
two bills from the Regina Qu’Appelle Health District. The 
treatment runs to about $2,300 a treatment. Some people will 
need as many as 5 to 10 treatments to reduce the progress of 
this disease. If it’s acceptable in other provinces and acceptable 
in other countries — because the evidence is in — how come 
we are once again lagging behind many, many parts of Canada? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, quite often in this legislature 
we hear the members opposite look to the west to Alberta. This 
is not included in the Alberta plan. They’re waiting for the same 
information. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 

Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible disease — I 
think we’ll all agree with that — but quick action is the key. 
You don’t reverse the disease. You stop it from progressing, so 
time is of the essence. Families are unable to quite often afford 
this medication. It’s virtually impossible for them to save up 
and be able to pay for the treatment because by that time the 
disease has progressed far too far, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Will the minister revisit this, change his policy, so people like 
Mr. Siefert don’t have to see a treatment sitting there in front of 
them but can’t access it? That is unacceptable in this province. 
Will he change his policy? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, we in this province are very 
careful around what kinds of procedures are approved in our 
plan. We look for the evidence. We encourage the doctors 
involved here in Saskatchewan to provide us the evidence. 
We’ve written to them a number of times for that evidence. We 
are awaiting Health Canada’s approval of this. We’re 
continuing to await that, wait upon that. Mr. Speaker, we want 
to have effective treatments for people, not ones that will not 
provide the relief that the people need. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 

Timing of Memorandum of Agreement 
Regarding Health Care Workers 

 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the 
deal the NDP [New Democratic Party] rammed through with 
health care unions just days before the 2003 election resulted in 
a 13.3 per cent increase in salaries over a number of years. I 
find it interesting that just days before the election the NDP was 
able to find significant resources for this deal. 
 
What I also find interesting is what we heard from this NDP 
government in the days following the election. On November 
22, 2003 the Premier told the Leader-Post that, and I quote: 
 

“Inevitably, there will be more demand on the treasury 
than the treasury can accomplish.” 

 
[14:00] 
 
On November 29, 2003 the Finance minister told the 
Leader-Post that, “spending is outpacing revenues.” If the 
province was so broke — in fact spending more than it was 
taking in — where did the NDP find extra resources to bring to 
the negotiating table? Was it negotiating with taxpayers’ dollars 
it didn’t actually have? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, once again the member 
opposite shows that he doesn’t understand how government 
budgeting works and how government contracts work. 
Basically what we do when we go forward and prepare budgets, 
we take information around what contracts are going to be and 



April 7, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2407 

try to put that into our two-, three-, four-year plan. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, what we do at the bargaining table is we give 
our people who are working on the mandate — in this case it 
was SAHO [Saskatchewan Association of Health 
Organizations] — certain amounts of resources to work with. 
The union comes forward with certain responses. That’s a long 
process and it continues. And in that . . . That’s the way we deal 
with all of the contracts that we have. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, in this particular case they were apart after 
much . . . a lengthy discussion, and further resources were made 
available. And it wasn’t a huge amount of money but it was 
enough to get a deal. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, let’s look at a couple of the 
facts. The Minister of Health says that they needed extra money 
at the table. There are suggestions that the deal will have cost 
Saskatchewan taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. This is 
at the same time when the Finance minister produces a 
2002-2003 document that says we are $225 million in deficit 
position, Mr. Speaker. 
 
On January 14, 2004 the Finance minister said, “You never like 
to raise taxes . . . our expenditures are exceeding their revenue 
. . . ” April 1, 2004 the Finance minister in the Leader-Post, and 
I quote, “When faced with the choice of a deficit budget or 
cutting programs, there are no easy answers.” 
 
I’m sure the members opposite will remember the financial 
situation of this province was so dire that the NDP decreed a 0, 
1, and 1 wage mandate for all public sector unions. Again, how 
could the NDP negotiate a 13.3 per cent increase on the eve of 
an election if the cupboards were not only bare, but in a deficit 
situation? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — This particular contract also included the 
government policy around putting pay equity into the 
agreements, and that decision was made in 1999 before the 
previous election. And the parties were working on 
implementing it and there are still aspects of that that we’re 
implementing now. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what we end up having to do is making sure that 
the parties bargain around the various issues and that they 
resolve those issues at the table. If our people who are 
bargaining need more resources, we obtain those. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, the amounts of money involved are not in 
the hundreds of millions as that member talks about. As it 
relates to this particular contract, it’s in the millions of dollars 
— maybe 3 or $4 million, I don’t have the exact figure — and, 
Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about what’s really happening. 
 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, the various health authorities 
have said that the implementation of the joint job evaluation 
will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. So how can the 
member stand in this Assembly and say it will be 3 to $4 
million, when in fact the health authorities are saying that this 
will be extremely expensive? 
 
Mr. Speaker, on the eve of the election someone had to know, 
on that side of the House, that there was an offer on the table 
that included millions and millions and millions of dollars. The 
only person who could have known that is the Premier. He 
knew when he was going to call the election. 
 
Mr. Speaker, after the election, the NDP said sorry, the 
cupboards are bare and 0, 1, and 1 is what the rest of you is 
going to get. How can this government continue to uphold its 0, 
1, and 1 mandate when firstly, it settled a substantial deal with 
other public sector unions the day before . . . days before the 
last election; and secondly, it had $1.2 billion in extra revenue 
last year? How is that fair? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I’ll respond to this question because I 
think, I think, it’s related to the health issue. But he is asking — 
if I understand him correctly — one question about a specific 
contract in October 2003 which was resolved over the next 
number of months, and then he’s asking about the overall cost 
of pay equity. 
 
Now I ask that member, are you in favour of pay . . . are you as 
a member opposite in favour of pay equity? Are the members as 
a group opposite in favour of pay equity? Because that was the 
policy decision we made in 1999, and yes, that does have some 
large costs. But, Mr. Speaker, we think those are important 
costs to make sure that the whole employment field in 
Saskatchewan as it relates to the public sector is fair. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 

Support for the Oil and Gas Industry 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, a 
couple of weeks before the budget came down, the Premier 
spoke about the future of energy at the Regina business leaders 
dinner. 
 
The Premier said that oil is a resource that offers this province 
vast, untapped potential. He said that the time has come for a 
major withdrawal. He also talked about how often we see our 
young people drawn out of the province to oil wells and head 
offices of Alberta. The Premier said it is time to bring the oil 
fields to our young people. 



2408 Saskatchewan Hansard April 7, 2005 

Mr. Speaker, that is great; that is, if the Premier actually meant 
it. But that doesn’t seem to be the case here because, on budget 
day, the NDP added a tax to the oil and gas industry. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the Premier: how will this tax help bring the oil 
fields to our young people? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, I note in today’s StarPhoenix 
— and actually it’s in the Leader-Post as well — Mr. John 
Styles, president of Wedona Energy, a Regina-based junior oil 
company, had this to say. He said, Mr. Speaker, firstly, that 
“Saskatchewan has seen a 100 per cent increase in oil 
production.” 

 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — He goes on to say, Mr. Speaker, that while 
production in Saskatchewan of crude oil has risen from 200,000 
barrels a day to 420,000 barrels, production of crude oil in 
Alberta, during the same period, has declined from 900,000 
barrels of oil to 600,000 barrels. 
 
And he then says, Mr. Speaker: 
 

Saskatchewan put a nice fiscal regime in for horizontal 
drilling and . . . (the industry) responded. 

 
And, Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that oil production is 
increasing in Saskatchewan and for that member to suggest 
otherwise is ridiculous. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Mr. Speaker, if it is ridiculous, then why did 
the Minister of Industry and Resources forecast in the budget 
that we are going to have a decline in the production of oil and 
gas in the province in the next year? 
 
Mr. Speaker, days before the budget, the Premier made an 
announcement at the University of Regina about new incentives 
for the oil and gas industry. In his news release, he said that we 
are going to wake a sleeping giant. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, after 
60 years, the NDP finally realize there is a sleeping giant in 
Saskatchewan. And, Mr. Speaker, no one was more surprised at 
the Premier’s words than the industry themselves. 
 
But just five days later, the NDP in the budget brought in a tax 
increase to the oil and gas industry, the same industry that is 
responsible for $1.4 billion in extra revenue in last year’s 
budget in the province. Mr. Speaker, every time the NDP just 
about gets it right, they revert to their old ways. 
 
Mr. Speaker, can the Premier explain why he would make an 
announcement about incentives one day and then just five days 
later increase taxes to the oil and gas industry? 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well of course, Mr. Speaker, what the 
member is saying is completely inaccurate. And as I explained 
to the House last week, Mr. Speaker, in response to an equally 
nonsensical question, the story of oil in Saskatchewan is not 
simply about more drilling, Mr. Speaker, it’s about technology. 
And as Mr. Styles says in the newspaper today, “The 
Saskatchewan oil and gas industry is a story about technology.” 
 
Because, Mr. Speaker, we can only get 15 per cent of our oil 
out of the ground. What we’re doing through the Petroleum 
Technology Research Institute and our royalties, Mr. Speaker, 
is increasing enhanced oil recovery and increasing production 
which has doubled, Mr. Speaker, contrary to the inaccurate 
portrait of what is happening that is painted by the member over 
there, Mr. Speaker. Totally ridiculous. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — . . . hiked taxes, the oil and gas sector. And the 
NDP doesn’t call it a tax hike though; they call it a way to 
address a revenue leakage problem. 
 
Each year, Mr. Speaker, this tax will take in at least $20 
million. It’s no wonder the oil and gas industry has no 
confidence in this government. The NDP says one thing to the 
industry and then slips something completely different into the 
budget. The Premier’s actions do not match his words. 
 
Mr. Speaker, how does this government expect to increase 
investment and expansion in the oil and gas sector when the 
NDP shows a total lack of understanding of the importance of 
the oil and gas industry to this province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, if the member over 
there doesn’t know, the change with respect to trusts has to do 
with providing a tax break to trust unit holders that live outside 
this province, and making trusts competitive with oil companies 
that operate and pay taxes inside Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
And it may be that the Conservatives, in true Conservative 
fashion, Mr. Speaker, want to reward trust holders outside 
Saskatchewan. That is not the position of this government. 
 
But I want to repeat, Mr. Speaker, that the Government of 
Saskatchewan is doing a good job building the oil patch. And 
the oil industry agrees, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And I’d like to refer the House to a letter that was received from 
a Mr. John McClement, who’s a geologist, and sent to the 
Leader of the Opposition last year. And I have his permission to 
use it. 



April 7, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2409 

He said, referring to the Leader of the Opposition and one of his 
colleagues, he says, “I’m surprised that you two have not been 
exposed to the geology of the west . . . ” Because he says . . . 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. I recognize 
the member for Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, again in the 
Premier’s business dinner speech, he quoted Todd Hirsch, who 
is the chief economist with Canada West Foundation, and who 
also spoke at the Centennial Summit. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, the Premier applauded Mr. Hirsch for his 
views. And I’d like to quote some of the things that Mr. Hirsch 
said when he spoke at the summit. He said, “We, in our time 
and generation, have no right to think small.” 
 
Mr. Hirsch continued on to say that we need to level the playing 
field, not by slapping on a tax hike. Here’s a better solution to 
levelling the playing field — get rid of the corporate capital tax 
altogether. 
 
Mr. Hirsch says: 
 

It’s ironic that the main industry responsible for 
Saskatchewan’s have status is the one targeted by a tax 
hike. 

 
He also said, Mr. Speaker: 
 

Not only that the government is wasting its efforts with 
measures that take it nowhere, it’s shooting the proverbial 
goose that lays the golden egg. 

 
Mr. Speaker, to the Premier: will you take Mr. Hirsch 
seriously? Will you cancel this tax? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I just remind the member to address her 
remarks through the Chair. The Chair recognizes the Minister 
of Industry and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m not 
surprised that the member would be advocating the elimination 
of the corporate capital tax because I think the Finance critic 
from the Saskatchewan Party has advocated the elimination of 
every tax. 
 
But it doesn’t really matter what we have to say over here 
because it doesn’t matter what the facts are, the fact that oil 
production has doubled — it’s not good enough for the member 
from Weyburn who wants to cut taxes for unit holders outside 
the province. 
 
But I’ll just quote what John McClement, a geologist, says in 
his letter to the Leader of the Opposition, where he says: 
 

I would agree with headline that, “Oil and gas [is] 
humming” and probably near the peak of its potential. 
 

Mr. Speaker, we are on a roll. We’re on a roll whether the 
opposition Conservatives recognize it or not. And, Mr. Speaker, 
we’re going to keep right on rolling right over the opposition. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. Oh pardon me, Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — . . . the NDP to hike taxes for the oil and gas 
industry has just served as a reminder to the industry as to why 
they cannot trust this government. It’s a reminder why there is 
no confidence and why we are not experiencing an oil boom 
when we have $55-a-barrel oil. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Premier talks about waking a sleeping giant, 
but has no idea how to make it happen. Mr. Speaker, will the 
Premier live up to his words and commitments of making 
Saskatchewan the energy heart of the future and will he cancel 
this tax? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[14:15] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite 
doesn’t know that the province is experiencing an oil boom, 
then I would suggest that the member opposite should visit her 
constituency more often. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — If she doesn’t know that oil and gas 
production has doubled in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker, and that 
there is, for example, enhanced oil recovery going on in 
Weyburn and Midale, Mr. Speaker, she needs to get out to her 
constituency more often, Mr. Speaker. Because you cannot 
know what is going on if you don’t listen to the facts and if you 
don’t open your eyes, Mr. Speaker, and that is what the 
members opposite must do, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry and 
Resources should read from his own budget document on page 
40 which said: 
 

Oil drilling is expected to decrease to 1,700 new wells in 
2005 and 1,600 new wells in 2006. 

 
And he continues on to say: 
 

Just as the number of new oil wells drilled is expected to 
decrease, drilling of new natural gas wells is also expected 
to drop in the near term. 

 
Mr. Speaker, there is a prediction in the oil industry that there 
will be 1,700 new gas wells drilled in Canada, and the Minister 
of Industry of Saskatchewan is predicting 1,600 as opposed to 



2410 Saskatchewan Hansard April 7, 2005 

. . . I said 1,700 — 17,000, he’s predicting 1,600. That’s less 
than 10 per cent of all the new gas wells to be drilled in Canada, 
he is predicting to be drilled in Saskatchewan. 
 
And then he has the nerve to stand up and say that we should 
know that there’s a boom. Well he should come to 
Weyburn-Big Muddy and see what the boom, the boom that we 
should be happening, is not happening. Ask people across the 
province. Will the Premier, Mr. Speaker, will the Premier 
reverse this tax? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well perhaps some day when the member 
visits Weyburn, I’ll accompany her to Weyburn when she goes 
there, Mr. Speaker. 
 
But I do want to say in response to that member that the 
Minister of Finance is a very cautious individual and he’s been 
cautious in his projections, Mr. Speaker. But I’m very happy to 
report to the member for Weyburn that according to On Stream, 
which is the official publication of the Petroleum Services 
Association of Canada, Mr. Speaker, they predict that drilling 
will go up 6 per cent in Alberta and 8 per cent in Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please.
