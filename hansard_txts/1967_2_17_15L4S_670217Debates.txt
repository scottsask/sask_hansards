LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Fourth Session - Fifteenth Legislature 

11th Day 

 

Friday, February 17, 1967 

 

The Assembly met at 2:30 o’clock p.m. 

On the Orders of the Day. 

 

WELCOME TO STUDENTS 

 

MR. H.H.P. BAKER (Regina East): — Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the Legislature of the High 

School Champions of Saskatchewan who are going to represent this city and this province in the Dominion 

High School Curling Finals and I might mention that they come from the Balfour Technical Institute or 

Collegiate, my home town collegiate, one of the finest schools of learning in this community. They are being 

coached by Del Gorguis, one of their teachers. The Rink is composed of Ron Jacques as skip, Arnie 

Tiefenbach as third, Bill Alderton, second, and Randy Bruce as lead. I’m sure you would want me to wish 

them every success in the Dominion Finals on behalf of yourself and this Legislature. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

STATEMENT RE: PRESS REPORT 

 

MR. G.T. SYNDER (Moose Jaw City): — Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I 

want to rise on a matter of personal privilege with respect to remarks by the Minister of Natural Resources 

(Mr. Steuart) last Wednesday relative to some remarks in a speech which I gave the previous day. Reported 

in the press both in the Moose Jaw Times Herald and the Leader Post, these remarks attributed to me were 

branded as completely false and I rise for that particular reason. I have had a host of telephone calls, Mr. 

Speaker, since the news release was printed from people who want to enlarge upon what I have already had 

to say. I have already released a statement to the Moose Jaw press and if the press in the Legislature is 

willing to accommodate me, I have a further statement that I wish to make to them later this day. I propose to 

do everything that I may do, Mr. Speaker, to bring about a complete investigation into this particular 

institution, and if the Minister of Natural Resources has any notion that I may apologize or retract anything 

that I have said up until this time, I hope he won’t hold his breath because he will be a long time without 

oxygen. 

 

MR. SPEAKER: — The question of privilege is something which affects the privilege of a Member 

conducting his duty as a Member of the House. If such was the case it should be referred to the committee on 

Privileges and Elections and that is a decision for the House itself to make. The Committee on Privileges and 

Elections will report back to the House. That is the question for 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

429 

the House to decide. 

 

CONDOLENCES 

 

MR. I.C. NOLLET (Cutknife): — Before we proceed to the Orders of the Day I should very much like to 

bring to the attention of this House — perhaps it was the intention of the Premier to do so — of the passing 

of a very notable citizen of the province and more particularly an outstanding public servant who has served 

30 years as the Deputy Minister of Agriculture under some ten Ministers of Agriculture. It was my privilege 

to be so associated with Mr. Hedley Auld. This man has not only given an outstanding contribution to the 

agricultural aspects of our economy but in many other fields as well, both to the University where he 

organized the Agricultural Extension Services there and later as every one knows as Chancellor of the 

University of Saskatchewan. He was active in many local organizations and in his church as well. I will 

always remember him, as I think we all will, that is all who knew Dr. Auld, as a man of outstanding 

integrity, a man who lived a most exemplary life and who won the respect of all who came in contact with 

him. I am sure all Hon. Members present would join with me in paying tribute to this great man, our regrets 

at his passing an dour condolences to the immediate family and all others who mourn his passing. 

 

HON. J.W. GARDINER (Minister of Public Works): — Mr. Speaker, I would just like to add a few 

words to what the Member for Cutknife (Mr. Nollet) has said with regard to the late Mr. Auld. I had the 

opportunity, although there was a great divergence in age, of meeting Mr. Auld on many occasion and 

knowing him in a personal way, also of knowing some of his activities in the field of government in this 

province over the many years that he gave many years of valuable service to Saskatchewan. I am quite 

certain that all Members of this side of the House, as well as Members on the Opposition side of the House, 

would like to be associated with the remarks of the former Minister (Mr. Nollet) with regard to a man who 

has served our province well in the past and I believe deserves the recognition for this of all the citizens of 

the province, particularly in the field of our basic industry, agriculture, which, of course Mr. Auld played 

such a very active part in as Deputy Minister of Agriculture. 

 

SASKATCHEWAN SAVINGS BONDS 

 

HON. W. ROSS THATCHER (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker about a week ago the 

Saskatchewan government began its sale of Savings Bonds. It occurred to me that the House may be 

interested in the results for the first three days. I may say that $1,238,500 were sold in the first three days, 

which is about $300,000 better than a year ago. There is always a tendency for bond purchasers to hold off 

until toward the end of the campaign, but we are hoping that we shall achieve a figure of $15,000,000 before 

the sale has been completed. 



 

February 17, 1967 

430 

 

Mr. Speaker, while I am on my feet I should like to say that I have a message from the Lieutenant Governor. 

 

MESSAGE FROM HIS HONOUR THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR 

 

MR. SPEAKER: — The Lieutenant Governor transmits Estimates of certain sums required for the service 

of the Province for the 12 months, ending March 31, 1968, and Supplementary Estimates of certain sums 

required for the service of the Province for the 12 months ending March 31, 1967, and recommends the same 

to the Legislative Assembly. 

 

HON. W. ROSS THATCHER (Premier): — Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the Hon. Minister of 

Natural Resources (Mr. Steuart): 

 

That His Honour’s message, the Estimates and Supplementary Estimates be referred to the 

Committee of Supply. 

 

Motions agreed to. 

 

BUDGET DEBATE 

 

HON. W. ROSS THATCHER (Premier): — Mr. Speaker, this will mark the third occasion, on which it 

has been my privilege to present a Budget on behalf of the new Liberal government, and make the Motion of 

Supply as Provincial Treasurer. 

 

It has been my experience, that in government, there is no more difficult or frustrating task than the 

preparation of a Budget. 

 

In the process, any responsible Treasurer must remember that every dollar he spends must first be taken from 

a taxpayer, whether individual or corporate, Consequently, there must be financial limitations upon what can 

be undertaken in any single year. 

 

Months ahead of Budget Day, literally hundreds of appeals must be considered, and dozens of spending 

proposals carefully weighed. It is always easy to spend money, particularly when it is someone else’s. The 

government, therefore, initially must make every effort to curtail unnecessary or unessential spending. It 

must squeeze and trim costs until it hurts. In this day and age, we seem to have reached a point where the 

accepted, normal and necessary phenomenon of competition for electoral support has been transformed into 

an unseemly auction of favors. 

 

In this Budget, we have genuinely tried to see that the services our government is providing are in answer to 

legitimate demands. Having carried out this exercise, it is the duty of the Government to take the available 

revenues, and, 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

431 

within their limitations, establish priorities for the various spending programs. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to 

say that for the third consecutive years this government has balanced its Budget and produced a surplus. 

 

For the third straight year, we have been able to reduce the dead-weight debt of the Province. 

 

The Budget, which I am placing before the House this afternoon, endeavors to present a clear picture of the 

present financial position of the province, and the plans of the government for the coming fiscal year. In 

preparing the 1967 budget, I have kept several factors in mind. 

 

1. The promises made by the Liberal Party in the last election. 

 

2. The belief of the government that, after 20 years of Socialism, taxes in Saskatchewan are still 

dangerously high as compared to other parts of Canada. 

 

3. That our rapidly expanding province requires sharply increased spending for such fields as 

education, university, health, highways, etc. 

 

4. That much remains to be done to improve living standards for our people. 

 

In preparing the budget, we have also been obliged to keep three unique circumstances in mind. 

 

1. The overall buoyancy of our economy. 

 

Economic expansion continued at a high level during 1966. We believe this expansion will continue in the 

coming year. Yet in passing, I must sound a note of warning. Our economy is still based primarily on 

agriculture. The outlook for Saskatchewan agriculture in general appears bright. The experience over the 

years, however, must temper any such bright optimism, with the knowledge that the most promising 

prospects can be blighted almost overnight. Our prairie agricultural economy is vulnerable to the vagaries of 

weather and changing market conditions. As usual, we have prepared the Budget assuming that our crop will 

yield the average of the last ten years. 

 

2. We have been obliged to take into account the demand for public services, which continues to 

mount relentlessly. 

 

There is every indication that spending on education, the university, health, highways, etc., must far exceed 

in 1967, any previous years. Many of these expenditures are virtually uncontrollable. 

 

3. Finally, we have had to consider the new financial position of the province as a result of the recent 

Federal-Provincial Conference. 



 

February 17, 1967 

432 

 

That Conference dealt Saskatchewan a cruel financial blow. Over the years, as a have not Province, 

Saskatchewan has received huge sums in the form of equalization payments. Recently, we were notified that 

because of our changed economic position, these equalization payments would be discontinued. As a result 

of vigorous protests on the part of our Provincial Government, Ottawa relented to the extent that our 

equalization payments will be phased out over a five-year period. While this phasing out will be helpful, our 

over-all financial picture for the future has been seriously affected. 

 

Over the next five years, we shall lose in grants approximately $150,000,000 which would have been 

available under the old formula. This Government does not argue that ultimately Saskatchewan should not 

lose equalization payments if our prosperity continues. However, we do argue that the timing was both 

unfortunate and premature. As a result of depression, the war, and 20 years of Socialist Government, we 

have a great backlog of highway construction, university building, and school construction to finance. If the 

equalization payments had been continued during the period of adjustment, it would have been infinitely 

fairer to Saskatchewan. Speaking realistically, I think every citizen in Saskatchewan should realize that 

sooner or later the Government of the day will be obliged to find methods of offsetting this loss of revenue. 

Those three factors have to be considered in preparation of the Budget. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I should now like to review the highlights of the Saskatchewan economy during 1966. In most 

respects, the year has been the most prosperous in our province’s history. The main economic feature of 

1966, of course, was the fact that Saskatchewan farmers harvested the largest wheat crop ever. Virtually 

every bushel of that crop has been sold, as I say, due to Liberal policies at Ottawa. 

 

We estimate that the value of all grains produced this year taking into account the final payment by the 

Canadian Wheat Board should exceed $1,100,000,000. Partly because of higher prices, partly due to 

increased marketings, we expect livestock income to exceed the 1965 level by about 17 per cent. Thus, in 

spite of higher operating and depreciation costs, farm net income in 1966 should establish a new high level 

of about $640,000,000. 

 

In the non-agricultural sector, many new records were again established. 

 

In 1966, total investment in Saskatchewan reached about $1,116,000,000, an increase of 14.2 per cent above 

1965. This is comprised of $647,000,000 in construction, and $469,000,000 in machinery and equipment. 

 

Total new construction rose by 14 per cent. This figure was gratifying, though I regret to say that house 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

433 

construction declined, as it did elsewhere in Canada, largely as a result of tight money. 

 

Manufacturing production has made outstanding progress during 1966. Final estimates of manufacturing 

shipments should reach about $462,000,000, an increase of approximately 8 per cent. This is a significant 

increase compared to the average growth rate of 5 per cent in Saskatchewan manufacturing in recent years. 

 

Mineral production will exceed $362,000,000. This represents an increase of about 10.4 per cent over a year 

ago. We have seen particularly exciting expansion in both oil and potash. 

 

High levels of employment and income pushed retail sales to about $1,312,000,000, a gain of almost 6 per 

cent over 1965. 

 

Total personal income for 1966 is expected to reach $2,078,000,000, a rise of 13.02 per cent. On this basis, 

per capita personal income will exceed $2,000 in Saskatchewan for the first time in history. Labor income in 

1966 will reach $905,000,000, an increase of 12 per cent over 1965. In summary, Mr. Speaker, 1966 was 

again a year of new firsts and new records for our province. 

 

One year ago, in my Budget Speech, I forecast a modest surplus of about $300,000. The bumper wheat crop 

has increased revenues from consumer taxes. At the same time, the falling off of housing starts has partly 

offset the gain in the returns from the education and health tax. 

 

It now appears that total revenues in the current year will exceed estimates by almost $12,000,000. Sales tax 

receipts should exceed the original estimate of $46,2000,000 by at least $1,300,000. Gasoline tax receipts 

will likely reach $34,500,000 — $800,000 above the original estimate. Petroleum and natural gas revenues, 

including bonus bids will reach $32,500,000 close to the original estimate. Motor vehicle revenues should 

bring in about $500,000 more than the original estimates of $10,000,000. Based on current revised Federal 

estimates, receipts under the Federal-Provincial tax-sharing arrangements (excluding statutory subsidies), are 

expected to exceed the original estimate of $81,400,000 by $4,700,000. Increases in several minor revenue 

sources account for the balance of the surplus revenues. 

 

Most of this increased revenue will be used to advance capital spending. The Highways program was 

increased by $6,500,000 over the original estimate. The Department of Agriculture has advanced 

construction of South Saskatchewan Irrigation Project, in order to be able to supply water for the multi-

purpose water supply project southeast of Saskatoon in 1967. An additional $1,000,000 had been approved 

for this 



 

February 17, 1967 

434 

 

project. The Government has approved an additional grant of $500,000 to the University of Saskatchewan to 

assist in capital construction. In addition to these major over-expenditures, there are smaller authorized over-

expenditures, the details of which will be made available in the Committee of Supply. On the basis of these 

operations during the year, our original estimated surplus of $300,000 now appears to be reasonably 

accurate. 

 

I should now like to make a few comments on the Province’s Crown corporations. May I reiterate that it is 

the philosophy of this Government to encourage the industrial development of Saskatchewan by private 

enterprise. As I have indicated on numerous in the past — the establishment and continued operation of a 

Crown corporation may be justified, in our opinion, only if it meets at last one of the following 

qualifications. 

 

— If it provides an essential service to the public, which private firms are unable to supply at 

comparable cost. 

 

— If it provides useful employment which otherwise would not be available. 

 

— If it yields particularly satisfactory return on invested public funds. 

 

Since taking office, this Government has disposed of three of these publicly financed corporations which 

failed to meet these requirements on favorable terms: 

 

— Saskair. 

— Saskatchewan Guarantee and Fidelity 

— Wizewood, 

 

A fourth, the Industrial Development Fund was amalgamated with SEDCO. We believe there are other 

smaller corporations which could have made a greater contribution to the province under private ownership. 

 

The Estevan Brick Plant continues to be a problem child. From 1961 to 1964, losses totalled $337,000. By 

strengthening management, by adopting certain new policies the company for the second consecutive year 

showed a modest profit. These profits in 1966 were $35,000. However, we are far from satisfied with the 

operation, and would like to sell it to private enterprise if the opportunity should arise. With this desire in 

mind, the corporate structure was changed during the past year. 

 

The Saskatchewan Government Printing Company does not compete for private printing business. It receives 

all its business from the government and so does not incur selling expenses. During the past year, the policy 

of allocating a portion of Government printing to weekly newspapers around the province has been 

continued. You might be interested to know, sir, that weekly newspapers received $95,000 in printing 

contracts. 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

435 

This Crown corporation showed a profit of $62,000 on a volume of $576,000. 

 

The Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office has been encouraged to expand in free competition with 

private firms. New facilities have been added to provide better customer service on a progressively growing 

volume of business. Last year, SGIO had its best year in history. Volume of general insurance business 

exceeded $9,000,000. Profits were $602,000. In all 518 employees worked for SGIO directly, including the 

AAIA operation. In addition there were 626 agents. We expect that the Insurance Company will earn its 

share of the insurance business, developing out of the long-term expansion in the provincial economy. 

 

The Saskatchewan Transportation Company also experienced the best year in its history. Profits after 

depreciation were $236,000. The number of people directly employed by this corporation during 1966 was 

177. With the danger of rail line abandonment, the bus company may be called upon in the future to further 

extend its lines. 

 

The Saskatchewan Sodium Sulphate Corporation has been one of the bright spots among out publicly owned 

companies. During 1966, the company enjoyed its greatest volume to date and earned approximately 

$880,000 for the Saskatchewan taxpayer. At the present time 94 men are employed directly by this operation. 

As Hon. Members know, an additional plant is being brought into production by the corporation at 

Ingebright Lake. It is now expected that the plant, which will cost $1,500,000 will come into production 

within a few months. The estimated production capacity of the Ingebright plant is 150,000 tons. Prospects 

are excellent for another year, though two privately owned sodium sulphate mines will likely come into 

production and, of course, will provide additional competition. 

 

As I pointed out in my Budget Speech a year ago, many of the monopoly provisions of the Saskatchewan 

Timber Board have been removed. Private enterprise has been invited to establish in our northern areas and 

in rapidly doing so. In the past year net profits were about $332,000. Approximately 425 men were employed 

during the year directly by the Saskatchewan Timber Board. 

 

A special organization is being established to cut and deliver pulpwood to the new Prince Albert Mill. This 

organization will process the 1,500,000 cords required by the pulp mill in its first four years of operation. 

 

The Saskatchewan Government Telephones for many years has been an efficiently operated company. 

Unfortunately, under the Socialists all profits were drained from the company and put into Consolidated 

Revenue. Thus, an expansion was financed by borrowing. In our opinion, this procedure was contrary to all 

sound business practice. At the present time — bondholders 



 

February 17, 1967 

436 

 

have financed 82 per cent of the company. Shareholders own only 18 per cent. 

 

Now the Socialists’ policy caused the company to pay interest charges which increased annually in a 

staggering manner, as the debt burden mounted. Our government is determined to improve the equity 

position. This year we intend to allow the company to retain about 45 per cent of its profits for expansion 

within the company. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Now, this of course affects our budget position. It means that $3,000,000, which 

under Socialist policy would have gone into Consolidated Revenue, will not be available to the Provincial 

Treasury. The total proposed capital program in 1967 will be $23,800,000, an increase of $3,800,000 over 

the revised 1966 program. In 1967 it is proposed to complete the extension of direct distance dialing in 

North Battleford. The company will also convert the cities of Estevan and Weyburn to direct distance 

dialing. By the end of 1967, Mr. Speaker, 74 per cent of Saskatchewan Government Telephone subscribers 

will have access to direct distance dialing in North America. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — The conversion of 25 more exchange areas to community dial offices will be 

undertaken. By the end of 1967 there will be 186 dial offices in Saskatchewan, serving 91 per cent of all 

telephones in the province, including rural telephone subscribers. In 1966 the Government authorized 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones to commence a new cost-sharing program of extending telephone 

service to persons in Saskatchewan who did not have access to this essential form of communication. The 

response has been gratifying. In 1967, another $500,000 will be set aside to expand this new program. The 

Government will assist in the financing of the 1967 capital program by borrowing $8,000,000 for the 

Telephone Company, a decrease of $4,500,000 from 1966. Despite a large increase in the capital program 

this substantial reduction has been made possible: 

 

(a) by allowing the Corporation to retain 45 per cent of its profits. 

 

(b) by the prospect of a larger return on its investment, and 

 

(c) by a carry-forward of the current year’s advances to finance part of the 1967 capital program. 

 

The Saskatchewan Power Corporation is by far the largest of our publicly owned companies. In the past, the 

government has been most dissatisfied with the rate of return on investment for this utility. Actually, Mr. 

Speaker, if proper 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

437 

depreciation and depletion rates had been charged, we doubt whether SPC would ever have shown any real 

profits under the Socialists. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Moreover, we have contended that for to much of the expansion in the past has been 

financed by borrowing instead of through profits. And I remind you, sir, and the people of Saskatchewan that 

when this government took office only 7 ½ per cent of SPC was owned by the people; 92 ½ per cent was 

financed by bondholders. Surely this situation was a reflection on the business capacity of the former 

Socialist administration. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Under new management, Sir, under a new philosophy, SPC has made gratifying 

improvements in its financial picture. During 1966, after setting aside normal depreciation and reserves — 

and I may say those reserves are much more substantial than were set aside by a Socialist Government — we 

will show a net profit this year of $10,400,000 or 2.3 per cent of the net plant investment in service. The 

equity-debt ratio has now been improved to - equity 11 ½ per cent, bonded debt 88 ½ per cent. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Last year, the cash flow position increased from $26,600,000 to $30,800,000. Our 

Government is still dissatisfied with both the current rate of return and the debt-equity ratio. We inherited a 

situation where year after year borrowing had actually exceeded the total capital construction program of the 

Corporation. The Board of Directors and the management of SPC have taken steps to rectify this unsound 

financial picture. It will, of course, take several years to significantly alter the effects of years of 

mismanagement. Borrowing must, for the time being, continue on a large scale. The present economic boom 

in Saskatchewan has created many new mines, many new industries and all of them require vastly increased 

quantities of gas and electricity. But each year, more of this expansion will be financed from profits and cash 

flow, less by bonded indebtedness. 

 

In 1967 we expect over-all power consumption in Saskatchewan will increase by 13 per cent. Slightly more 

than $26,000,000 of the capital program will be used to increase plan generating capacity. Work will 

continue on the following projects: 



 

February 17, 1967 

438 

 

(a) 2 — 15 megawatt units at Success — $2,000,000. 

 

(b) 3 — 62.5 megawatt units at Coteau Creek — $11,300.000. 

 

(c) 2 — 150 megawatt units a Boundary Dam — $11,900,000. 

 

The principal gas transmission project in 1967 is a line from Saskatoon to Lanigan at an estimated cost of 

$1,600,000. This line is required to provide to the Alwinsal and Allan potash mines. A three-year program to 

bring gas to another 85 communities has been announced by SPC. This program, including the Rosthern-

Duck Lake project last year, will cost almost $10,000,000 and will add about 10,000 customers to the SPC 

gas system. The 1967 program is expected to serve 3,000 customers in 23 towns and villages, at a cost of 

$3,000,000. In 1967, Sir, it is estimated that the SPC will earn $12,000,000 in profit. In view of the 

improved earning picture, w will request the corporation to pay a dividend of 25 per cent of approximately 

$3,000,000 to the people of Saskatchewan out of its 1967 profits. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — This sum will go to Consolidated Revenue and in effect will offset the amount 

which will not be available from Saskatchewan Government Telephones. 

 

I should now like to say a few words about our capital financing. During the calendar year, 1966, the 

province borrowed $49,100,000, an increase of $14,800,000 from the previous year. The increase resulted 

mainly from the larger capital program undertaken by the Saskatchewan Power Corporation during 1966. 

 

With your permission, Mr. Speaker I should like to include a list of 1966 debenture issues: 

 

Date  Maturity  Coupon  Payable  Amount 

 

Mar. 15/66 Mar. 15/76  5 - 5 ½ %  Canada  $12,336,300 

Oct. 1/66 Oct. 1/86  6 1/4 %  Canada  $15,000,000 

Various 66 Various 1986  Various  Canada  $19,380,000 

 

In addition to these debentures issued, the province issued a Treasury Bill to the Government of Canada in 

the amount of $2,400,000. I would like to comment briefly on these issues of debentures. Sales of 

Saskatchewan Savings Bonds, Series No. 6, amounted to $12,336,300. This total, although less than in 1965, 

was considered most satisfactory in view of the uncertain market that has existed this year. 

 

The yield to the investor on these bonds was 5.7 per cent 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

439 

Saskatchewan Savings Bonds, Series No. 7, went on sale this week. This is the most attractive series ever 

offered to Saskatchewan residents, organizations and corporations located in Saskatchewan. Interest income 

will average 5.54 per cent over ten years. 

 

The very high interest rates prevailing in Canada during 1966 proved very costly to borrowers in the long-

term Canadian market. The province was indeed fortunate in that it only had to borrow $15,000,000 in the 

Canadian long-tem market during 1966. These 6 1/4 per cent debentures were issued on October 1, 1966 at a 

price to yield 6.45 per cent to the investor. 

 

During 1966, funds from the Canada Pension Plan were made available to the province. Saskatchewan 

borrowed from this source a total of $19,380,000 during 1966. These funds were used to finance capital 

expenditures in SPC and Saskatchewan Government Telephones. 

 

In addition to the above debentures, the Government borrowed $6,011,475 from the Municipal Development 

and Loan Fund in 1966. These proceeds were loaned to municipalities to finance projects eligible under this 

program. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the deadweight debt as of December 31, 1966, was $45,600,000, a decline of $6,300,000 

during the year. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Deadweight debt as a percentage of total gross debt declined from 8 per cent to 6.7 

per cent. 

 

Total bond redemptions during 1966 amounted to $21,500,000. The Government continued the policy of 

paying 3 per cent of the outstanding debt into sinking funds. Sinking Fund contributions in 1966, amounted 

to $18,300,000. A total of $142,500,000 was held in the sinking funds available for debt retirement as at 

December 31, 1966. 

 

The Government presently assists local governments which encounter genuine difficulty in marketing their 

debentures, by purchasing up to 50 per cent of larger issues, that is in the rural areas. As a result of this 

policy, in 1966, the government assisted local governments to finance debentures for schools, hospitals, rural 

telephones, and municipal self-liquidating projects, including water and sewage projects, and utilities by 

purchasing $5,600,000 of the debentures issued. This represented 15 per cent of the total estimated 

$37,000,000 of local government debentures issued in 1966. Hon. Members might be interested to know that 

the amount of debentures purchased by the Government in 1966 was $1,000,000 more than in 1965. 



 

February 17, 1967

In addition the Government has assisted designated industrial towns, such as Lanigan and La Ronge, by 

financing up to 100 per cent to their capital requirements until their assessments have grown sufficiently to 

enable these towns to market their debentures. 

 

During the year, because of the tight money situation, municipalities experienced some difficulty in 

obtaining funds as was the case for other borrowers. In most cases, borrowing rates increased to 7 per cent 

and even 7 ½ per cent. The same situation, of course, has prevailed right across Canada. The Local 

Government Board has issued repeated warnings about the dangers of local governments borrowing at such 

excessive interest rates. May I, as Provincial Treasurer, Sir, join in issuing a word of caution. In the interest 

of most communities I believe real restraint should be used in capital borrowing for at least another six 

months. Fortunately, there are signs in the horizon that the tight money situation may be easing. We 

sincerely hope that by this autumn the various money markets may have returned more nearly to normal. In 

the meantime, with respect, I suggest that local governments which intend to proceed with capital programs 

should continue their planning and design. 

 

The Government for some time has been giving consideration to the setting up of a Municipal Loan and 

Development Fund. The purpose of the fund, of course, would be to use the provincial credit, to loan money 

to local governments at the lowest possible interest rate. This, of course, would require the province to 

borrow substantial additional amounts of money. In view of the current tight money and high interest rates, 

the Government does not feel that the time is yet opportune for such a fund. However, we feel the proposal 

has much merit and hope that in the not too distant future some action may be taken. Now, Mr. Speaker, I 

turn for a moment to some of our major spending fields. 

 

I believe most Hon. Members would agree that in Saskatchewan, education must be given top priority. The 

huge expenditures which this Government is making on education give tangible proof that we recognize 

such a priority. Every sign indicates that pressure for huge additional spending will continue to mount 

inexorably. 

 

Total capital costs for elementary schools, collegiates, composite high schools in the coming year, are 

estimated at about $34,000,000. Our officials tell us that an estimated 610 new rooms will be added to our 

school system in the coming year. We propose to finance more than double the capital expenditures on 

composite high schools in 1967. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Last year, the Federal Government and Provincial Government spent $61,150,000 

for this purpose. In 1967 this 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

441 

budget will provide $12,400,000. The Provincial share of total capital school construction will be 

$6,600,000. This is an increase of $1,800,000 above the 1966-67 estimate. 

 

During 1967, we propose to increase operating grants to school boards by somewhere in the neighborhood of 

$3,900,000. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — The new figure will exceed $52,700,000 and will be by far the largest Provincial 

grant paid in a single year. In the coming year, we will spend $1,500,000 for northern area education — an 

increase of $400,000. In short, Mr. Speaker, total school grants in the coming year will be almost 

$70,100,000 (including $9,300,000 in federal assistance). This is an increase of $10,700,000 over the current 

fiscal year, and an increase of $6,100,000 on a net basis. The proportion of total shared costs borne by the 

Provincial Government, if we exclude federal reimbursements, will be about 51.5 per cent. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Now it is interesting to compare these huge sums, Mr. Speaker, on education. It is 

interesting to compare them to the Socialist assistance when they were in office. In their last full year, that 

was an election year, Mr. Speaker, the CCF-NDP gave schools not $70,000,000 but $37,600,000 including 

Federal contributions. The paid not 51.5 per cent of total school costs but 44.7 per cent, and as I say that was 

the highest in about 20 years of office. 

 

During the Throne Speech, I elaborated in some detail on our plans for technical school expansion. The new 

school in Weyburn, together with the expanding facilities in Moose Jaw and Saskatoon, will require sharply 

increased expenditures. We must provide for a substantial increase in enrolment in the technology courses at 

Moose Jaw and a doubling of the courses and enrolment at Saskatoon. We are, therefore, proposing to 

increase the operating budget for the technical schools by approximately $2,200,200, bringing the total in the 

coming year to about $5,000,000. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Grants made to employees being trained by industry will be doubled. This year in 

1967 the figure will exceed $225,000. This amount will now be financed by the Federal Government of 

Manpower, although the program will continue to be administered by the province. This Training - in -  



 

February 17, 1967 

442 

 

Industry Program, which was initiated last year, provides basic training for skill development to upgrade the 

labor force. It also helps to retrain employed workers who may become permanently displaced as a result of 

technological changes. The fist year of the Training-in-Industry Program was successful with approximately 

850 trainees participating. Over 1,000 employees are expected to participate in the coming year. 

 

In the current year, responsibility for the education of nurses and related health science personnel, was 

transferred from the Department of Public Health to the Department of Education. A centralized nursing 

school is being built in Saskatoon and a similar program will be undertaken in Regina within a few years. A 

shortened diploma nursing program of approximately two years in length will be instituted in these 

centralized schools. When the program becomes fully operative, the 11 existing schools of nursing will be 

phased out, with total responsibility for diploma nursing courses being assigned to the centralized schools. 

 

Expansion of the University of Saskatchewan continues rapidly. The past year enrolment in the two 

campuses was 11,650. In the coming year, we expect another 1,100 students, bringing the total to 12,750 on 

the two university campuses. So far, despite what the Socialists have said in the coming session of the 

present session, entrance of students has not been limited where academic qualifications were met. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — I would like to point out to you today, sir, that 5,800 students in the Province of 

Saskatchewan are attending university by making use of federal or provincial loans. This is four times the 

number of such loans that were made in the last year of Socialist Government. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — And I would like to also point out to you, sir, that tuition fees for university students 

today cover only 17.5 per cent of the total operating costs of our university. 

 

Most people agree today, I think, that it is absolutely vital that our universities have facilities to produce 

competently trained, well-education manpower. Thus, in the past year we had been encouraged to believe 

that there would be greatly increased federal aid for higher education. At the recently federal-provincial 

conference, we were disappointed that while we gained some help for universities, we lost Federal 

Government assistance on some aspects of the operating costs of trade training, apprenticeship training and 

vocational secondary education. The net effect was most discouraging. 

 

Our Government has approved another major increase in the 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

443 

University operating budget for 1967. In 1967-68 we estimate that the total operating budget will exceed 

$28,800,000 an increase of 19.5 per cent. The operating grant from the Federal Government will be 

discontinued in 1967-68. Thus, the province will have to provide a total operating grant of $16,400,000 in 

the coming year. 

 

The capital requirements of both campuses are staggering. Presently we are completing a new Veterinary 

College at Saskatoon. We are constructing a new Dental College. Other buildings are proceeding according 

to schedule. During the coming year, we propose capital assistance totalling $11,300,000. A large portion of 

this sum will have t be financed by long-term borrowing. In short, Mr. Speaker, total operating and capital 

spending by our University this year will be $41,500,000 and of this total $27,700,000 will be financed by 

the Government of Saskatchewan. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Our Socialist friends today cry that we are short-changing our University. Once 

again, I remind the people of Saskatchewan that, when they were in power over a 20 year period, they gave 

the university an average of under $3,000,000 for both capital and operating expenses. The most they ever 

gave the university was in the election year $10,700,000. Compare that with the $27,700,000 in this budget. 

There is also a new expenditure relating to grants to colleges. There is also a new expenditure relating to 

grants to colleges. This year, the Federal Government has discontinued this assistance. Therefore, we have 

been obliged to budget for operating grants totalling $460,000 for this purpose. In addition, a $120,000 

capital grant for a new building for Campion College on the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus, 

has been provided. This is part of a total commitment of $150,000 equal to 10 per cent of the construction 

costs. 

 

Last year, for the first time, the Government provided free text books to all students in Grade nine. We 

allocated $600,000 for this purpose. The budget contains another $650,000 which will be used to provide 

free text books for all Grade ten students in the province. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Proposed expenditures by this Government for education in the coming year total 

$90,300,000 as against $72,500,000 in the preceding year, an increase of approximately $17,800,000. After 

making certain appropriate adjustments, we estimate that the net increase in expenditures on a comparable 

basis for education in the coming year will be about $12,000,000. In short, Mr. Speaker, education will take 

about 30 per cent of our total budget. 



 

February 17, 1967 

444 

 

The Department of Health continues to be the largest single spender of Provincial and Federal funds. Once 

again health costs have skyrocketed despite every effort on the part of the Government to hold the line. 

Several months ago the College of Physicians and Surgeons officially asked for an across-the-board increase 

in the fee schedule. If this were granted, it could well mean another $6,000,000 or $8,000,000 added to the 

present budget. With wages and salaries going up in virtually all fields, the College can probably make a 

case for some adjustment. However, in view of their present incomes, and in view of the provincial financial 

situation we have asked them to postpone their demands for at least one year. We hope that in the interests of 

the province, doctors can agree to this request. In the meantime we are placing $500,000 in the MCIC fund 

to permit some adjustments for general practitioners. 

 

In the coming year, the Legislature will be asked to vote $66,800,000 for public health — an increase of 

$9,400,000 over the original 1966-67 estimate. The gross spending on Health, adjusted for prepayments will 

be this year $120,600,000, an increase of $8,400,000. 

 

The total estimated costs in the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan for 1967-68 are $65,400,000. This 

represents another alarming increase of 10 per cent or $6,100,000 over the 1966-67 original estimate. 

 

The cost of medical care insurance is estimated at $26,800,000. This represents an increase of $2,200,000 or 

8.9 per cent over last year’s estimate. I remind the House that Saskatchewan continues to be the only 

province to finance alone a medicare scheme. We are most disappointed by the Ottawa decision not to 

proceed with the federal plan this year because such action will deprive our province of about $10,000,000 

during the coming year. In passing may I say that hospital and medicare premiums, or the so-called “medical 

heal tax” gave the Government about $18,400,000. This means that the direct medical and hospital head tax 

covers only about 20 per cent of the cost of the two schemes. 

 

Treatment of our mentally ill will require $13,600,000 in our budget. This will include the costs of operation 

of the mental hospitals at Weyburn, North Battleford, and Yorkton, and the training schools at Moose Jaw 

and Prince Albert. The total amount required for these institutions will be $12,600,000, about $30,000 over 

the amount appropriated in the current year. 

 

These figures indicate that although mental health care programs are expanding, the emphasis is shifting 

from institutional treatment to community out-patient care. Patients who were formerly institutionalized for 

long periods of time are now being released from the institutions after a short period of medical treatment, 

and placed in homes in the communities surrounding the regional centres. In this way, it is hoped 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

445 

that patients will be rehabilitated more quickly, as a result of community help and acceptance. 

 

About $600,000 is budgeted for improvement and repair of institutions operated by the Department of Public 

Health. This includes $310,000 at Moose Jaw, $160,000 at Prince Albert, $128,000 at North Battleford. The 

demand for new hospitals and new additions continues unabated throughout the province. In seeking to 

satisfy these demands, the Government must constantly keep in mind, that on a per capital basis, 

Saskatchewan has more beds than any other province in Canada or any state in the Union to the south of us. 

However, in the coming year, the Government proposes to spend $3,700,000 for hospital planning and 

construction as well as the retirement of capital debts. This is an increase of $300,000. In addition, as I’ve 

pointed out earlier, $750,000 has been provided in the Supplementary Estimates for the Regina Base 

Hospital. If additional sums can be spent during 1967, we shall be prepared to place extra amounts in the 

Supplementary Estimates. In short, the Health Department this year will take 22 per cent of our total net 

budget. 

 

The main task of the Department of Welfare is to look after the needs of those, who for various reasons are 

unable to provide for themselves. The Department has at all times endeavored to remove from welfare rolls 

those who are able-bodied, and in a position to become employed. At the same time, those who are in 

legitimate need. As Hon. Members know, in the past year to compensate for the rising living costs, the 

government adjusted the allowances to social aid recipients. The increase amounted to an average of 6 per 

cent. At the same time, we began participation with the Federal Government in the Canada Assistance Plan. 

The latter plan has meant increased federal financing. 

 

The staff in the Department has been increased by 68 positions during the year to enable the Department to 

take over the administration of the program from the cities of Saskatoon, Regina, and North Battleford. 

Moose Jaw and Prince Albert are continuing to administer the plan locally. The next cost of the program is 

estimated at $6,900,000 in the coming year, a decrease of $1,100,000 below the 1966-67 budget. 

 

Work has proceeded satisfactorily on the Women’s Correctional Institution during the year. The new 

building will cost $859,000 and should be completed this month. The new modern building will provide 

accommodation for 38 inmates. 

 

The new Dales House in Regina is also nearing completion. The building consists of two institutions under 

one roof — one to accommodate six seriously disturbed adolescent girls, the other to accommodate 32 

children. Five new positions have been approved for Dales House in 1967-68, bringing the permanent 



 

February 17, 1967 

446 

 

staff complement in the institution to 15. About $100,000 will be provided in the Department of Welfare’s 

budget for Dales House in 1967-68. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the increased opportunities for training and employment in the province, together with 

increased federal financing permitted us to reduce the net cost of welfare in this budget to $16,900,000 

which is a decrease from the current fiscal year of $1,800,000. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, agriculture continues to be the keystone of our Saskatchewan economy. And our 

government believes that it is our role to assist agriculture to diversify, so that a crop failure or loss of export 

markets will not totally cripple our farmers. Therefore, the bulk of our new programs in agriculture have 

been designed to advance the diversification of our farm economy. 

 

During the Throne Speech, I elaborated on these programs. I shall not take the time of the House today to 

repeat the remarks I made on that occasion. 

 

In the coming year, we shall spend a total of $11,500,000 on agriculture directly. This is about $800,000 

below last year’s estimate. This reduction is caused solely by the fact that as the South Saskatchewan project 

nears completion our payment to the Federal Government will be reduced by $2,250,000 in 1967, as 

compared to the last year. 

 

Over the past decade, more and more people in North America have come to realize that water is probably 

our most valuable natural resources. Saskatchewan has always been a province where we have been short of 

water, in the south, sometimes desperately short. With population increases and vast industrial expansion the 

demand for water is increasing to staggering proportions. The magnitude of the demand can be realized by 

the fact that one solution potash mine uses as much water as the city of Moose Jaw, which has 35,000 

people. 

 

About three years ago, the Saskatchewan Legislature recognized the urgent need to take action to conserve 

and properly utilize our water resources. It unanimously set up a Saskatchewan Water Resources 

Commission which has since undertaken a comprehensive survey of the province’s water resources. 

Activities of the Saskatchewan Water Resources Commission include: 

 

(a) The granting and supervision of water rights; 

(b) The collection of basic water use data; 

(c) The preparation of water quality objectives and regulations; 

(d) The preparation of plans for water use and development; 

(e) The coordination of multi-purpose water projects. 

 

In the coming year, the Government has allocated — $496,000 to enable the Water Resources Commission 

to continue its function of managing the water resources of this province. 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

447 

A year ago the Saskatchewan Water Supply Board was set up by this Legislature, to work in conjunction 

with the Commission. The purpose of this Board is to obtain and sell water in the same way that SPC sells 

electricity. The Board soon decided that the most critical water shortage in the province exists in the huge 

area southeast of Saskatoon. 

 

Thus, as Hon. Members know, a multipurpose project was launched to provide water to the various people 

and corporations who need it. Scheduling of the project has been greatly accelerated due to urgent industrial 

and municipal needs. The main canal reservoir component should be basically completed by the end of 1967. 

And water will be provided to the potash mines and towns in the area. Total cost of the complete project will 

be in excess of $25,000,000. Last year a start was made and $1,700,000 was spent. In the coming year, the 

government will advance $9,800,000 to finance the 1967 capital program. When the Board is able to deliver 

water, reasonable and equitable charges will be made. The charges, sir, will be expected to cover the costs of 

building and operating the supply system. In short, Mr. Speaker, the Province of Saskatchewan, over the 

years, will be obliged to spend ever increasing amounts on water development. But I am convinced that most 

of this development will be a self-liquidating asset of inestimable value. 

 

This Government, as you know, continues to give a major priority to highway spending. We believe that the 

majority of the people are no longer willing to travel on dusty, dirty, main roads. And they want and expect 

our major routes to be either paved or oiled. Our government is determined to overcome the substantial 

backlog of substandard roads throughout the province. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I remind you that in the last year of Socialist Government, total highway spending was 

$24,200,000. In the fiscal year just completed, we estimate that we shall have spent $54,000,000. In the past 

year 29,000,000 cubic yards of earth were moved. However, much remains to be done. Our Government 

proposes another increase in highway spending during the coming year. Overall expenditures during 1967-68 

will be a minimum of $56,000,000. The capital program has been increased by 32 per cent over the original 

1966-67 estimate. 

 

An amount of $8,200,000 has been provided for the construction of 10 miles under the accelerated four-lane 

construction program. The 1967-68 capital program once again reflects a major shift of emphasis toward a 

greatly increased paving program. We plan to pave 36 miles during the coming year. Provision is also made 

for the grading of 558 miles, the oiling of 626 miles, including 235 miles of re-oiling of existing highways. 

 

The urban assistance program will continue at a high level. The first major urban freeway constructed in the 

prairie 



 

February 17, 1967 

448 

 

provinces will be completed in 1967. It will provide for 60 m.p.h. traffic from south of Saskatoon into 

downtown Saskatoon, with no traffic signals or stop signs en route. 

 

An amount of $4,200,000 is provided in the 1967-68 budget for northern highways. While we recognize that 

both population and traffic are light in the north, the government is determined to spend ever-increasing 

amounts in this part of the province. Only by so doing, can we expand and develop the tremendous potential 

of northern areas. 

 

Between the time this government took office and the completion of next year’s program, the provincial 

highway system will have been increased by 12 per cent to 9,750 miles. The additional mileage will be made 

up of: 

 

1. 425 miles of grid roads integrated into the highway system; 

2. 458 miles constructed by the Department of Natural Resources and transferred to the highway 

system; 

3. 207 miles of new development roads. 

 

We shall depend again upon private enterprise crews to do the great bulk of the work. We believe that every 

road contractor in the province should be able to work at capacity. 

 

This greatly expanded highway program, Mr. Speaker will put some major strains on our budget. We shall 

be spending a minimum of $56,000,000 on highways this year, and in addition giving local governments 

$10,400,000 for road assistance. And yet, the motor user, through gasoline tax, the automobile licence tax, 

the driver’s licence fee will only yield the Treasury $47,400,000. In other words, the general taxpayer would 

be called upon to subsidize the automobile owner by approximately $19,000,000. 

 

This fact, together with our determination to give this province a highway system, second to none in Canada, 

has persuaded the Government to modify our method of financing highways in the coming year. Highway 

budgetary expenditures amounting to $49,500,000 will be financed from current revenues. However, 

$6,500,000 covering the cost of grading and paving our four-lane highways will be placed in a capital non-

budgetary account. The four-lane highways will be used for many years to come. We see no reason why the 

people who use these facilities in the future should not help pay for a portion of the cost. This procedure has 

been used by other provinces very consistently. It was used by the socialists on numerous occasions when 

they were in office. 

 

This four-lane program then will be amortized over a two-year period, with appropriate sinking funds 

provided. If revenues should rove to be more buoyant than expected, a portion or all of the $6,500,000 will 

be transferred back to the current budget. I repeat once more, this Government is determined to 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

449 

have a highway system, of which every citizen can be proud. 

 

I turn now to the Government’s proposal for expenditures on parks and recreational areas throughout the 

province. The government feels that because of the increasing number of people utilizing these facilities, 

developments of parks and recreational areas must be continued. We, therefore, propose to spend a total of 

$2,900,000 on provincial parks and other recreational areas in the coming year. It is intended that four areas 

— Lake Saskatchewan, Moose Mountain, Green Water Lake, Echo Valley — will receive major attention 

during 1967. In addition, a sum of $206,000 will be spent in the construction of new buildings in recreational 

areas, by the Department of Public Works. 

 

Up to the present time, 59 regional parks have been established in Saskatchewan and the Government 

presently has before it, two new applications for assistance. We are proposing in the budget, to increase 

grants to regional parks by $66,800 or 30 per cent. This will bring total expenditures for this purpose to 

$290,000. 

 

I turn now, Mr. Speaker, to the subject of municipal finances. Our Government has been concerned since 

taking office of the very high rates of local taxation in Saskatchewan. In order to finance the increased costs 

of municipal government, local authorities have been obliged to rely primarily on the property tax. The result 

has been that the property tax burden in Saskatchewan has risen out of all reasonable proportion, and it is 

one of the highest in Canada. Sir, I’m sure you wouldn’t object to me reminding you that while we had 20 

years of socialism, municipal local taxes went up by roughly 400 per cent. Now we’re trying to do something 

about it. Our government last year increased direct assistance to local governments, including education by 

$15,700,000. We promised to take another look at the situation again this year. 

 

During 1967, because of the extra provincial assistance, some municipalities were able to hold the municipal 

tax line. Others were able to scale down the increase. Nevertheless, the pressures continue. The loss of 

equalization payments from Ottawa has altered our revenue picture in a major way. And this fact prevents us 

from bringing as much additional assistance to local governments as we would like. However, we do 

propose to make some modest increases. 

 

As I have already indicated, this year the Provincial Government will pay an extra $6,100,000 in ordinary 

grants for education. We intend to continue to pay $1,000,000 towards the school boards’ contribution to the 

Canada Pension Plan. 

 

Last year, we increased unconditional equalization payments to rural municipalities from $600,000 to a total 

of $2,000,000 and this assistance received wide-spread acceptance from the municipalities concerned. In the 

coming year, we propose to increase equalization to local government by another $400,000 



 

February 17, 1967 

450 

 

to $2,400,000. 

 

In 1966, we inaugurated a program to bring Provincial assistance for snow removal on some of our major 

rural routes, and we made grants in the past year for this purpose, up to a ceiling of $250,000. Again, this 

program has met with widespread acceptance. In this budget, we propose to increase snow removal grants by 

$50,000 to $300,000. 

 

The grid road program, year by year, has added new mileage in rural areas. In the initial program, all 

municipalities had a given mileage to construct over a ten-year period. Next year 30 municipalities will have 

completed this program. Another ten municipalities will have one more or less left to construct. We wish to 

see the original grid road program completed in all municipalities. However, the SARM has repeatedly asked 

us to begin a program, which would permit additional assistance for feeder roads. 

 

On behalf of the Government, I wish today to announce a new policy in connection with approved feeder 

roads or collector roads. Where a municipality has completed its grid road program, in the coming year, the 

Department of Municipal Affairs will consider financial assistance on the same basis for feeder or collector 

roads. These roads link main grid roads, and may be built to slightly reduced standards, for less money. The 

Minister of Municipal Affairs will give details of our program at a later stage in this debate. 

 

We propose to increase grants for grid road construction from $5,000,000 a year ago, to $5,500,000 in the 

current budget. Maintenance grants will be paid on the same fifty-fifty basis as last year, up to a ceiling of 

$1,000,000. Thus the total budgetary provision for the Municipal Road Assistance Authority in the coming 

year will be $11,600,000. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I should also like to announce another new Government program, which we think will help 

local governments. At the present time, farmers who are installing water and sewer systems on the farm, 

receive an individual grant up to $300. At the same time, the larger urban centres who install conventional 

system may also receive financial assistance. 

 

Several years ago, the Government began a new program, using plastic pipe to bring a cheaper water system 

to smaller hamlets. And there has been a good deal of interest and participation in this program. However, up 

until now there has been no grant available to such projects. The local government board, of course, 

approves the financial arrangements made of each individual application. In a general way, they demand a 

good deal higher repayment for the smaller centres, and a much shorter term of debenture issue, for obvious 

reasons. The government believes that people in these smaller centres have a right to modern water services, 

though, of course, we must be careful not to encourage installation of systems in communities

that are declining. 

 

I wish to announce today that effective April 1st, the Department of Municipal Affairs will be prepared to 

make cash grants to municipalities up to a maximum of $100 per connection. The average number of 

connections in these systems runs from 20 to 30. Therefore, we estimate that the department will be called 

upon to make an average grant of approximately $2,000. We expect the whole program next year to cost in 

the neighborhood of $50,000. 

 

May I now say a few words about the homeowner grant. The Liberal Party has long expressed concern over 

the high level of local taxation. And again I must remind you, Sir, that during the years we had a Socialist 

Government those taxes did go up by 400 per cent without my hon. friends opposite doing much about it. 

Now, last year, in an effort to help the property owner, our Government introduced the homeowner grant. 

That grant has been paid directly to most Saskatchewan residents who lived in their home for six months or 

more. In the last year total grants amounted to $8,200,000. On the whole the legislation has been well 

received. Dozens of homeowners have appreciated the assistance that they have been given as a result of this 

legislation; and many municipalities have indicated that the legislation has been of great value in ensuring 

that municipal issues are paid on time. For example, I’d like to read a letter from Wilfred Geber, the 

Secretary-Treasurer of the R.M. of Benson, No. 35: 

 

On behalf of the reeve and the councillors of this municipality, I wish to convey our sincere thanks to 

you and your colleagues for implementing the homeowner grant. Because of this and the buoyant 

economy of Saskatchewan, tax collections have been the best ever here. 

 

This letter is typical of a number which we have received. It is still the hope of the Government to gradually 

increase the amount of the homeowner grant. However, this year in view of the Federal equalization payment 

loss, we will continue to pay the grant on the basis of $50 per year. In this budget, we are proposing a few 

minor amendments to the Act. 1. Local improvement taxes will now be included in the calculation of the 

homeowner grant. 2. Both owners of a duplex will be eligible for the homeowner grants. 3. An eligible 

applicant who sells his home may make an application for a homeowner grant any time during the year 

before December 31st, even though he may not be occupying the house at the time of application. We 

expect, in the coming year, to pay $8,500,000 out in homeowner grants. 

 

It is generally agreed today, that many civil servants retired in past decades with pensions which are now 

inadequate. With the steadily rising cost of living, the plight of some of these individuals has become most 

difficult. At prior sessions, the government increased those public servant allowances, which were granted 

prior to April 1st, 1954. In this budget, we propose to make further adjustments covering all 



 

February 17, 1967 

452 

 

pensions granted between April 1, 1954 and April 1, 1958, which are below $1,200 per year for widows and 

$2,400 a year for other pensioners. The formula used in calculating these adjustments is based on a $10 a 

year increase in pensions for each year of service with a maximum of 35 years. Thus the maximum yearly 

increase per pensioner would be $350. The first year cost of these increases is estimated at approximately 

$33,000. 

 

For some time there has been a feeling in Saskatchewan that the assistance which the government is giving 

to libraries throughout the province is inadequate. In the past the socialist government gave nothing to cities, 

or virtually nothing. Moreover, most of our rural areas lack adequate library services. Thus, a special 

committee was set up by the government a few months ago. The committee held hearings throughout the 

province and made some very interesting recommendations. Initially, they reported that “the basic structure 

of Saskatchewan libraries appears sound. The skeleton, the framework is there, ready to build upon.” 

 

However, the committee reported that the provincial library is weak and seriously understaffed, and not 

equipped for the job it should be dong. There are two library regions organized in the province now, and the 

committee recommended that at least one more each year be established. The committee also expressed hope 

that some financial assistance could be brought to Regina and Saskatoon libraries. In 1965, Regina received 

$3,200 fro their library, Saskatoon received $2,400. 

 

In last year’s budget $372,000 was provided for our library system. In this budget, we propose to increase 

expenditures by $247,000 of which $225,000 will be in the form of new assistance. This sum will be spent 

as follows: 

 

1. A new Regional Library will be established as recommended by the Committee, in the Wheatland 

region — approximate cost $70,000. 

 

We would hope that next year the Yorkton area might be added. 

 

2. Additional financial assistance mainly for staff and books, will be given to our provincial library 

to the extent of $30,000. 

 

3. Annual provincial grants to regional libraries will be increased from 75 cents to $1.00 per capita at 

an approximate cost of $85,000. 

 

4. Grants will be made to our city libraries in the amount of 15 cents per capita. 

 

Since Prince Albert, Weyburn, and Estevan already received regional grants, they will not be 

included in this latter program. 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

453 

The new grants will replace any assistance given formerly. Approximately figures for the coming year will 

total: Moose Jaw — $5,000; North Battleford — $1,800; Regina — $19,600; Saskatoon — $17,300; Swift 

Current — $2,100; Yorkton — $1,800; Lloydminster — $560; Melville — $840. Total $49,000. If finances 

permit, the Government next year will take additional steps, until gradually the committee’s 

recommendations have been carried out. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Government in the past few months has given serious consideration to the eliminating or 

reduction of the estate tax in Saskatchewan. As Hon. Members know, the province shares this tax with the 

Federal Government — 75 per cent of the proceeds come to us, 25 per cent go to Ottawa. This year we 

estimate that the estate tax will give the government approximately $2,500,000. On the other hand, it is 

estimated that Saskatchewan loses somewhere in the neighborhood of $20,000,000, in estates which follow 

their owners to British Columbia, Ontario, the Bahamas or elsewhere annually. Our extreme climate tends to 

cause retired persons to leave Saskatchewan, taking their money with them. And this represents a loss of 

capital which is one of our vital needs. Time and again, although the money was made in Saskatchewan, the 

estate tax is paid somewhere else. Many businessmen and farmers are forced to forget plans for expansion, 

because they cannot afford the necessary reserve for estate taxes and succession duties. 

 

The fact that Alberta is abolishing the provincial share of the estate tax at the current session of the 

Legislature, will accentuate Saskatchewan’s problem. I wish to say categorically that if this government is in 

power after the next election, we shall abolish our share of the estate tax in Saskatchewan. Because of the 

current financial position the government does not feel that it can take action at the current session. 

 

I turn now to the Government’s fiscal forecast. Although we hope to see another bumper crop next year we 

have, as is the custom, based our revenue forecasts on an average and normal crop of just over 19 bushels 

per acre. While it is believed that the national economy will continue to advance, we have assumed a slightly 

slower growth rate than was achieved in this past year. 

 

Given these assumptions, it is expected revenues from all the major consumption taxes will be up in 1967. 

Sales tax should return about $50,000,000. Liquor profits — $21,250,000. Gasoline tax — $36,250,000. 

Tobacco tax — $4,000,000. 

 

In total we expect the revenue from the consumption taxes to increase by $9,200,000 above the original 

estimate for 1966-67. 

 

The Province’s share of income taxes, excluding the tax points granted for financing higher education, will 

exceed this year’s receipts by $8,000,000. The new unconditional fiscal 



 

February 17, 1967 

454 

 

compensation for the financing of education includes four additional points of individual income tax, which 

yield $6,000,000. One per cent more of the corporate profits, which will yield $1,500,000. An adjustment 

grant of $6,700,000 to bring our receipts under this arrangement up to $15 per capita. In addition, we are 

assuming revenues from the federal Department of Manpower of $1,500,000. This amount will be for the 

payment of 100 per cent of training costs for the use of our technical training facilities, to train adults under 

the federal manpower training program. 

 

I wish again to emphasize that this is not all net gain to the Province. 

 

During 1967, under the transitional arrangements, total equalization payments will be $26,400,000. Thus, the 

Province will lose not only one-fifth of our 1966 grant, but also the normal increase that might have been 

expected under the old formula. 

 

Receipts from Mineral Resources should yield $37,900,000, an increase of $600,000 over this year’s revised 

estimates. We expect total oil and gas revenues to reach $33,000,000. Potash revenues will be up $300,000 

to $2,100,000. This budget provides an additional $50,000 or a total of $65,000 in incentive grants to 

encourage exploration to the pre-Cambrian Shield. In total then, Mr. Speaker, we forecast that all revenues 

will amount to $303,000,000 in the coming year. This is an increase of $34,300,000 over the year we have 

just concluded. On the other hand, as I have already stated, expenditures on the programs which this 

Government intends to accelerate will also be up sharply. 

 

We expect that budgetary expenditures during 1967-68 will total $302,700,000. This should result in a 

modest surplus of $321,900. 

 

Now in the past year, the trend all over Canada, indeed in most parts of the world, has been toward heavier 

taxation. Soaring provincial budgets have been the order of the day. I want to tell you, sir today that I am 

proposing no tax increase. 

 

When this Government came into office in 1964, we found that Saskatchewan taxes on a per capita basis 

were virtually the highest in the nation after 20 years of Socialism. Since this time, the Government has 

endeavored to lower some of the most onerous levies. I remind the people of Saskatchewan that we have 

reduced the sales tax from 5 to 4 per cent. And today Saskatchewan has the lowest sales tax in all Canada, 

with the exception of Alberta. We have reduced the income surcharge from six per cent to five per cent. We 

have given farmers the privilege of using tax free gasoline in farm trucks. We have eliminated the mineral 

tax, the socialist mineral tax on farm lands. We have eliminated the sales tax on another 50 agricultural 

items. We have commenced paying homeowner grants. While it is true that in some cases there have been 

modest tax 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

455 

increases, the net effect of Liberal action on tax has been an overall reduction annually of about $20,000,000. 

 

Now I invite Hon. Members to compare this action which has transpired elsewhere. The Federal Government 

time and again recently has introduced huge tax increases and still has had staggering deficits. The 

Government of Quebec, in the past several years, has increased taxes by almost unbelievable amounts. Last 

year the government of wealthy Ontario increased taxes by approximately $200,000,000 and still it looks at 

though they’ll have a deficit of $140,000,000. My friend, the Leader of the Tories, should just look their 

budget over and compare it to ours. A short time ago, New Brunswick increased their sales tax from three to 

six per cent, a $17,000,000 increase. Two years ago, Manitoba increased their taxes by $16,500,000. Nearly 

a week or so ago, they increased their sales tax to give per cent or brought in a tax increase on a yearly basis 

by $20,000,000. Even in oil-rich Alberta, they are forecasting this year a deficit approaching $100,000,000. 

 

In passing, Mr. Speaker, I would point out that Saskatchewan has the lowest sales tax in Canada, except for 

the Province of Alberta. Despite the actions of other governments elsewhere in Canada, despite the huge 

increases in expenditures this year, and despite the fact that we are the only province financing a medical 

care scheme, this government feels that the burden on our provincial taxpayers is already too high. I am, 

therefore, proposing no tax increases or tax changes in this budget. 

 

Mr. Speaker, economic prospects in Saskatchewan are such that it would be difficult to be less than 

optimistic. Assuming at least a normal crop, I believe that prosperity will continue because it stands on an 

ever-broadening base of diversity. Saskatchewan today is a challenging and exciting place in which to live. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. THATCHER: — In this budget, I believe we have adhered to the principles of the Saskatchewan 

Liberal part. We sharply increased spending in vital fields. However, that spending has been related to the 

economic capacity of the taxpayer. We have not increased taxes at this time. Rather, our Government is 

making every effort to widen the provincial tax base by bringing new industries and mines to this province. 

Sir, I suggest that if employment at good wages, proper care of the unfortunate members of society, than I 

submit that the Liberal Government has earned such a description. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move that you do now leave the Chair. 

 

MR. A.E. BLAKENEY (Regina West): — Mr. Speaker, I’m sure we were all interested in the 



 

February 17, 1967 

456 

 

remarks of the provincial Treasurer, and I think our first words would want to be words of congratulation to 

him, because of the fine manner in which he delivered a well-prepared address, a copy of which now reaches 

my desk. Mr. Speaker, I was interested in the list of taxes which he gave, which he says were lowered by this 

Liberal Government. I wish he would have balanced the books and give this House the list of taxes which 

have been increased. Taxes on gasoline; taxes on soap and detergents, which Mr. Speaker, are hardly 

compensated for by decreases in taxes on de-beakers and turkey saddles; taxes on insurance premiums, 

mention of which I noted he left out of his budget address this day notwithstanding the fact that it was 

previously announced; the fact that Power is now being used as a tax source; the fact that local government 

taxes everywhere are spiralling. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, there are one of two things I want to deal with first. I want to deal with a few of the 

minor points, as I say, of error or omission into which the Provincial Treasurer fell during the course of his 

remarks. He suggested for example that the previous government had in all years taken away the profits from 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones. In so suggesting he displays his lack of knowledge of that 

corporation. From 1944 to well into the mid fifties, every penny that was earned by Saskatchewan 

Government Telephones was plowed back in to further capital investments. And he knows or ought to know 

that the reason for requiring dividends from Saskatchewan Government Telephones was a sound business 

reason. He know or ought to know that it was a decision based upon the Trans-Canada Telephone System 

Cost Separation Formula. By this I mean to say that telephone revenues from long distance calls which 

originated in one province and ended in another were divided on the basis of a formula and that in the 1950's 

the Trans-Canada Telephone System amended that formula, amended it in order to make it necessary for 

each utility to show that I had incurred particular costs in carrying on this business, the so-called Cost 

Separation Formula. Dividends were a part of those costs. In order to get our proper and our fair share out of 

that formula we paid a dividend. Now, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate him if he has renegotiated the formula, 

but if he has not renegotiated the formula, but is not declaring a dividend, but is leaving money in 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones, then this is merely a bonus for Maritime Tel and Tel, for Bell 

Telephone Company, for B.C. Telephones, a bonus which ought not be paid by the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Now, Mr. Speaker, he said that he was leaving money in Saskatchewan Government 

Telephones. Have you had a chance to look at the Estimates and note that he was proposing in this year’s 

budget to take $3,800,000 from Saskatchewan Government Telephones compared with last year’s 

$3,900,000, a difference of $100,000. And he is using that as a n excuse for extracting $3,000,000 from the 

Power Corporation. 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

457 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Well I think, Mr. Speaker, it will be well known to anyone that looks at the 

accounting records of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation that the increase in equity holding that he was so 

proud of, is a reflection, not particularly of the increased profits, although that is true, but more particularly 

of the slow rate of growth of the Saskatchewan Power Corporation. There has been a distinct drop off in 

capital investment for power and for gas, and I venture to think that when the Power Corporation’s annual 

report is tabled, we will see that this year has been one of the lowest, perhaps even the slowest in the rate of 

growth of power generation and gas distribution, slowest for many years. They’re pulling back on the reins, 

Mr. Speaker, and they’re taking credit for it. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, the little homily which the Premier read to local governments to hold back on their 

capital investment, will I think, be treated by them with the disdain with which it deserves, because what did 

he say. He said, “Don’t undertake capital expenditure. Interest rates are too high. You should be holding 

back on your capital.” But what did he do? Not only did he spend every penny that he budgeted for in his 

own budget, but he added in capital expenditures, an additional $6,600,000 in supplementaries. It was 

$6,600,000 that could have been used to assist local government in their capital financing problems. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Mr. Speaker, he paraded before us an increase in regular school grants of $3,900,000 

as if it were something to be proud of. That will be one of the smallest and most niggardly increases in 

regular school grants in recent years. He has produced figures to prove that there is a huge increase in school 

grants, but how does he do this? He does it by piling into the school grant figures all sorts of things which 

weren’t there before. Well, I’ll just use one example, the one he used. Technical high schools — 

$12,000,000. Mr. Speaker, in the last CCF budget, there was money for technical high schools, but it was not 

in school grants. The previous CCF government paid 100 per cent of the cost of technical high schools and 

put the money in the public works vote, but this government straining to get some responsible figure for 

school grants, has taken this $12,000,00 and put it over into school grants. It doesn’t mean an extra nickel for 

school boards; it just makes the Thatcher figures look a little better. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Now, Mr. Speaker, I ant to refer to one of the factors which underlie this budget, and 

this is the government’s failure in the field of federal-provincial negotiation. Mr. Speaker, we’re still a have-

not province and what we have not, the number one thing we have not, is a competent negotiator at Ottawa. 



 

February 17, 1967 

458 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — This area of federal-provincial relations is absolutely crucial in measuring the 

competence of a Provincial Government and in this area the Government opposite has stuck out. They’ve 

swung three times and they haven’t even got close. They didn’t even hit a foul ball. All they do is make a 

few foul noises. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Let’s consider a little of the background of this problem. Since 1946 the Federal 

Government and the Provincial Governments have been seeking to find a way to distribute fairly the tax 

returns from all of the taxes collected from Canadian people. Much of the negotiation has centred on income 

taxes, corporation taxes and estate taxes. Since these negotiations started, the position of Saskatchewan has 

been put time and time again — clearly, repeatedly and unwaveringly. We have said this: a very large part of 

the personal incomes, the corporation profits and the estates, which give rise to the taxes that on these 

particular areas of activity come because of the location of large industries: industries like the electrical 

industry or the farm machinery industry, or the rubber goods industry or what have you. Where are these 

industries? They are in Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. And why are they there? Because we as 

Canadians have decided that we are going to have industry n Canada and we put up a tariff to protect that 

industry. These industries exist behind the hothouse tariff. But all Canadian should share in taxes largely 

created by these industries; taxes on corporation profits, individual incomes and estates. Simply put, Mr. 

Speaker, we say that the taxes on corporations, individual incomes and estates should be collected by the 

Federal Government, and once the Federal Government has taken out its share, we say that the balance 

should be distributed equally among all the provinces of Canada on a per capita basis. Now this we have 

advocated year in and year out. It’s never been wholly accepted, but what has been done is that provinces 

have been given credit for the taxes collected in their own jurisdiction and then additional payments have 

been made by the Federal Government to the provinces which have lower than ordinary yields. These 

payments are the so-called equalization payments. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, first the Federal Government agreed to bring these payments up to the average of the 

highest three provinces. And the Government of Saskatchewan and other governments kept plugging away 

and these governments said, “let’s have more.” and the Federal Government agreed to bring it up to the 

average of the highest two provinces. In 1963, Mr. Speaker, we thought we had achieved our objective up to 

the average of the highest province. We thought this, Mr. Speaker, because in 1963, the Federal Liberal 

government in its election platform promised in these words: 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

459 

A new Liberal Government will make equalization payments which will bring the other provinces up 

to the level of the richest in revenue per head from shared taxes. 

 

Well now, Mr. Speaker, all of us know that the Liberals were elected and we in Saskatchewan faced these 

Federal-Provincial negotiations with a good deal of optimism. But, Mr. Speaker, the results have been 

devastating. The government opposite could not get the Federal Government to redeem its pledge. I think 

that surprised nobody having regard to the value of Liberal election promises, but what really surprised me 

was that the government opposite wasn’t even able to get the Liberal government to keep the old formula. If 

that formula, which has been used in past years, had been retained, our equalization payment would be close 

to $40,000,000. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — But, Mr. Speaker, the formula was changed. No longer were provinces brought up to 

the level of the highest two provinces, much less the highest as was promised. No longer will we get 

equalization payments to the average of the highest two provinces, not even to the average of the highest 

three provinces. The facts are, Mr. Speaker, that we are only to get equalization up to the national average 

and that formula change will cost us $35,000,000 a year. 

 

MR. THATCHER: — Tell Al Johnston . . 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Our problems are due solely and exclusively to the formula change which the 

Premier was apparently powerless to stop. He just got down there with those sharpies at Ottawa and they 

took him to the cleaners. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — He probably made his little speech that he has prepared for giving to the Goldwater 

Society in Los Angeles. He gave it and he wondered why it didn’t go over. Well, it certainly didn’t. Of all 

the provinces in Canada, Saskatchewan came off worst in those negotiations. Far from being Big Number 

One, he was Little Number Two. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Since coming back he has tried to put a good face on this fiasco by talking about our 

being a have province. Now let’s be absolutely clear on this, 100 per cent of our loss came because of a 

formula change and zero per cent came from any increase in prosperity. Never in the history of this province 

has a Premier who supposedly had some influence at Ottawa been as ineffective in presenting our financial 

position. When the many failures of this Government are listed, the Premier’s 



 

February 17, 1967 

460 

 

failure as a salesman and as a negotiator is going to be very high on the list. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I want to turn to one other subject and that’s the general financial policy which this budget 

reveals. Here I’m going to hark back to some things I said two years ago. The former government followed a 

policy of, by and large, balancing its budget. We all know that this province suffered a great deal because of 

the load of debt which was incurred during the 1930s. I’m not here to blame anybody for that load of debt. 

The facts are that when we came out of the war virtually every person and every Government in 

Saskatchewan was burdened with debts. In this situation people and government used their resources to get 

their debt position in order. The result was a drain on the capital resources of Saskatchewan which carried 

right on into the early 1950s. Private citizens used their resources to pay off their debts. You can look at the 

retirement of farm debt as an example. Local governments did the same thing and so did the province. There 

just wasn’t enough money for other developments. In the light of these conditions, some of the progress that 

was made, both individually and by governments, is really remarkable. The former government believed that 

we shouldn’t be afraid of debt, particularly of the self-liquidating kind, but that we shouldn’t be incurring 

debt in times of buoyant revenues. We had some small deficits in 1961 and 1962 which were more than 

covered by surpluses in 1973 and 1964. That’s why I was disturbed, and said so, in my reply to the Premier’s 

first budget, when the Premier started down the road of deficit financing. Members will recall that this was 

done on the easy plan. He just did it by little bits. Firstly he decided that he was going to provide the capital 

funds for the University by borrowing. Secondly, he decided two years ago that he was going to strip the 

medical care fund. This he did — of about $9,000,000. And I called that budget a one-short effort. I said 

there weren’t many piggy banks left to rob. But I was wrong; it was a two-shot effort. Last year he found 

some other piggy banks. He continued his scheme of making the University finance its capital by 

borrowings. He stripped some millions out of the Student Aid Fund. He stripped a million out of the 

Saskatchewan Public Administration Foundation. With these little bits he managed to put together a 

balanced budget. But as it was inevitable, he’s now come to the end of the rope. He must either cut back 

spending or increase taxes or run a deficit budget. Mr. Speaker, he knows as we all know, that the popularity 

of this government in the country is such that he couldn’t dare cut back services or raise taxes, not just before 

an election. So he’s made his decision that he’s going to have some deficit financing in a big way. 

 

HON. D.V. HEALD (Attorney General): — When is the election? 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Well now you can choose your own date. That’s right. You pick it and we’ll be there. 

 

I want to say a few words about deficit financing. For many years, the accounts of the Province of 

Saskatchewan have 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

461 

been kept in accordance with the same fundamental principles which have been used by the Government at 

Ottawa, the Government of British Columbia, the Government of Alberta, and other provinces. Very broadly 

these principles are these. One, that in order to calculate whether you’ve got a surplus or a deficit, all 

expenses except advances on self-liquidating projects are to be charged to expenditures. Two, a self-

liquidating project is one which will pay off the money borrowed out of its own resources without the use of 

tax money. Three, in calculating the debt or asset position of the province, we should deduct from the gross 

debt assets in cash or securities and the amount of debt which represents self-liquidating projects. For 

example, an advance to Saskatchewan Government Telephones would not be charged to expenditures 

because Telephones has money to pay it off. But an advance to the Department of Highways would be 

charged to expenditures because you can’t pay for highways except out of taxes. 

 

Now in 1965, I said it would be very easy for a provincial government to pretend that it is budgeting for a 

surplus, a surplus of $329,000 or whatever the figure is, when in fact it is budgeting for a deficit. If the debt 

of the province over and above that for self-liquidating projects keeps going up, then the province is deficit 

financing whatever the budget says. In fact, Mr. Speaker, that is what is going to happen with the Premier’s 

budget this year. Now I said that the Province of Manitoba has done this in recent years and is approaching 

the time when it will have to curtail its programs or increase taxes sharply. That’s what I said in 1965 and I 

think we know what has happened. We know that they’ve had to put up their sales tax from zero per cent to 

give per cent in order to get their affairs in shape. And then again quoting 1965, I said: 

 

The accounting system used by the Government at Ottawa and by Saskatchewan and by the other 

provinces is a good one because it gives the Legislature and the public the truest and most accurate 

picture of where we stand as a province. 

 

But the government has already started down the road of deficit financing, as I said in 1965, by the device of 

having the University borrow for capital purposes. I said in 1965: 

 

Now we must wonder whether the Government will next propose changes in our provincial 

accounting system to hide its deficits. I hope that will not be the case. If the Government believes 

that we should run our government in the red, I hope it will have the courage and honesty to show the 

deficit in the budget figures . . 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — . . I congratulate the Government for retaining our accounting system which gives 

the people the best picture of their affairs and urge it to do so when it presents another Budget.

So I said in 1965. Well, Mr. Speaker, the courage and honesty of this Government has lasted only so long as 

there were piggy banks to rob. When all the little funds have been cleaned out, in two years, the provincial 

Treasurer has decided to return to the deceptive accounting of the Liberal Government of the 1920s and the 

1930s . . 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — . . to accounting which shows a surplus when there is none. He’s decided to 

capitalize highways. He talks about the socialists doing it. Well, Mr. Speaker, I have the financial statements 

here for the year ending 1965 — you can pick any previous year — and you will find that on the balance 

sheet, the highways and the public works are carried at a figure of $1. You will not find there any large 

capital figure for highways as an asset. The trouble with capitalizing highways is that it is all right for one 

year, but sooner or later it catches up with you. Suppose you do this, this year, and next year, and the next 

year, and so on, in 1974 you’ll find yourself paying not for the highways of 1975 only, but for those of 1967, 

1968, and 1969 and 1970, ’71, ’72, ’73, and ’74. There’s precious little left for the highways of 1975. But the 

fact are that we are going to be building highways at just as great a rate in the year 1975 as we do now, and 

the only way we can do this is to continue the snow-balling of deficit financing or also pay as we go. The 

policy introduced by the Treasurer is one of short term opportunism and a long-run folly. It’s deceptive. It 

will store up for us the same sort of problems they had in Manitoba when they had to increase a sales tax by 

five per cent in one short. Mr. Speaker, my objections, therefore, are two-fold, that the government has 

decided to deficit finance in a big way and, secondly, that it hasn’t had the courage to admit it. Mr. Speaker, I 

certainly will have more to say on Monday. I just want to say that I happened to read Wednesday’s Financial 

Post’s report on business in which I saw a really remarkably perceptive article on this budget, so perceptive 

indeed that I couldn’t escape the conclusion that the writer had a great deal of inside information. He was 

even able to guess that the surplus was going to be about $300,000. Remarkable, Mr. Speaker, remarkable. 

Well, may I just question the propriety of the Premier baring his soul like this to the reporter of a Toronto 

newspaper. May I just remind him that sometimes you can trust the discretion of reports for Toronto 

newspapers and sometimes you can’t. 

 

SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 

 

MR. BLAKENEY: — Surely he ought to know that. Well, Mr. Speaker, in concluding my remarks this 

afternoon, may I congratulate the Premier on the industry which he will announce on Monday. I’ve watched 

with amusement these little efforts to get a piece of the new coverage on Monday. Yes, and I looked back to 

the one in 1965, the big 1965 headline on the Monday that the financial critic for the Opposition spoke. It 

read like this: 



 

February 17, 1967 

 

 

 

463 

Big Heavy Water Plan at Estevan. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I extend the hope that Monday’s announcement will have a little more substance than its 

predecessor. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I beg leave to adjourn the debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 4:29 o’clock p.m.
