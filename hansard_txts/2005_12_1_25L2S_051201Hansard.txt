PRESENTING REPORTS BY STANDING AND 
SPECIAL COMMITTEES 

 
The Speaker: — Any further reports by standing and special 
committees? The Chair recognizes the Chair of the Public 
Accounts Committee. 
 

Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure 
on behalf of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to 

present the committee’s first report of the twenty-fifth 
legislature. 
 
And while this is our first report since we were established as a 
committee back on April 21, 2004, we have been very active. 
I’d like to say our committee likes to work rather than brag. 
 
And when we assumed responsibilities from the previous 
committee, we were faced with a backlog of work going back to 
the 2001 fall report of the Provincial Auditor. I’m pleased to 
report that the committee as of today is current in reviewing the 
extensive work of the Provincial Auditor. And we await the 
soon-to-be released 2005 fall report. 
 
We have accomplished this work by scheduling meetings both 
during and out of sitting days in the legislature. We are a 
scrutiny committee, and as such we have reviewed most if not 
all departments of the government. With valued advice from the 
auditor, we have passed dozens of motions calling on the 
various arms of government to comply with recommendations 
contained in the auditor’s reports. Our track record indicates 
that ministers and their officials would be wise to heed the 
direction that the committee provides. 
 
As well we are a watchdog for the people of Saskatchewan, 
keeping a close eye on government spending and the value 
received for our tax dollars. Why just this last meeting, Mr. 
Speaker, the auditor clearly stated that in three of the last four 
years the government has run up a deficit. We believe this kind 
of information is useful to put on the record for the people of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to present this report on our work. 
And I want to thank my colleagues on the committee for their 
diligence and their co-operation over the past year and a half. 
 
It is with pleasure, Mr. Speaker, that I move, seconded by the 
member from Saskatchewan Rivers, who serves as the 
Vice-Chair of the committee: 
 

That the first report of the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts be now concurred in. 
 

I so move. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Chair of the Public 
Accounts Committee, the member for Rosetown-Elrose, and 
seconded by the Vice-Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, 
the member for Saskatchewan Rivers: 
 

That the first report of the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts be now concurred in. 

 
Is the Assembly ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed.

The Speaker: — The motion is carried. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member from 
Moose Jaw North. 
 
Mr. Hagel: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, as we look into the galleries here today, we’ll 
recognize that there are several students who are here today, 
together with their parents and guests. These students, Mr. 
Speaker, are among the 100 students who were here in the 
building earlier this morning. And they come from all corners 
of the province; in fact the total group that was here this 
morning came from 20 different communities. 
 
And they’re here today because they participated in the 
centennial peace project. And it was their designs on peace, 
which was their own artwork and poetry, that was selected from 
a competition involving nearly 2,000 entries. They are among 
the 100 entrants whose pieces were presented to their province 
this morning and will be kept as a permanent legacy from our 
centennial year as their commitment to peace and their 
expressions of peace in the years ahead. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this morning they had an opportunity to have their 
photo taken with their Member of the Legislative Assembly and 
I would ask that — they’re with us here this afternoon — that 
those students whose winning designs are part of our 
Saskatchewan legacy of peace please stand and be 
acknowledged by all of the members of the Legislative 
Assembly. Would the students please stand. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition, the member for Swift Current. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We want to join with 
the Chair of the centennial celebrations in welcoming and 
congratulating these artists and these Saskatchewan kids to their 
Legislative Assembly. 
 
Before I get to an introduction of my own, Mr. Speaker, I do 
want to settle a friendly wager if I may while I’m on my feet. 
So let me just say this in settling it: the Pages were right and I 
was wrong. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, it’s a pleasure for me to introduce 
some very special guests in your gallery, Mr. Speaker. I would 
like to introduce to current MLAs [Member of the Legislative 
Assembly] some future MLAs. We have a number of 
Saskatchewan Party candidates who have joined us and, if I 
may, I’ll just quickly introduce them. 
 
First I guess the rose amongst the thorns, let me introduce our 
candidate for Saskatchewan Rivers, Nadine Wilson. Nadine 
could just give us a wave or stand up. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

Mr. Wall: — She was one of the first women, Mr. Speaker, to 
work as a corrections worker in a men’s provincial correction 
centre. Currently Nadine and her husband Doug own and 
operate a registered Hereford cow-calf operation and feedlot. 
She has strong roots in her community — elected reeve of the 
Paddockwood in 2001 and president of the North Central Rural 
Municipality Association in ’04. Currently she chairs the P.A. 
4-H regional finished beef show and sale, and has 12 years of 
experience working with 4-H clubs, Mr. Speaker. So we’re 
grateful she’s here. 
 
I would also like to introduce our candidate for Carrot River 
Valley. Fred Bradshaw is here. Welcome here, Fred. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — Fred is a community leader. He has experience in 
agriculture. He is a business person. He served as a town 
councillor for Carrot River, on the Carrot River fire department, 
the Carrot River United Church choir, and was a founding 
member of the northeast early childhood intervention program. 
He’s also a past president of the Saskatchewan Aerial 
Applicators Association. 
 
And also Mr. Speaker, I’d like to introduce to you our candidate 
for Saskatoon Riversdale, which is currently represented by 
someone on the government side of the House. His name is 
Fred Ozirney. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — He has been 31 years in education. He has been a 
teacher in both rural and urban Saskatchewan. He’s been the 
work education counsellor, coordinator for the Saskatoon 
Public School Division, executive director of the Saskatoon and 
District Industry-Education Council which he founded, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
And finally it’s a great pleasure to introduce someone that’s no 
stranger to this Assembly. Sitting in your gallery from Eston, 
Canada is the future MLA for Kindersley, Bill Boyd. Bill . . . 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — Now, Mr. Speaker, when people talk to me about 
Bill recently and news surrounding Eston, they don’t ask me 
about his return to politics. Rather they ask me if he’s in the 
Eston nude men calendar. I’m pleased to report that he is not, 
Mr. Speaker. And when I tell people that, they seem to be more 
interested both in the calendar and his candidacy, Mr. Speaker. 
 
He has also noted the member from Yorkton saying, Mr. 
Speaker, that he represents . . . I think he said words to the 
effect that he was tired and old. And I’ve had Mr. Boyd ask me 
to pass along to this House and to that member that with respect 
to being tired, well, he’s had a bit of a break, so he’s fully rested 
from his duties in this Assembly. And in terms of being old, Mr. 
Speaker, he also pointed out that, save maybe two, he’s younger 
than the entire cabinet on the other side of the House. 
 
Will the members welcome these candidates to their Legislative 
Assembly. 
 



December 1, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 507 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice, 
the member for Saskatoon Meewasin. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
would like to introduce through you to the entire legislature, 
two individuals sitting in your gallery. And I’d like them to 
stand up when I mention their names. These are individuals 
who provide valuable and, perhaps better said, invaluable 
service to the people of Saskatchewan. And I will be speaking 
more about their roles in my ministerial statement later on in the 
afternoon. 
 
But I would like to introduce now to the House, briefly, Mr. 
Kent Stewart who is Saskatchewan’s first full-time chief 
coroner, and Dr. Shaun Ladham, who is Saskatchewan’s first 
chief forensic pathologist, Mr. Speaker. 
 
[14:00] 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I too will have more comments 
about these gentlemen later on but would like to welcome them 
to their Assembly. It’s a pleasure to see them here today, and 
I’m very pleased to be meeting them in the Assembly rather 
than in the course of their professional work. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Walsh Acres. 
 
Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to introduce to 
you, through you, and to all members of the Assembly someone 
seated in your gallery, and perhaps she can stand when I call her 
name. She’s a dear friend and a former committee member with 
me on the SFL [Saskatchewan Federation of Labour] pension 
and benefits committee. Her name is Marg Romanow. She is 
with the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses, and I’d like to 
welcome her here today. 
 
And while I’m on my feet, Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Morin: — I’d also like to introduce to you in the west 
gallery, seated in the last pew, and perhaps he can stand as I 
mention his name, my brother-in-law, Norm Jakubowski. He 
retired last month after 31 years as an educator and 
administrator and took on a position with the Red Cross. I have 
a great deal of respect for Norm, both with respect to his career 
and as a family member, and it’s a privilege for me to be able to 
introduce him to you today, welcome him to the legislature, and 
wish him all the best success in his future endeavours. Thank 
you. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Estevan. 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to introduce to 
you and through you to all members of this Assembly, I would 
like to introduce three people seated in your gallery. And one is 
my constituency assistant, Leanne Fox. Leanne, if you’d just 
give a wave. We all know the wonderful jobs our constituency 
assistants do for us and I’m very grateful for the professional 
and courteous manner in which Leanne treats the people that 
come into our office. Accompanying Leanne are her sons, 
Brayden and Connor Fox. So I ask all members to join me in 
welcoming them. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Athabasca. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 
your gallery I’d like to have folks recognize a friend of ours that 
has worked in my office for the last month, just an incredible 
worker and incredible asset to this government and certainly to 
this minister. I’d like all members of the Assembly to recognize 
Mr. Trevor Morin, accompanied with my other assistant, Lynn, 
and to point out that Trevor is one heck of a worker. Thank you 
very much, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 

Awareness and Action in the Fight Against AIDS 
 

Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, today is 
World AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] Day and 
Aboriginal AIDS Awareness Day. Across the world we lose 
8,000 lives to AIDS every day. World AIDS Day is an 
opportunity to support the survivors of AIDS and raise 
awareness. That’s particularly important here in Saskatchewan, 
where we know the number of cases of AIDS continues to 
grow. 
 
On CBC [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation] this morning, it 
was reported that more women than men are now testing 
positive for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]. In fact 46 
per cent of the new HIV cases in Saskatchewan are women. 
What is most disturbing is that women between the ages of 15 
and 29 account for 68 per cent of female HIV cases, which 
means that the message about the danger of AIDS isn’t getting 
through to our young people. 
 
Given that this is also Aboriginal AIDS Awareness Day, we 
need to remember that the majority of Saskatchewan women 
who test positive for HIV are Aboriginal, and they are poor. On 
CBC a woman who has been living with AIDS for the last five 
years said poverty, addiction, and abuse go hand in hand with 
the disease. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the legislators here in this room can make a 



508 Saskatchewan Hansard December 1, 2005 

difference in the fight against AIDS. We can raise awareness, 
and we can act to reduce poverty and addictions. It’s time to 
make those commitments a priority. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Regina-Elphinstone. 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I too 
would like to rise on the occasion of World AIDS Day and, here 
in Saskatchewan and in Canada, Aboriginal AIDS Awareness 
Day. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we know that AIDS and HIV is a growing health 
issue for our province, especially and increasingly within the 
Aboriginal community, particularly for younger Aboriginal 
women. 
 
This government is working to improve the delivery of primary 
health services to those infected and affected and to those who 
at risk of contracting HIV to ensure they receive the care they 
need to protect their health. We are funding community-based 
AIDS organizations and regional health authorities to provide 
prevention and support services for those affected by HIV and 
AIDS. Saskatchewan Health allocated more than $327,000 for 
this fiscal year on community-based organizations that take on 
HIV and AIDS. 
 
Saskatchewan Health also provides funding for a number of 
other initiatives such as anonymous HIV testing programs, the 
staffing of HIV/AIDS nurse specialists, and community 
outreach. Mr. Speaker, there is much being done, but there is 
much more to do. 
 
I had the honour of participating in a luncheon this afternoon, 
Mr. Speaker, that was put on by the All Nations Hope AIDS 
Network and the AIDS Programs South Saskatchewan. Their 
theme, Mr. Speaker, is, “Knowledge is power. Be a leader. 
Take a stand.” And so I certainly saw a lot of leaders in that 
room, Mr. Speaker, and a lot of great people doing some very 
important work. 
 
So I want the House to acknowledge this World AIDS Day. 
And thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Estevan. 
 

Celebration of An Influential Life 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, last 
night I attended the celebration of life for a man who had a 
great impact not only on my life but the lives of many others. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Rev. Dr. Roy K. Holm passed away last 
Friday, November 25, after a lengthy battle with cancer. Rev. 
Holm was ordained at Estevan in 1961. He served St. Peter’s 
Lutheran Church in Estevan, St. Luke’s Lutheran in Midale, 
and St. John’s at Outram until 1978, then he moved to Regina. 
 

Mr. Speaker, I can remember when I was a young teenager and 
it was Rev. Holm who would pick me up every Saturday in his 
little Volkswagen Beetle and drive me to confirmation classes. 
That went on for two years. 
 
Years later he officiated at our wedding, and he also baptized 
our children. And I can remember speaking with Rev. Holm in 
this very Chamber shortly before his official retirement. And 
when I asked him what he was going to do after his retirement 
he said, I will continue to serve Jesus until the day I die. I really 
like this guy. 
 
He got his wish, Mr. Speaker. He preached his last sermon at 
the Celebration Lutheran Church just two weeks ago. His 
sermon was titled, “Farewell to the Elders.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, Rev. Holm touched the hearts and the lives of all 
who knew him. He will be missed but never forgotten. On 
behalf of all the people of the Estevan constituency, and all who 
knew him, I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Maxine, 
his children, and his grandchildren. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Moose 
Jaw North. 
 

Centennial Peace Project 
 
Mr. Hagel: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 
Saskatchewan centennial peace project was a very special 
initiative that’s been going on here in Saskatchewan throughout 
the centennial year. It’s an initiative of the Canadian Red Cross 
and SaskEnergy, and while centennials provide us many 
opportunities to celebrate the accomplishments of the past, the 
peace project is all about Saskatchewan’s future. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the peace project has actively engaged 
Saskatchewan students, inviting them to celebrate our 
centennial by sharing their views on how they, as the leaders of 
tomorrow, can create a culture of peace, caring, and respect in 
their own schools, communities and abroad. 
 
The peace project has three elements. In September almost 
2,500 students took part in the Hear the Children Peace Day 
events in Saskatoon, Moose Jaw, and Regina. And throughout 
the years students have been planting peace poles, the 
international symbol of peace in communities across the 
province. Mr. Speaker, our centennial goal was 100 peace poles 
and yesterday we reached 101. 
 
Today in the rotunda, Mr. Speaker, the work of 100 students, 
chosen from almost 2,000 entries in the Designs on Peace 
contest, were unveiled. This artwork carrying messages of 
peace, whether drawn or through the written word, will go on 
permanent display and provide a lasting message of peace from 
Saskatchewan youth. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Canadian Red Cross and 
SaskEnergy for providing this opportunity to Saskatchewan’s 
young people. And I want to acknowledge the effort of every 
student across our great province who took the opportunity to 
give voice to a legacy of peace. Thank you.

2006 Saskatchewan Order of Merit 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It’s my 
pleasure to rise in the Assembly today and honour Dr. Aruna 
Lakdawala Thakur. Dr. Thakur has been selected to receive the 
Saskatchewan Order of Merit for 2006. 
 
Dr. Thakur, a clinical professional and consultant psychiatrist 
has served mentally ill people here in Saskatchewan for over 30 
years. She has served on the board as well as chairperson for 
Larson House Detox Centre for 20 years and provided 
administrative stability to this institution which has established 
programs for patients suffering from chemical addictions. Using 
her fundraising skills, she invited community leaders to 
establish a $300,000 fund to acquire, renovate and operate this 
facility. 
 
Founder and professional director of the Anorexia Nervosa and 
Bulimia Foundation of Saskatchewan Inc. and co-founder of the 
Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Foundation of Canada, she was 
successful in establishing awareness of the epidemic nature of 
eating disorder problems provincially as well as nationally. She 
has personally established a trust fund, donating $30,000 to the 
U of S [University of Saskatchewan] and the department of 
psychiatry to educate professionals in the field of eating 
disorders. 
 
In 1984 YWCA [Young Women’s Christian Association] 
Saskatoon awarded her Woman of Distinction Award. She has 
served as president of the Federation of Medical Women of 
Saskatchewan and Canada and participated in various capacities 
with the United Way of Saskatoon and Canada. 
 
Therefore I ask other members of the Assembly to join me in 
congratulating Dr. Thakur on her unique achievements. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Eastview. 
 

Family Doctor Week 
 
Ms. Junor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. December 5 to 11 is 
Family Doctor Week in Canada. 
 
Mr. Speaker, each and every day in this country, family doctors 
diagnose and treat illness and injury, promote disease 
prevention and good health, coordinate care and advocate on 
behalf of their patients. Family doctors not only provide 
primary health care, but also a substantial portion of secondary 
and tertiary care in many communities; working from their 
offices, as well as hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, and other 
community facilities. 
 
Public surveys repeatedly show that Canadians hold family 
doctors in high regard for the quality of care they provide. And, 
Mr. Speaker, in addition to patient care, family doctors are 

involved in teaching students and residents in our 17 Canadian 
medical schools and in conducting research. 
 
Canada owes a debt of gratitude to its family doctors, and I’m 
very pleased to have this opportunity to acknowledge the work 
they do each and every day on behalf of their patients and for 
their ongoing contributions to our health care system here in 
Canada. I ask all members to join me thanking Canada’s family 
doctors and supporting Family Doctor Week in Canada. Thank 
you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 

Fee for the Century Family Farm Award 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
received this letter from the Saltcoats Ag Society and for the 
members that didn’t receive it I’d like to read it into the record. 
I quote: 
 

Dear Mr. Wartman: 
 
The Annual Meeting of the Saltcoats . . . [Ag] Society 
(founded 1888) was held Saturday November 19, 2005. At 
that meeting, we, Phyllis McCallum, Secretary and Walter 
Farquharson, Vice-President, were instructed to write to 
. . . express our Association’s extreme disappointment in 
your Department’s decision to charge farm families for the 
Century Family Farm . . . Gate Sign. 
 
Farmers have experience setback after setback in recent 
years. It should not be necessary to catalogue issues of 
extreme weather, scandalously low commodity prices, 
inadequate support systems, increasing costs around fuel 
and almost all agriculture inputs, disease and closed 
markets, etc. 
 
To have maintained a family farm operation . . . for [some] 
100 years is indeed worthy of celebration. These families 
have given much to their communities and to the province, 
and many of their sons and daughters and grandchildren 
have taken to other parts of Canada and the world the 
abilities, values and characteristics forged in their farming 
experiences and community involvements. 
 
When the honouring of Century Farm Families began it 
was indeed a worthy expression of our province’s 
gratitude for the innovation and perseverance embodied in 
these often exemplary leaders in agriculture and in 
community. In celebrating Century Farm Families 
individuals and . . . 

 
Family farm award . . . we honour these people. And, Mr. 
Speaker, it goes on. And in the shortage of time, they are asking 
the government to reconsider charging farm families for that 
gate sign. I believe the fee is somewhere in the neighbourhood 
of $300. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when we have spent hundreds of thousands on a 
100th anniversary celebration, I think it only fitting that that 



510 Saskatchewan Hansard December 1, 2005 

government would reconsider and pay for these signs. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 

Financial Status of Navigata 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, four years ago the NDP [New Democratic Party] 
government decided to spend millions of taxpayers’ dollars to 
buy a BC [British Columbia] telecommunications company 
called Navigata. Mr. Speaker, the NDP has now sunk $60 
million into Navigata and in the first 40 months of operation, 
Navigata — the NDP government through Navigata — have 
lost 42 million taxpayers’ dollars. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when the Saskatchewan Party raised this issue last 
spring the minister responsible stood up and assured this House 
and promised the people of the province of Saskatchewan that 
Navigata would turn a profit by the third quarter of 2005. Well, 
Mr. Speaker, SaskTel has now tabled its third quarter report. 
Would the minister please report as to the level of profits posted 
by Navigata? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[14:15] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
SaskTel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well as I look across the way at the conservative party opposite, 
Mr. Speaker, I sense an extreme amount of discomfort because 
I don’t know how you can sit on the fence with both feet firmly 
planted on both sides on the issue of Crown corporations, Mr. 
Speaker, as obviously that member and the opposition members 
do. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as it relates to the question, Navigata . . . The third 
quarter report clearly indicates that Navigata has experienced 
some downturn from what was originally anticipated. However, 
having said that, Mr. Speaker, it is far too early, far too early to 
project where Navigata might end at the end of the year. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the minister should maybe 
read his own . . . the third quarter report for SaskTel for this 
year. Here’s what SaskTel . . . here’s what the NDP is saying 
now: 
 

During the fourth quarter . . . [SaskTel] will complete a 
comprehensive review of the Navigata business plan . . . 
[SaskTel] will be testing whether the cash flows generated by 
the plan are sufficient to support the book value of Navigata’s 

assets . . . if the projected cash flows do not prove sufficient 
an asset write-down might be warranted. 
 

Mr. Speaker, that doesn’t sound to me like they made money in 
the third quarter of ’05. That’s what the minister promised. It 
doesn’t sound like it’s happening. And further it sounds like 
SaskTel, the NDP government, is considering writing off the 
asset. Will the minister report to the House exactly what is at 
stake in taxpayers’ dollars with this potential writedown? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
SaskTel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well as I’ve answered the question to this degree, it is far too 
early — while we’re certainly concerned, Mr. Speaker, it’s far 
too early to project what the year-end numbers might be. 
 
Mr. Speaker, however let me say this, Mr. Speaker. The 
industry remains very, very competitive in this area of voice 
over Internet, Mr. Speaker — very, very competitive. And I do 
note — I read the National Post of November 2 — MTS 
[Manitoba Telecom Services Inc.], third quarter disappoints, 
Mr. Speaker. And it’s directly related to a similar acquisition 
that they made with respect to Allstream, Mr. Speaker — 
exactly the same. 
 
So why those members opposite in Saskatchewan’s 
conservative party, Mr. Speaker, would choose to select and 
pick out SaskTel and its investment in Navigata, suggesting that 
somehow they made a bad decision while the private sector and 
SaskTel continue to be of the view, Mr. Speaker — continue to 
be of the view — that these investments are essential in 
developing modern technology in today’s global economy, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, voice over Internet protocol I 
think has been widely discussed by telecommunications across 
the company — across the country, Mr. Speaker. And I think 
it’s understood that telecommunications companies are looking 
at this option. 
 
And what we have here though, Mr. Speaker, is a situation 
where under the NDP government their option for this, which 
was to make an out-of-province investment in BC, is 
threatening SaskTel, Mr. Speaker. What are they doing to 
SaskTel? What is the NDP government doing to that company? 
 
The third quarter report says that they will be testing whether 
cash flows generated by the plan are sufficient to support the 
book value of Navigata assets. An asset writedown may be 
warranted. It is worth repeating. 
 
I want the minister to stand in his place today, Mr. Speaker, and 
explain to the shareholders of SaskTel, the taxpayers of the 
province, how much money is on the hook here for taxpayers in 



December 1, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 511 

a writedown. And more importantly, how in the world will 
SaskTel succeed as long as it’s being mismanaged by the NDP 
opposite, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister 
Responsible for SaskTel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well if the member opposite would have read the entire third 
quarter report, he would understand. When he makes a 
statement that it’s threatening SaskTel, SaskTel, Mr. Speaker, 
has a debt/equity ratio of 27.7 per cent, probably the best 
debt/equity ratio of any telephone company not only in Canada 
but in North America, Mr. Speaker — North America. 
 
Mr. Speaker, let me go on to say the following. Mr. Speaker, 
every other telephone company in North America looks to . . . 
has looked to making investments like this because they realize 
this is the modern way, Mr. Speaker. SaskTel is doing the same 
thing, Mr. Speaker. It is far too early to project, Mr. . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order. Once again 
the Minister for SaskTel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I’ll 
clarify one more point for that member if he doesn’t understand. 
If there is a writedown on the asset — and I emphasize if there 
is — it will be a non-cash writedown. It will not affect the 
dividends for SaskTel or to the Crown investments, Mr. 
Speaker. Not affect them. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, it won’t affect the NDP 
government, that’s the minister’s comfort. Sixty million 
taxpayers’ dollars that could be used for addictions treatment, 
that could be used to shorten waiting lists, that could be used to 
pay down debt or property tax relief — $60 million. But the 
minister’s not worried because it won’t affect the dividend that 
that Minister of Finance might get from SaskTel. 
 
That’s why, Mr. Speaker, it’s time for this government to go, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, in 2002 they told us it would make 
money in 2004. In 2003 they said it would make money in 
2004. They lost money — 16 million — in 2004. And then the 
minister said, don’t worry; we’ll make money in 2005. That 
hasn’t happened. Sixty million dollars hangs in the balance. 
Will he confirm that that’s the amount that’s at risk? And what 
are his plans for the future of SaskTel and the province of 
Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 

SaskTel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well let me 
again provide the broad picture for the member in case the 
Saskatchewan conservatives don’t understand this, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The investments that SaskTel have made overall — SaskTel 
International — continue to be, Mr. Speaker, overall profitable 
and they continue to be. For the last 12 years have made a 
profit, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Yet those members who purport, Mr. Speaker, to be supportive 
of our Crown corporations now — those new New Democrat 
lites, Mr. Speaker — those members purport to be supportive of 
the Crowns. They stand here in the Assembly and outside the 
Assembly regularly criticizing the Crowns and the investments 
that those Crowns — SaskTel — have made, not unlike the 
private sector who believes that this is the way that you need to 
go. SaskTel agrees with the private sector on this. They both are 
making investments in things like Navigata, where you need to 
take advantage of vehicles to expand the business in voice over 
Internet. Mr. Speaker, SaskTel is doing nothing different than 
the private sector.

Extension of Cameco Licence for Uranium 
Production at McArthur River 

 
Ms. Bakken Lackey: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Industry and Resources spoke about 
the pride he felt for the uranium mining industry and his desire 
to see that industry expand. 
 
Last week I asked the minister if he would undertake to lobby 
on behalf of Cameco and their McArthur River mine. Mr. 
Speaker, because of federal regulations the mine’s production is 
now capped well below what they are capable of producing. 
This means that the McArthur River is shut down for about one 
month a year. In fact, Mr. Speaker, they are shut down as we 
speak. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the minister: has the minister asked his officials 
to communicate with Cameco as he promised last week? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Yes of course I have, Mr. Speaker. I 
undertook to the committee that I would ask my officials to 
communicate with Cameco. That was in the evening last week. 
The very next morning at approximately 9 a.m. I met with my 
deputy minister to ask him to do just that. 
 
Because, Mr. Speaker, as I have pointed out in this House 
before and I will point out again, that party opposite pretends 
that they are somehow the developers of the uranium sector in 
Saskatchewan. And I repeat again, Mr. Speaker, our party under 



512 Saskatchewan Hansard December 1, 2005 

the leadership of T.C. Douglas invited the uranium companies 
into Saskatchewan, and the biggest expansion of the uranium 
industry, Mr. Speaker, occurred under our former premier, 
Allan Blakeney. And I say this, Mr. Speaker. There is an 
exploration boom going on in the province of Saskatchewan 
that is unprecedented, Mr. Speaker, under the policies of this 
government. No thanks to those people over there, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken Lackey: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I found it quite 
alarming last week when I questioned the Minister of Industry 
and Resources about Cameco needing to extend their licence 
and he said he’d never heard of this concern. And yesterday in 
the House, Mr. Speaker, the minister said that his government 
would take action. 
 
Mr. Speaker, could the minister then tell the Assembly if and 
when he has contacted Cameco about this issue and what action 
he is taking to ensure that the lobby goes to the federal 
government to extend the licence for Cameco? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, as I explained to that member 
in committee, I have met with the president of Cameco on 
several occasions. I have met with officials from Cameco 
regularly and as recently as the last few weeks. And it just so 
happens that the issue that the member is concerned about has 
never been raised with me by Cameco. Many other issues have 
been raised, Mr. Speaker, and we have followed up on those 
issues. Cameco has never raised that as a problem they wanted 
my intervention on. However, the member mentioned the issue; 
I asked my deputy the next day to contact Cameco to see if they 
wanted us to do anything in that regard, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, if there ever was a phony non-issue, it is this. But 
I repeat this, Mr. Speaker. This government has been 
co-operating in building the uranium mining sector. There is 
unprecedented exploration and we’ll continue to build it over 
the objections of those people over there, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken Lackey: — The Minister of Industry and 
Resources stands in this House and says this is a phony issue. It 
means . . . [inaudible] . . . in possible extra revenue from 
Cameco every year. That is money that goes directly into the 
. . . providing of employment and opportunity for northern 
Saskatchewan. It provides revenue and it provides royalties for 
all the people in Saskatchewan, and this minister says it is a 
phony, made-up issue. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the minister: when did he contact Cameco, and 

what action is he going to take in order to get this licence 
extended? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. Order please. Order. The Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, the phony issue here is the 
suggestion by the member from Weyburn that I should have 
taken up with the federal government an issue on behalf of 
Cameco that has never been raised with me. That’s the phony 
issue. 
 
The phony issue, Mr. Speaker, is the refusal of the member 
from Weyburn to accept my answer that the very next day after 
she raised it with me, I asked my officials to commence 
communications with Cameco. And, Mr. Speaker, I will find 
out what Cameco has to say, and I will report that to the House. 
 
But I would add this, Mr. Speaker. Earlier this year, this 
member from Weyburn stood up and told the House that there 
was no oil and gas activity in Saskatchewan. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
as I pointed out to her, if she would ever visit her constituency 
of Weyburn, she would know, Mr. Speaker, that oil and gas 
activity has increased in her area. But that was another phony 
issue . . .

Condition of Saskatchewan Highways 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Mr. Speaker, I’d like to read you a quote from 
when the current Premier was in opposition. Quote: 
 

If they want to encourage tourists in our province, then 
restore the roads so that driving in Saskatchewan is a 
pleasure again . . . not a challenge. 

 
Well, Mr. Speaker, this NDP government has done nothing to 
improve or restore our roads. Under this NDP government, 
driving is not a pleasure — it is a pain. 
 
And you know what else the people of Saskatchewan find 
painful, Mr. Speaker? The minister of crumbling highways is 
also the minister who brought us SPUDCO [Saskatchewan 
Potato Utility Development Company] and lost $35 million. 
The minister of giant potholes belongs to a government that lost 
$42 million in Navigata. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine how 
many kilometres of road that could have been built with that 
lost money? Wouldn’t it have been a better idea than losing it in 
government SPUDCOs? 
 
Mr. Speaker, can the minister explain why this government 
chooses to lose money on bad investments instead of ensuring 
the highways are safe? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 



December 1, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 513 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. I can tell that member what we could have done if we 
had the billions of dollars that were squandered by the 
Saskatchewan Conservatives, the right-wing government of the 
1980s that they hope to succeed some day. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I can tell you what we 
could have done with $1.2 billion of annual debt that they 
incurred. 
 
We are spending, sir, over $300 million on the roads and on the 
transportation system in this province. We have just announced 
a commitment to northerners of $65.5 million to build an 
infrastructure that . . . 
 
[14:30] 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order please. Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, as I have said, we’ve 
just committed $65.5 million to our northern communities to a 
all-weather road into the North. Is there enough money in the 
Department of Highways budget, Mr. Speaker? I wish there 
were more, but we have to have a balance. We’re paying down 
the debt that was incurred by that member there and his 
colleagues, some of them sitting upstairs, Mr. Speaker. 
 
But we’re going to continue to do what is in the interest of this 
province. We’re going to continue to pay down debt. We’re 
going to continue to build on our infrastructure . . . 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I would remind the member that — order 
please — that he knows full well not to engage any members of 
the public into the debate. The member for Biggar. 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to 
announce the NDP government has won an award. The 
Canadian Automobile Association calls Highway 51 one of the 
worst highways in Canada, and I quote: 
 

Highway 51 in Saskatchewan is a network of potholes and 
patchwork repairs, a very outdated . . . 
 

The Speaker: — Order please. Order please, members. Order. 
The member may continue. 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to read 
the quote again. 
 

Highway 51 in Saskatchewan is a network of potholes and 
patchwork repairs, a very outdated design of that road, 
very dangerous in the winter [Mr. Speaker]. 
 

Mr. Speaker, every day young people board buses and go to and 
from school on Highway 51, Mr. Speaker. And this minister of 
potholes and this government put those students at risk when 
they board those buses and drive up and down deplorable 
highways, Mr. Speaker. And also, Mr. Speaker, the oil and gas 
industry also rely on these deplorable highways as well, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Question to the minister of crumbling highways. Is he proud of 
having one of the worst highways in Canada? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, let me respond to that 
member by saying this. I am very proud about being part of an 
administration that’s been able to get a hold of the fiscal 
situation in this province and start balancing budgets, start 
paying down debt so that we could allocate some of the money 
that we are servicing on debt to repairing our highway system. 
 
Is every highway in this province in the condition that we 
would like to see it, Mr. Speaker? The answer is no, it’s not. 
Are we going to continue to strive towards a better and a safer 
highway system? The answer is yes. Mr. Speaker, but I’ll tell 
you, in terms of the long-term future of our highway network, 
we’re going to ensure that John Gerich’s right-hand man never 
sits in the premier’s chair. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Batoche. 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the minister of crumbling highways. Last 
May I raised concerns about safety and negative economic 
impact that result from the poor state of Highway 368. Since 
then nothing has been done. The highway leads to St. Brieux as 
well as a number of tourist sites like the regional park. St. 
Brieux industry has combined sales revenue of more than — 
more than — 100 million. 
 
This summer Scott Lessmeister of Bourgault Tillage Tools 
wrote me a letter about Highway 368. He writes: 
 

The safety of people traveling on this highway is our 
greatest concern, but beyond that, there’s also the wear 
and tear on vehicles that are driven over this road on a 
daily basis and the negative impact that this sort of 
infrastructure failure has on the local and provincial 
economy. 

 
Mr. Speaker, why is this highway not even part of the 
department’s current capital plan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate, I 
must say, the interest in members of the opposition that they 



514 Saskatchewan Hansard December 1, 2005 

have on particular highways. And this was an issue that was 
raised just a few nights ago as we did estimates. And I want to 
say, Mr. Speaker, that the short time that I’ve had this portfolio, 
I can’t say that we have accomplished all that we would intend 
to achieve. 
 
But I can tell you that with respect to this highway, the Minister 
of Industry and Resources has met with people in that area. I 
committed to that member that the deputy minister and his 
officials were looking at ways where we might be able to help 
with respect to that particular section of road in terms of making 
it more economic to transport the goods to their market. And we 
intend to do that. 
 
But I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that the fact that this 
government has put a $1.2 billion commitment to highways — 
now just ending — leads me to think that we need a new 
program. And I want to say, Mr. Speaker, we’re working very 
hard towards that. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, this government talks about 
tourism, but it’s hard to believe that they understand there’s a 
connection between tourism and the infrastructure. 
 
Highway No. 310 north of Foam Lake is leading to the tourist 
destination of Foam Lake. But it’s not so lovingly known in that 
area as the prairie road to the lake. I recently received a letter 
from Northome Comfort Windows. And it’s one of the largest 
businesses along that highway. And he wrote there was three 
separate incidences this summer where semis rolled over on that 
road trying to get to their business. The last incident could have 
been fatal to the driver. 
 
Larsen’s Auto Body owner has told me he goes out at least once 
a day during the summer to get some vehicle that has been in 
disrepair because of that road. He is an independent tow truck 
driver and he’s very concerned about injuries to himself, to 
vehicles, and to the many residents. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when is this government going to fix Highway 
No. 310 and ensure that not only the tow truck drivers but the 
residents in the area are safe? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, the member opposite 
and her colleagues will know that we have the most extensive 
road system anywhere in Canada, Mr. Speaker, much of it built 
to support passenger transportation in the 1960s, a lot of it. The 
thin membrane roads can’t withstand the pressure that’s been 
put on it for moving our commodities, grain, onto that system. 
 
The economic development that’s been taking place in this 
province has created pressure on some of the road systems, and 
we’ll admit that. And is it a challenge, Mr. Speaker? Of course 

it’s a challenge. And as I’ve said, we haven’t fixed all of the 
roads that we would like to fix in the manner that . . . which we 
would, but we have to deal with fiscal reality. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that conservative opposition is every day in this 
legislature spending hundreds of millions of dollars on health 
care, reducing taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. 
Speaker, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on every 
expenditure you can imagine . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Member’s time has elapsed. The Chair 
recognizes the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, this government has earned 
hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties from oil and gas 
production in the Southwest. They are about to earn hundreds of 
millions of dollars more because the anticipated 500 new oil 
and gas and CO2 wells that are expected to be developed down 
in that part of the province. Mr. Speaker, this government has 
earned substantial wealth from the Southwest, yet they refuse to 
invest money in the road infrastructure in our area. 
 
Mr. Speaker, within 48 hours of the administrator for the town 
of Consul having predicted that someone would be killed on 
Highway 21 at the regional SUMA [Saskatchewan Urban 
Municipalities Association] meeting, her prediction came true. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I spent many days in September and October 
visiting that community and talking to people in that area about 
their concerns regarding Highway 21. One lady who said, I 
have worked in Mozambique and Haiti as a volunteer and have 
found their roads aren’t as bad as ours. Mr. Speaker, it begs the 
question, when will this government take its responsibility 
seriously to the citizens of southwest Saskatchewan and fix 
Highway 21? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, the question raised by 
the member opposite is a valid question. I can tell you that there 
has been some work done on a number of highways in the south 
part of the province. And for the member to stand in this House 
to suggest that we aren’t doing work in the southwest corner of 
the province, I think he knows that not to be accurate, sir. 
 
Mr. Speaker, he stands in this House and talks about the 
pressure that’s been put on the road system by the 
ever-increasing number of oil wells that have been drilled in 
this province and the increased activity in the oil and gas sector, 
Mr. Speaker, and at the same time the member from Weyburn 
says there’s nothing happening. 
 
You see, Mr. Speaker, this is a problem with credibility. It’s the 
problem with the inconsistency of the conservatives who sit 
over on that side of the House and, Mr. Speaker, that’s why 
John Gerich’s chief of staff will never be the premier of this 
province.

member for Moose Jaw North on his feet? 
 
Mr. Hagel: — With leave to introduce a guest, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The member for Moose Jaw North has 
requested leave for introductions. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. The Chair recognizes 
the member from Moose Jaw North. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, since the proceedings began, a 
special guest of the Assembly has come to the west gallery who 
I wanted to recognize. She wasn’t here earlier when I 
introduced the students and the designs of the peace contest, but 
as we all know, the designs of the peace contest was intended to 
give voice to young people in Saskatchewan. She was the 
young woman this morning whose voice we heard speak for all 
of Saskatchewan, and her name is Amber Boychuk. She’s a 
grade 9 student at Canora comprehensive school and I would 
ask all members to join in congratulating her, not only in having 
one of her designs selected but being the spokesperson for all of 
the young people in Saskatchewan this morning. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’d 
ask for leave to also introduce the guest. 
 
The Speaker: — Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. The Chair recognizes 
the member for Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I too 
would like to join with the member opposite in recognizing 
Amber Boychuk. 
 
Amber just did such a terrific job this morning representing 
those 100 individuals and in fact representing, I understand, 
over 1,800 individuals who sent in their artwork. And she did 
just a terrific job. 
 
So I’d like to thank her on behalf of the official opposition and 
her parents, who are really strong people in the community of 
Canora. Good luck, Amber, in the rest of your studies over the 
next four years. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 

Chief Forensic Pathologist for Saskatchewan 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in the 
House today to formally introduce our province’s first-ever 
chief forensic pathologist, Dr. Shaun Ladham. 
 
The position of chief forensic pathologist is very important to 
the safety and well-being of the people of Saskatchewan, Mr. 
Speaker. The chief forensic pathologist is responsible for 
overseeing forensic services in our province including autopsy 
services. This highly specialized position is a valuable resource 
in the investigation of unexpected, unexplained, or unnatural 
deaths. As well, the chief forensic pathologist will conduct 
autopsies in the northern part of our province. 
 
Dr. Ladham comes to Saskatchewan from Allegheny County 
coroners office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he worked 
for the past seven years. He is a Canadian citizen who received 
his medical training at Dalhousie University in Halifax. He 
undertook post-graduate training in anatomic pathology at 
McGill University in Montreal and his fellowship in forensic 
pathology from the Allegheny County coroners office. 
 
As you see, Mr. Speaker, Dr. Ladham is highly qualified for 
this important position, and we are very pleased that he has 
joined Saskatchewan public service in this capacity. 
 
The chief forensic pathologist is based at City Hospital in 
Saskatoon, in partnership with Saskatoon Health Region. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in 2004, my department conducted a 
comprehensive review and consultation focusing on the field of 
death investigation in Saskatchewan. This was, in part, a result 
of one of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry 
Into Matters Relating to the Death of Neil Stonechild which 
called for a review of The Coroners Act. 
 
In response to this review, we have developed a three-year plan, 
Mr. Speaker. And I am pleased to report that we are moving 
forward in a number of areas to ensure the office of the chief 
coroner is fully up-to-date and adequately resourced. 
 
As well as adding Dr. Ladham as chief forensic pathologist, we 
earlier appointed Kent Stewart as the first full-time chief 
coroner in Saskatchewan. Mr. Stewart also brings extensive 
experience, skill, and knowledge to the field of death 
investigation. 
 
We will soon be recruiting for the position of deputy chief 
coroner. As well we intend to add a forensic pathologist in 
Regina, and two regional offices will be established in 
Saskatoon and Regina staffed by a regional coroner and two 
full-time professional coroners. 
 
[14:45] 
 
Mr. Speaker, these professionals will complement the existing 
team of more than 150 coroners throughout the province who 
investigate approximately 1,600 deaths per year. The 
improvements we have made in this area reflect our 
commitment to respond to the recommendations of the 
Stonechild inquiry, and the intent of the recommendations of 
the Commission on First Nations and Métis people and Justice

Reform. 
 
We recognize the need to provide support and expertise to the 
administration of justice and the work of the office of the chief 
coroner, Mr. Speaker. The efforts of the office of the chief 
coroner also have a positive impact on the health, safety, and 
quality of life in Saskatchewan. 
 
I invite all members to again join me in welcoming Dr. Shaun 
Ladham, Saskatchewan’s chief forensic pathologist, and Mr. 
Kent Stewart, chief coroner of Saskatchewan. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the opposition Justice 
critic, the member for Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, thank you. I appreciate the 
opportunity to join with the minister in welcoming Dr. Ladham 
to this position. 
 
I, like many people in this province, were surprised when the 
Stonechild report was made public, and it became apparent 
from that the surprising gap in the services provided by our 
coroners in this province. It was apparent there was problems 
with the legislation which have now been addressed, and it’s 
imperative that this type of issue be addressed in a timely 
manner. 
 
It’s our hope and expectation, Mr. Speaker, that the minister 
will ensure that there are adequate resources for these 
professionals to do their job in an adequate, competent, and 
professional manner. It’s absolutely essential that this process 
take place and that this office be treated with the appropriate 
professional respect that it deserves. 
 
It’s going to be part of the process that we hope to work with 
the government on, to try and restore public confidence in the 
administration of justice in this province. To often, because of 
neglect on the part of the NDP, the public perception of justice 
has slipped to an unacceptably low level, and this is something 
that we welcome as a step in the right direction. 
 
There are some 1,600 people every year in this province that die 
an unnatural or unexpected death. And it’s essential and 
imperative that we provide a service that will remove the cloud 
from those suspicious or unnatural deaths. It’s not just for the 
sake of maintaining confidence in the justice system; it’s also to 
provide comfort and closure to grieving families and to avoid 
suspicion and aspersions that may be cast towards police 
officers and other individuals. It’s part of an overall 
comprehensive scheme of dealing with justice, justice issues, 
and part of a what a competent government should deliver. 
 
So we look forward to more information updates from this 
office as it goes on. Welcome and good luck in your roles. 
Thank you.

2007 Juno Awards 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
was thrilled this morning to be part of the announcement that 
Saskatchewan has won the bid to host the 2007 Juno Awards. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — This prominent awards show will take 
place on March 30 to April 1, 2007, in the great city of 
Saskatoon. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what an exciting way to promote our vast culture 
and talent in this province on televisions across the country. The 
Junos are Canada’s largest annual celebration of music, and the 
2007 celebrations will mark the 36th year of these awards. We 
are very pleased that the beautiful city of Saskatoon will play 
host to the nation’s top musical talent. 
 
Hosting major music events like the Juno Awards give great 
profile to Saskatchewan and are incredible for the economy. 
The awards are televised nationally and will draw considerable 
media interest during the event and also in the weeks leading up 
to it. Studies done on past Juno Awards show that this event 
helps stimulate the economy, provides a good return on 
investment, and does wonders for the promotion of the area. 
Added to all of this is the great cultural benefit that results from 
hosting such an exciting event. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and 
Sciences is a not-for-profit organization that exists to preserve 
and boost the Canadian music and recording industries. They 
contribute immensely to higher artistic and industry standards. 
Since 1975 they have been handling this event and have been 
working with each segment of the music industry all over 
Canada. I applaud their efforts in exploring and developing 
opportunities to showcase Canadian artists through events such 
as the Junos. 
 
I also want to recognize the hard work of another not-for-profit 
organization called Saskatchewan Creative Music 2007 
Incorporated. This organization was formed by representatives 
and key tourism groups across the province. They helped work 
alongside the Saskatchewan Recording Industry Association to 
put together the bid to host this awards show. 
 
The Government of Saskatchewan supports the concept of 
celebrating the arts in 2007 through hosting major music events. 
Mr. Speaker, as a wonderful complement to the 2005 Throne 
Speech, this will enhance the growing recognition of 
Saskatchewan as a world-class venue for major cultural events. 
Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And thank you for 
the opportunity to respond to today’s announcement that 
Saskatchewan has won the bid to host the 2007 Juno Awards. 



December 1, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 517 

The opportunity to play host to one of Canada’s premier music 
events is a great chance for our province and the city of 
Saskatoon to highlight the best that we have to offer to the rest 
of the country. The opportunity to host the Junos will not only 
highlight the great musical and artistic talent we have in the 
province; it will provide a great economic spinoff and cement 
our growing reputation as a cultural hotbed in this country. 
 
Mr. Speaker, putting together a successful bid takes a lot of 
teamwork. I want to thank the Saskatchewan Creative Music 
2007 and the Saskatchewan Recording Industry for their work 
in putting together the bid for this show. And I would like to 
particularly thank Mayor Don Atchison and the city of 
Saskatoon for their financial support for the bid, whose hosting 
the Junos is a great opportunity for Saskatchewan. I join with 
the city of Saskatoon and the people from right across the 
province in looking forward to the year 2007. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 7 
 

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Wartman that Bill No. 7 — The Farm 
Financial Stability Amendment Act, 2005 (No. 2) be now 
read a second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, just 
a few words today to talk about The Farm Financial Stability 
Amendment Act. 
 
We have contacted a number of producers in the province, 
producer association members, farmers and ranchers, and really 
haven’t received back any negative responses to what is being 
done in this Bill. And we’ll have a number of questions to ask 
in committee later on just to verify that what we feel is 
happening here is actually happening. 
 
We believe that what we’re dealing with here is conditions of 
participation in producer associations with the guaranteed loans. 
And if I’m reading this right, Mr. Speaker, it talks about giving 
lenders and provincial inspectors greater powers to inspect 

animals owned by feeder associations. 
 
And I think, as we’ve talked in the past number of years in here, 
I think these changes are probably needed, and I’m hoping that 
they will help improve the situation out here that happened in 
my area a few years ago, where a feeder association had 
problems where a number of producers — members in good 
standing — members of that association were really burnt by 
the number of animals that were being supposedly being held in 
a feedlot and ended up were not there. And we were talking a 
large number of animals at that time and come very close to 
putting a number of producers under in the east side of the 
province. 
 
And I’m hoping that that will never happen again, and members 
in good standing will never have to have themselves put in that 
situation. So what we’re hoping that this Bill will deal with is 
some of those loopholes that we had at the time, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And at this point I would like to let this Bill go to committee, 
and we will have some questions to ask of the minister at that 
point. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion moved by the Minister of Agriculture and Food that Bill 
No. 7, The Farm Financial Stability Amendment Act, 2005 (No. 
2) be now read a second time. Is the Assembly ready for the 
question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Deputy Clerk: — Second reading of this Bill. 
 
The Speaker: — To which committee shall this Bill be 
referred? The Chair recognizes the Minister of Ag and Food. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 7, 
An Act to amend The Farm Financial Stability Act be referred 
to the Standing Committee on the Economy. 
 
The Speaker: — Moved by the Minister of Ag and Food that 
Bill No. 7 be referred to the Standing Committee on the 
Economy. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. This Bill stands to 
referred to the Standing Committee on the Economy. I 
recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 
order to facilitate the work of the policy field committees, I 
would move that the House do now adjourn. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Government House 



518 Saskatchewan Hansard December 1, 2005 

Leader that this House do now adjourn. Is it the pleasure of the 
Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. This House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. 
 
[The Assembly adjourned at 14:55.]
