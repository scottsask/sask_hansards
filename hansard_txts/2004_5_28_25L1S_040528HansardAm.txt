found to be residents of Alberta? 

 
And, Mr. Speaker, I also ask the same question for the year

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Wascana 
Plains. 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
introduce to you and through you to all colleagues in the 
Assembly 12 grade 7 students that are sitting in the west 
gallery. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’ve always been warmly welcomed by Wilfred 
Hunt School, and I hope today I’ll be able to return some of that 
hospitality. The students are accompanied this morning by their 
teacher, Dave Gawley. And I think back to a time where there 
was a wonderful celebration at Wilfred Hunt School. These are 
very environmentally friendly, green students. Their school had 
been part of the earth school program and achieved a very high 
level in that program, and we had a wonderful celebration day, 
out in the warm summer sunshine. So I would ask all members 
to welcome these wonderful students. 
 
I see their clipboards, Mr. Speaker, so I know that they’re 
wanting to learn as much as they can today, and I’ll be meeting 
with them to answer their questions later on this morning. I ask 
all of my colleagues to give the students from Wilfred Hunt 
School a very warm welcome this morning. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to 
you and through you to the rest of the Assembly, I’d like to 
introduce 12 students from grade 7, 8, and 9 in your gallery. 
They’re from Riverdale School from Kenville, Manitoba. Their 
teacher is Mr. Barry Hrappstead, I believe is the proper 
pronunciation. I could be corrected on that. 
 
But I hope they enjoy their trip to Saskatchewan here and their 
visit to the Legislative Buildings. I’ve had the opportunity of 
visiting the Manitoba Legislative Buildings, and it’s a beautiful 

building. I may be a little bit biased; I like ours just a little bit 
more. So I hope they enjoy their trip here, and I’d ask all 
members to welcome them here. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatchewan 
Rivers. 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too would like to 
welcome the 11 grade 7, 8, and 9 students from Riverdale 
School in Kenville, Manitoba. I can’t see them from here, but I 
had a peek at them from down the floor. I’d like to welcome 
them here along with, as the hon. member indicated, their 
teacher, Darcy Wohlgemuth, and their parents — Barry 
Hrappstead, Rick Penner, Andy Miller, parent chaperons. 
 
So we’d like to welcome them to this province, to this city, and 
to this Assembly. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Swift Current. 
 

Swift Current Guitarist Performs in Moscow 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s a pleasure to rise in 
the Assembly today and recognize a constituent who has 
returned home after becoming the first guitarist in the world to 
be invited to perform at the Alternativa Festival at the Cultural 
Centre Dom in Moscow, Russia. 
 
Saskatchewan-born guitarist, Gerry Dumalski and a friend, Mr. 
Speaker, travelled with Arizona-based pianist and physicist 
Harry Lyden to Russia from May 13 to May 22. Dumalski and 
Lyden are recognized as the leading authorities in the world, 
Mr. Speaker, on the Schillinger System of Musical 
Composition, an approach to music composition based on 
mathematical theories. 
 
Dumalski also conducted four lectures, Mr. Speaker, at the 
Moscow State Conservatory and the St. Petersburg 
Conservatory. He’s a professional guitarist, is Mr. Dumalski, of 
30 years. He’s written several pieces of music based on the 
Schillinger system including an original composition entitled 
“Rhapsody of Light” which he performed together with other 
worldwide performers at the Moscow Conservatory when he 
was there. His lectures at the conservatories on the 
“Electrification of Music” focused on graphic and numerical 
parameters to music composition, Mr. Speaker. What an 
amazing achievement for a resident of our province and a 
resident of the community of Pennant. 
 
I’ve had the chance to visit at length with Gerry. We have 
become friends. Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I still only know 
the three chords that I knew before I met Gerry. But I’d ask all 
members to join with me in acknowledging his amazing 
achievement in international music and his recent trip to Russia. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 



May 28, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1273 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Sutherland. 
 

Distinguished Community Service Awards 
 
Mr. Addley: — Mr. Speaker, every year the Institute of 
Chartered Accountants of Saskatchewan honours individuals 
with the Distinguished Community Service Awards. These 
awards recognize CAs (chartered accountant) and FCAs 
(Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants) who have 
provided either extensive one-time or long-term service and 
leadership in areas such as career, community, business, 
not-for-profit, and professional organizations. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this year eight chartered accountants were 
honoured at the institute’s annual general meeting and 
conference on May 26. This year’s recipients of the 
Distinguished Community Service Awards are: J. Charles 
Baldock, Lyle Bolen, Elaine Bourassa, Les Cannam, Blair 
Davidson, Ron Hicks, Ray Kolla, and Bruce Willis. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the George Baxter Achievement Award was also 
presented at this ceremony. This award is given to young 
chartered accountants who have demonstrated excellence, 
innovation, or remarkable achievements in their community, 
profession, or to the field of accounting within the province of 
Saskatchewan. This year’s recipients are Orlo Drewitz and Greg 
Keller. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in recognizing 
all of the recipients for their contribution and commitment to 
their community and their profession, and in congratulating 
them on their achievements. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Silver 
Springs. 
 

University of Saskatchewan Spring Convocation 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The University 
of Saskatchewan spring convocation was held over the last two 
days. The member from Rosetown-Elrose and I had the honour 
of participating in the ceremonies which saw some 2,910 
degrees awarded. 
 
Saskatoon-born astronaut, Dave Williams, delivered the 
convocation address at the first ceremony. He spoke about 
when he was a child watching rocket launches on television. 
His own dreams of space flight seemed impossible. But having 
spent 16 days aboard space shuttle Columbia in April 1998, 
Williams assured the University of Saskatchewan graduates that 
passion and persistence can make the wildest dreams come true. 
 
Williams is one of four people chosen by the Canadian Space 
Agency from among 5,300 applicants to join its astronaut 
training program. Quite a feat. He delighted in telling the 
audience that 600 of those 5,300 applicants were children 10 
years old and younger. Williams received an honorary degree of 
letters. 
 
Dr. Marc Baltzan, a renowned pioneer in the field of dialysis 

and renal transplants, received an honorary doctor of science 
degree. The Master Teacher Award went to Professor John 
Thompson from the department of Sociology at St. Thomas 
More College. The Governor General’s Gold Medal for 
graduate with the highest academic standing was presented to 
Angela Baerwald of Elrose. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, there was one very special graduate to me. 
My mother received her second degree. The University of 
Saskatchewan worldwide alumni is now 114,000 strong. 
 
Congratulations to the University of Saskatchewan and all 
graduates. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Yorkton. 
 

Yorkton Short Film & Video Festival 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It’s 
time again that where filmmakers from across the country enter 
their new and innovative productions into the prestigious 
Yorkton Short Film & Video Festival. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Yorkton Short Film & Video Festival is the 
longest-running event of its kind in Canada. The Yorkton Film 
Council was established in 1947, and the first festival was held 
in 1950. Over the years it has garnered its esteemed reputation 
as one of the country’s top film and video festivals. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this year’s festival kicked off yesterday. It runs 
until Sunday, May 30. A variety of workshops will be held 
throughout the weekend as well as the screenings and numerous 
films. And the prized Golden Sheaf Awards banquet and 
ceremony will be held on Saturday evening. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this year there are more than 100 nominees 
competing in 31 different categories ranging from the 
mechanics of filmmaking, to the best script, the best 
documentary, to the best animation, and much, much more. 
Delegates participating in this event have travelled from across 
the nation to take part in this world-class festival. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it is . . . I’m sure that my colleagues will join me 
in congratulating the board and the directors of the Yorkton 
Short Film & Video Festival and their staff. And I invite, and 
encourage anyone from the Assembly to make their way to 
Yorkton and enjoy the festival over the weekend. Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Carrot River 
Valley. 
 
(10:15) 
 

Senior Bowl Football Game 
 
Mr. Kerpan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I too 
want to rise today on this member statement and talk about 
accomplishments of people from Saskatchewan — in this case 



1274 Saskatchewan Hansard May 28, 2004 

young people from Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Last Monday I attended the 20th annual Ed Henick senior bowl 
football game that was held in Saskatoon at Griffith Stadium. 
Mr. Speaker, this game is a game that features graduating high 
school football players from right across Saskatchewan, and it 
is named after Mr. Ed Henick who was a big supporter and a 
big part of amateur football in Saskatchewan. Football 
Saskatchewan does sponsor the game, and it gives the 
opportunity for young people, young players from both rural 
and urban Saskatchewan the opportunity to showcase their 
talents and to perhaps be scouted by post-secondary schools. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this year the North won the football game in the 
dying seconds of the game — and a very exciting football 
game. The two MVPs (most valuable player) for the football 
teams, from the South was Teale Orban from Regina, and the 
North MVP was Andrew Busby from Delisle, Saskatchewan, 
who plays nine-man football. Mr. Speaker, Andrew Busby tied 
a record for the most receptions in the senior bowl game and 
has a very, very bright future ahead of him. 
 
Mr. Speaker, my point here is that I think rather than talking 
about football or sports, I wanted to make my point being that 
we need to support the accomplishments of young people right 
across this province — whether that be in athletics, academics, 
or the arts and culture. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Eastview. 
 

Saskatchewan Registered Nurses’ Association Awards 
 
Ms. Junor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Saskatchewan 
Registered Nurses’ Association recently recognized 10 
individuals with the 2004 Millennium Awards. These awards 
recognize nurses or members of the public who have made an 
outstanding contribution to the nursing practice and/or health 
environment. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this year’s recipients are: Penny Schafer for the 
Granger Campbell Award for clinical excellence; Sarah Gill for 
the Ruth Hicks Award for student leadership. The Effie Feeny 
Award for nursing research went to Dr. Donna Rennie and Dr. 
Norma Stewart. Diana Davidson Dick was the recipient of the 
Elizabeth Van Valkenburg Award for leadership in nursing 
education. Anne Unsworth took home the Helen Walker Award 
for innovation in nursing. And the Jean Wilson Award for 
employer of the year went to Darlene Onslow. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the SRNA (Saskatchewan Registered Nurses’ 
Association) also recognized two nurses for their lifetime of 
contributions to individuals, families, and communities in 
Saskatchewan. Betty Hailstone and Joanne Felstrom were both 
recipients of the SRNA lifetime membership. And former 
Saskatchewan premier, Roy Romanow, was awarded an 
honorary membership. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’m sure my colleagues will join me in 
congratulating the recipients of the life membership and the 
2004 Millennium Awards, and in recognizing their commitment 

to health care in Saskatchewan. I thank them for making a 
difference in the lives of people across the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 

Wrestling Gold Medal Winner 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I too rise today to recognize 
excellence in our youth and feel it’s most appropriate when the 
legislature also recognizes achievements in athletic and 
academic endeavours. 
 
One of my constituents, Pam Ewanishin, a grade 11 student at 
Walter Murray, has three times become the gold medal winner 
in . . . Canadian wrestling champion in the 46-kilo weight 
group. She is currently a member of the Canadian National 
Cadet Wrestling Team and is now in Germany — will be there 
from May 24 until May 31. And she is competing in the Hans 
Von Zons International Wrestling Tournament. And I would 
like to ask members to wish Pam well in that. 
 
I would also like to congratulate her on her gold medal that she 
has already won, and want to wish her good luck in Germany 
and as well at the Canada Cup competition which will be held 
this summer in Guelph, Ontario in July. 
 
And would ask all members to join me in congratulating Pam 
and wishing her well in the future. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Funding for Repairs to Diefenbaker Bridge 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you. Mr. Speaker, some weeks ago we 
asked some questions about the government’s commitment that 
they should have and do have to the maintenance of the 
Diefenbaker bridge in P.A. (Prince Albert). The government, 
the NDP (New Democratic Party) government, is refusing to 
pay for its share of that maintenance. 
 
The city has an agreement with the province dating back to the 
’50s to cost share any repairs to the bridge. But like many other 
promises, the NDP is refusing to keep this commitment. 
 
The minister says, Mr. Speaker, believe it or not, that the deck 
of the bridge that is being repaired isn’t actually part of the 
bridge as far as the government is concerned. Well that’s pretty 
twisted logic even by NDP standards, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The costs of the NDP share to fix the bridge — $636,000. It’s 
less than they spent on an imaginary ethanol plant. It’s 2 per 
cent of what they blew on SPUDCO (Saskatchewan Potato 
Utility Development Company). 
 
Mr. Speaker, will the Premier, will the minister keep their 
commitment to the taxpayers of P.A. on the Diefenbaker 



May 28, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1275 

bridge? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for 
Highways and Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well the members ask us whether we will keep our 
commitment and they want me to say yes. And the answer is, of 
course, yes. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the commitment and the agreement that was 
signed, the commitment and the agreement that was signed in 
the ’50s, Mr. Speaker, said that the department would look after 
50 per cent, Mr. Speaker, of the structure of the bridge in Prince 
Albert, Mr. Speaker. The surface of the bridge, much like the 
surface of the road when it needs repairs, Mr. Speaker, wouldn’t 
be considered to be part of the structure. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, this is an agreement that exists with the city 
of Prince Albert that I have to say is an exception. This does not 
exist with many other cities in the province. But having made 
that commitment, Mr. Speaker, and having signed that 
agreement we will honour our commitment. And the answer 
again is yes, we will honour our commitment, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers of P.A., the 
council of Prince Albert, and engineers kind of disagree with 
the minister. They think the part that the cars drive on is part of 
the structure of the bridge, Mr. Speaker. In fact, Prince Albert 
City Council has issued an interesting invitation to the Minister 
of Highways. They’re inviting him to come to Prince Albert 
once the deck is off on certain parts of the bridge and here’s the 
good part, and I quote: 
 

Then we will take him (the minister) across the bridge 
where the deck has been taken off and let him determine 
whether or not the deck is actually a part of the structure 
(Mr. Speaker). 

 
Well that seems pretty fair to us, Mr. Speaker. If the minister 
can cross the bridge, especially over the parts where there is no 
decking, I think we’ll all accept that the deck is not part of the 
bridge. 
 
Will the minister accept the invitation from the city council in 
Prince Albert? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Highways and 
Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well look, the 
important point and the point that I made last time this series of 
questions was asked, Mr. Speaker, is that we will continue to 
work with the city as we have done through the history of this 
province, worked with the city of Prince Albert, which is a very 
progressive city and which we see as a link into the North, and 
certainly is key in economic development in our province, Mr. 

Speaker. We’ll continue to work with them. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there is also, I need to . . . And we’ve made this 
point with the city but maybe the opposition is unaware of this. 
There is some suggestion — although we can’t be categorical 
about this, but it has happened in the past — when the funding 
that the province puts in for something like this through the 
Canada-Saskatchewan Infrastructure Program, when the 
province puts in money, the federal government could easily 
simply withdraw. So the city may not be any better off if the 
province were to add additional funds, Mr. Speaker. That’s 
been one of the discussions we’ve been having with the city and 
that’s an important consideration that needs to be given in this 
discussion. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’m 
going to be in Prince Albert on the June 9; we’re accepting an 
invitation to meet with some groups and speak there. And I’d 
like to challenge the minister to a debate, Mr. Speaker. Since 
we think we agree with the engineers in Prince Albert and city 
council that the deck, the top of the bridge is part of the bridge, 
I’ll stand on the road next to the bridge or the parts of the bridge 
where there is still decking, and the minister, for his part of the 
debate, he could stand on the part of the bridge where there is 
no decking, and we’ll even bring a personal flotation device so 
the minister can actually participate in the debate. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Prince Albert City Council does admit, Prince 
Albert City Council admits that their invitation is 
tongue-in-cheek. 
 
But the matter is serious. The Tommy Douglas government 
made an agreement to help repair . . . to share the costs of 
repairing this bridge in the ’50s. Mr. Speaker, will this Premier, 
will this government agree to keep its share, to pay for its share 
of maintenance of the Diefenbaker bridge? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Highways and 
Transportation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. If the member 
could just clarify for me again exactly where he’d be standing 
on what date and time, I’d be interested in knowing that, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to say again, though, Mr. Speaker, we 
will continue to work with the city as we have done in the past. 
There is no point in the province putting in funding if it’s 
simply going to be a withdrawal of funds by the federal 
government and the city not being any further ahead. 
 
The agreement, Mr. Speaker, as I have explained a number of 
times, is for the province to maintain and support 50 per cent of 
the structural repairs. Mr. Speaker, it has been my 
understanding, it has been the department’s position — and 
there has been additional funding through the 
Canada-Saskatchewan infrastructure I say as an aside anyway 
— but it has been the department’s position that the repairs to

repairs. But we’ll keep talking with the city of Prince Albert. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 

SaskTel Net Income in 2004 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister 
Responsible for SaskTel. In 2003 SaskTel recorded net income 
of $85 million and paid a dividend to the province of 
seventy-six and a half million dollars. Now this morning the 
NDP released SaskTel’s first quarter report. Mr. Speaker, how 
much does SaskTel now project it will make in net income in 
2004, and what does the NDP government project SaskTel will 
pay in dividends in 2004? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for the 
Crown Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, in 
a speech delivered by the Premier of Saskatchewan last fall, the 
Premier outlined a number of commitments that we would 
make as a government as we went forward when it came to our 
Crown corporations. 
 
We indicated at the time, that when we tabled our annual 
reports that they would be staggered in order to allow the 
opposition and the media and the public to have proper scrutiny. 
We also indicated that we would send a statement to all of our 
citizens in the province of Saskatchewan outlining a summary 
annual report which talks about the revenues and expenditures 
of our Crowns. And we also said, Mr. Speaker, that we would 
publish quarterly reports so that the public would understand 
how well our Crowns are doing. 
 
What I’m pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, is that consolidated 
revenue and earnings are higher after this quarter. Revenues are 
up 60 million and earnings are up 27 million, and that’s very 
good news for our Crown corporations . . .  
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, SaskTel’s 2003 annual report 
estimates that the company will profit in 2004, net income at 
between 40 million and $85 million, and it also estimates a 
dividend to the government of between 36 and $77 million. 
SaskTel’s 2004 first-quarter report indicates similar projections 
for both net income and dividend payments. But, Mr. Speaker, 
the Saskatchewan Party has acquired confidential SaskTel 
documents distributed by SaskTel’s senior vice-president, 
Diana Milenkovic, to company managers last month. Those 
documents project SaskTel’s 2004 net income at just $4.8 
million. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why is the NDP government claiming in public 
that SaskTel will make a profit up to 17 times larger than 
SaskTel’s senior vice-president is projecting in private meetings 
with SaskTel company managers? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for 
Crown Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, what we would like the 
opposition to understand is that this is the first-quarter report. 
We still have three more quarters to go, Mr. Speaker. We still 
have three more quarters to go. 
 
Mr. Speaker, these are projections. Obviously . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please, members. We ought to be able 
to hear the entire response. I recognize the minister responsible 
for the Crown Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, this is the first-quarter 
report. We have three quarters to go, and obviously we expect 
that the Crown sector will be able to provide earnings to CIC 
(Crown Investments Corporation of Saskatchewan) of $250 
million as budgeted in the Finance minister’s budget delivered 
about a month ago, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Well, Mr. Speaker, given the information 
contained on the confidential documents that we received, now 
we understand why the government can’t afford to fix the 
bridge in Prince Albert. Given these figures, they won’t have 
enough money to do anything. 
 
Mr. Speaker, according to internal SaskTel documents acquired 
by the Saskatchewan Party, SaskTel expects to spend about $20 
million this year on corporate restructuring and $30 million in 
extra payments to employee pensions. As a result, SaskTel’s 
internal estimate is that net income for the company will fall to 
just $4.8 million in 2004. And yet both SaskTel’s 2003 annual 
report and its first-quarter report for 2004 continue to project 
profits as much as 17 times higher than the internal company 
estimates. 
 
Will the minister explain to the House today why SaskTel’s 
internal net income estimates are significantly lower than the 
NDP’s public statements? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for 
Crown Management Board. 
 
(10:30) 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — What I find so interesting about the 
member’s question in the House this morning is that these 
members continue to try and throw cold water on our Crowns at 
every opportunity, Mr. Speaker. We listened very carefully to 
what the opposition had to say about SaskTel and our Crowns 
during the four years prior to the last provincial election. 
 
We have the member from Rosetown chirping from his seat. 
Well we know what he had to say about SaskTel in the last 
provincial election where it might be for sale, Mr. Speaker. 
 



May 28, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1277 

SaskTel is a company that’s highly supported by the citizens of 
this province. It’s a company that we have a great deal of faith 
in, Mr. Speaker. It delivers huge cellphone coverage in this 
province and Internet coverage to our citizens. And, Mr. 
Speaker, we continue to believe that SaskTel will report its 
earnings for the year that are appropriate, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, will the minister simply explain 
the difference between the SaskTel internal documents and the 
ones released for public exposure? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, this is a group of men and 
women that believed in the last provincial election that they 
were going to win the election, Mr. Speaker, based upon their 
internal polling. Well that’s what they projected, Mr. Speaker. 
So we don’t really pay much attention to what the members of 
the opposition have to project when it comes to our Crown 
corporations, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 

Saskatchewan Potato Utility Development Company 
Litigation 

 
Mr. Elhard: — Well, Mr. Speaker, apparently we’re not going 
to get an answer there, so we’ll try another minister in another 
issue. 
 
Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday Justice Ball threw out most of the 
NDP’s counterclaims in the SPUDCO case saying that they 
were essentially a taxpayer-funded stalling tactic. Yesterday in 
the House the minister denied that the NDP is stalling the 
SPUDCO case and said he looks forward to the trial going 
forward in October. 
 
But just a few minutes later, outside the House in the rotunda, 
the minister changed his tune and said the government may yet 
appeal Wednesday’s ruling, which could possibly delay the trial 
past the established October trial date. Mr. Speaker, isn’t this 
just another taxpayer-funded stalling tactic? Will the NDP 
accept Justice Ball’s ruling and let the trial proceed in October? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for Sask 
Water. 
 
Hon. Mr. Prebble: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that the final decision 
about whether or not an appeal will be launched will be taken 
by the deputy minister to the Premier. In other words, we’re 
going to try to keep this decision about appeal as depoliticized 
as is possible, Mr. Speaker. I just want to make that clear. But at 
this point no decision’s been made to appeal, but there will be 
consultation with legal counsel before a final decision is made. 

But I want to raise a larger question, Mr. Speaker, that the 
members opposite don’t seem to be able to accept the fact that 
we acknowledge that some mistakes were made with respect to 
SPUDCO. 
 
But you know what, Mr. Speaker, I want them to acknowledge 
that there have also been benefits from the investment, and they 
won’t acknowledge that, Mr. Speaker. And the benefits have 
translated into a potato industry in the Lake Diefenbaker area 
with a gross value of $35 million. 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. I recognize 
the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the response from the 
minister begs the question, who is really making these 
decisions? 
 
Yesterday the minister said the decisions were being made by 
the deputy minister to the Premier. But the minister also 
admitted in this House that political oversight was being 
provided by the Deputy Premier. So, Mr. Speaker, it’s clear that 
the final decision on whether to proceed with the appeal will be 
made by someone at the cabinet level. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the NDP has stalled long enough on this file. My 
question is to the Premier. Will the Premier drop the appeal and 
allow the SPUDCO trial to finally go ahead this October? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister for Sask Water. 
 
Hon. Mr. Prebble: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I don’t know how 
many times I have to explain to the member of the opposition 
that we genuinely mean it when we say that the final decision 
about whether or not this appeal will be launched will be made 
by the deputy minister to the Premier and not by a member of 
cabinet and not by cabinet. And I want to assure the member 
that that will be the case, Mr. Speaker, and I don’t know how 
much clearer I can be. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Thunder Creek. 
 

Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization Program 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister 
of Agriculture. Yesterday Statistics Canada confirmed the 
nightmare every farm family in Saskatchewan has been living 
through. Last year was the worst financial year on the farm 
since the Great Depression. 
 
Ironically it was also the day the NDP confirmed Saskatchewan 
farm families will not receive all of the provincial government 
money they qualify for under the Canadian Agriculture Income 
Stabilization program. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why is the NDP government refusing to fully fund 
the provincial share of the 2003 CAIS (Canadian Agricultural 
Income Stabilization) program when 2003 was the most 
devastating year on the farm in Saskatchewan since the Great 
Depression? 
 



1278 Saskatchewan Hansard May 28, 2004 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Agriculture and 
Food. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the question, and I appreciate as well that the 
member asking it and his family are directly affected by these 
issues. I think they affect all of this province. And when we 
look at the kind of loss of income that there is, we know that it 
has a huge impact. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have been very, very diligent in trying to work 
with the federal government to help them understand the 
terrible effect that this has on the economy of Saskatchewan. 
And in terms of our payments to CAIS, we have recognized that 
we have a capacity within this province which amounts to about 
$100 million roughly. And when we looked at these numbers 
we recognized that the estimates that the federal government are 
giving us are substantially higher. And so we are compelled, 
Mr. Speaker, recognizing this tax base, to pro-rate, and we have 
advised the producers in this province of that fact. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Thunder Creek. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Certainly, Mr. Speaker, support for agriculture 
is onerous for this province in bad years, but agriculture 
contributes greatly to the economy of Saskatchewan — not only 
in good years but also in bad years. That is because agriculture 
is more important to our economy than it is to the economy of 
any other province. 
 
The NDP has $28 million to blow on a rotten potato deal. 
There’s 26 million to blow on a dot-com in Atlanta, Georgia. 
But when it comes to supporting farm families in the worst year 
since the Great Depression, the NDP slams the door shut. 
 
Mr. Speaker, other provinces are honouring their commitments 
to farm families. Why is the NDP abandoning farm families in 
Saskatchewan in the middle of this crisis? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Agriculture. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Mr. Speaker, there is obviously a great 
confusion on the other side, when the minister just obviously 
was answering around SPUDCO and pointing out that that 
potato industry has grown substantially because of the 
investment that was made in the potato industry. Mr. Speaker, 
people that recognize that growth, recognize that this 
government is concerned and investing in agriculture. 
 
This province is investing inordinately in agriculture compared 
to other provinces, Mr. Speaker. We are putting into the 
agriculture sector more than $500 per man, woman, and child in 
this province. Far more than any other province is putting into 
the sector. 
 
Mr. Speaker, recognizing that, we are pressing the federal 
government for fairness in the programs that will make sure that 
our producers get the kind of support that they need. That is 
what we’re working on; that’s what we’re pressing for, Mr. 

Speaker, for our producers. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 

Recruitment of Urologists in Regina Qu’Appelle  
Regional Health Authority 

 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of this 
session the Saskatchewan Party has raised the cases of a 
number of men who have waited too long for either diagnostic 
tests or treatment for prostate cancer. We now know that men 
wait significantly longer in Regina for treatment for this cancer 
in comparison with Saskatoon, and that part of the problem is 
that Regina has only two urologists while Saskatoon has eight. 
 
Mr. Speaker, for three months now we’ve been bringing 
forward cases as evidence that there is a problem. What is being 
done specifically to recruit more urologists in the Regina 
Qu’Appelle Health Authority? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, as the member knows and as 
many people in the province know, recruiting of new people to 
work in our system as well as retaining the ones that are there 
are major priorities of the government. 
 
In Regina they have been working at recruiting through the 
Regina Qu’Appelle Health Authority with a special person 
hired to do this job. And I think many people will remember the 
ads in the newspaper last year where they lined up a lot of the 
people that they had recruited to come to the province. 
 
There are from time to time shortages in specific areas, and in 
the urologist area there are some challenges that they are 
attempting to address right now. I know that they’re working on 
this because we’ve identified it, the public’s identified it, and 
it’s something they’re working on. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, patients in Saskatchewan are 
supposed to have equal access to health services. It is 
incumbent on the Department of Health to ensure that adequate 
specialists are in place to deal with the volume of cases in the 
system. People like Stan Szostak should not be waiting three to 
four months for prostate cancer treatment. 
 
A recent CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) television 
story reported that some men wait a year and a half for this 
treatment. This is clearly not acceptable, Mr. Speaker. The 
minister himself has stated that the target for cancer treatment is 
to have 95 per cent of the cases treated within three weeks. 
 
Why has the Department of Health allowed the number of 
urologists in Regina to drop to such a crisis proportion when 
this issue has not happened overnight. It’s the responsibility of 
the minister to take action in a concrete way. 
 



May 28, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1279 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I think the people of 
Saskatchewan decided last fall that our government was the one 
that was going to proceed and deal with health issues and many 
other issues in this province because we set forward a plan in 
December, 2001 about how we were going to provide health 
care for people in Saskatchewan. And as we work forward we 
have to do a number of different things to deal with the supply 
of physicians and all of the other valuable health professionals. 
 
We have to provide training for them; we have to provide the 
proper compensation for them. We have to work together with 
all of the regional health authorities in the province to provide 
the appropriate work spaces. 
 
We’ve been doing those things and there are many people who 
are working now in our system. But from time to time we do 
have shortages in particular areas of the province and for 
particular physicians. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, it’s clear the surgery wait for 
prostate cancer is much shorter in Saskatoon than in Regina. 
Only 5 per cent of the people receive timely treatment in 
Regina; 95 per cent do not. If the goal is three weeks for 
treatment then we should be doing whatever we can to achieve 
that goal even if it means sending patients from Regina to 
Saskatoon, or sending them out-of-province if timely treatment 
is not available in Saskatchewan. These people should not be 
allowed to wait in fear of their future health concerns in this 
province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why aren’t the quality care coordinators directing 
clients who complain about waiting times to seek treatment in 
Saskatoon instead of telling people like Stan Szostak that they 
are lucky because others are waiting six months or longer. This 
is simply not acceptable, Mr. Speaker. 
 
What measures is the Department of Health taking to ensure 
that patients are informed about treatment alternatives in other 
locations in and out of this province if they can’t be dealt with 
in a timely fashion in Regina? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Traditionally in our system here in 
Saskatchewan and in Canada the family practitioners have been 
the main advocates for patients, and they do that kind of work. 
One of the things that’s happened though with the proliferation 
of information across the system is that people take much more 
interest and care in working with their own health problems. 
 
We’re trying to do that in Saskatchewan by providing 
information to the physicians, providing information to the 
patients about how the system works and we think that’s an 
important way to tackle this problem. 
 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, the minister says that the 
system relies on family resources and family physicians in order 
to make this system work. Mr. Speaker, outgoing Saskatchewan 
Medical Association president, Dr. Joel Yelland, says that this 
government needs to have a proper plan in place to address the 
issue of the shortage of doctors. He says that it’s time that 
Saskatchewan had a physician resource plan in place. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the minister relies on all these bureaucratic 
announcements that he makes. And at the same time that all 
these announcements are being made people like Stan Szostak 
are waiting in fear of the future of their health conditions 
because they’re exceeding the targets that are set by the medical 
system and even this very government. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when will this minister take responsibility for the 
people of Saskatchewan to have timely health care received, 
especially in oncology issues of cancer in this province, and if 
you can’t have it happen in Regina to see to it that there’s 
coordination between Regina and Saskatoon and 
out-of-province referrals? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(10:45) 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, in Saskatchewan, we have 
more doctors this last year than we did the previous year or the 
year before that. Each year, we’ve been increasing the number 
of physicians in our province. We are doing that in a very 
careful way. We’ve been working with the SMA (Saskatchewan 
Medical Association). We’ve been working with the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons. We’ve been working with our 
medical school and that is part of our plan. 
 
But one of the things that we have to do is make sure that we 
have the proper resources to do this across the whole system. 
And we are also working on that particular issue and that’s why 
we brought forward the budget we did this year for $173 
million. 
 
Mr. Speaker, one of the major problems in this province is how 
the members opposite seem to want to go at cross purposes of 
what the people of this province want to do. And I think, Mr. 
Speaker, that we need those people to work together with us as 
we move forward to build a health system which will provide 
good care for all Saskatchewan people. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!
