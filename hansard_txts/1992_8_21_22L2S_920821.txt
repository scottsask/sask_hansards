 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 2871 

 August 21, 1992 

 

The Assembly met at 2 p.m. 

 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 

 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I have a single kind 

of petition with about a thousand names attached to it.  And it 

is: 

 

 That in the 1991 general election, the voters of the province 

voted 62.62% to prevent the Government of Saskatchewan 

from paying for abortion procedures; 

 

 and that this margin far exceeds the support of any political 

party represented in the Legislature . . . 

 

And then I'll just read the prayer itself: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 

Honourable Assembly may be pleased to stop the funding of 

abortions in Saskatchewan. 

 

It gives me pleasure at this time, Mr. Speaker, to table these on 

behalf of the citizens across the province. 

 

READING AND RECEIVING PETITIONS 

 

Deputy Clerk: -- According to order, the following petitions 

have been reviewed, and pursuant to rule 11(7), they are hereby 

read and received: 

 

 Of citizens of the province of Saskatchewan humbly praying 

that your Honourable Assembly may be pleased to cause the 

government to restore the FeedGAP program. 

 

 Of citizens of the province of Saskatchewan humbly praying 

that your Honourable Assembly may be pleased to cause the

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Mr. Renaud: -- Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce to you 

and through you to the Assembly, some leaders of the 

Saskatchewan Young New Democrats from Kelsey-Tisdale 

constituency who are visiting the legislature today: Crystal 

Maslin of Archerwill, and Karri Hoffus of Bjorkdale, and I 

would ask that you all join with me in welcoming them here 

today -- grade 11 students who are indeed very keen in 

community, provincial, national, international affairs, Mr. 

Speaker.  Thank you. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

ORAL QUESTIONS 

 

Changes to GRIP 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Minister, after 

today . . . I have a question, Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of 

Agriculture.  Mr. Minister, after today we will have a new law 

in Saskatchewan, a law written and forced onto the people by 

you. 

 

The Queen's Bench ruled farmers had a prima facie case of 

breach of contract against the government.  You appealed this 

decision.  You were opposed to farmers being heard in court 

back in May, and you are effectively extinguishing that right 

with this new law.  Mr. Minister, we have a new law in 

Saskatchewan, but where is the justice? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the provisions that have been 

addressed in the Act that will be voted on hopefully later on 

today, will provide for the implementation of the 1992 GRIP 

(gross revenue insurance program) program and the 

clarification of program detail that was not clarified earlier, and 

some other provisions that void the requirement for notice 

because of the design that was there before.  And the legal 

provisions of the court still are accessible by farmers and 

people that want to address the matter through the courts. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, Mr. Minister, the government 

asked the court to have the farmers put up over $700,000 as a 

bond in case they lost.  You knew 700,000 was more than the 

farmers could afford.  You knew, but you asked that the 

farmers be forced to put it up.  Mr. Minister, you got your way.  

We have a new law.  And my question to you: where is the 

justice? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the member opposite talks 

about a $700,000 requirement.  There is no such provision.  It 

is common in applications for injunctions that it is asked that 

money be set aside in the event that expenses are incurred in 

the process of the injunction being in place should the court 

case find out differently than the results of the injunction. 



2872 Saskatchewan Hansard August 21, 1992 

That was requested of the court and it was not provided and it 

was never asked for in any particular amount.  The example of 

another case where $700,000 was given was used in example 

of a parallel case for the provision in the injunction. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, Mr. Minister, justice is not being 

served.  You are not allowing it to the court therefore justice is 

not being served in the courts and it certainly is not being 

served in this legislature. 

 

Mr. Minister, your government has used closure four times in 

an effort to ram through Bill 87, through the Assembly, to 

make it a law.  Four times you have restricted and limited the 

opposition's right to speak out against this Bill. 

 

Mr. Minister, we have a new law, and again I ask you the 

question, where the is the justice? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the justice system continues 

to be available to people wishing to address this matter through 

the courts.  The . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Order. 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- There is, within the Act as provided, a 

restriction on legal actions resulting from matters with respect 

to the notice.  The requirement for notice is voided with respect 

to changes in the program because there's an inconsistency 

between the provisions of the federal-provincial agreement and 

the requirement for a specific notice. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Minister, your 

government imposed time allocation on this Assembly in order 

to ram this legislation through.  The opposition faced time 

allocation and closure a total of four times, Mr. Minister.  The 

member from Moose Jaw Wakamow said he would not stand 

in a House as a back-bencher and . . . Mr. Minister, I don't 

believe he's ever voted on that allocation on time closure. 

 

Mr. Minister, you muzzled the government to get your mistake 

through this Assembly.  I ask you again, Mr. Minister, you 

have a new law but where is the justice? 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the provisions for dealing 

with matters in the House are matters of procedure which have 

properly been followed as far as I understand.  We attempted to 

introduce the Bill on June 10.  We wanted to give the full 

opportunity for the discussion of that Bill.  I think it would be 

accurate that in everybody's mind we've had an adequate time 

to discuss this Bill. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Minister, you asked this 

Assembly through rule changes to change the 

rules so that you could run this Bill through this Assembly 

without any interference.  And that, Mr. Minister, is a fact.  Led 

on by the member from P.A. (Prince Albert) Carleton. 

 

Mr. Minister, again you have a new law imposed on the 

province of Saskatchewan and again I ask you, where is the 

justice? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the procedures in the House 

are matters that are dealt with by House leaders.  The member 

opposite I think is aware that those matters have been discussed 

as time has gone on.  And I repeat that I attempted to introduce 

the Bill on June 10.  There has been a substantial time both for 

public discussion and discussion of the House.  And I think 

everyone believes that there has been adequate discussion of 

this Bill. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Minister, in our questions yesterday and 

today you have stood here as long as 35 minutes answering a 

question -- 35 minutes answering a question.  You're 

filibustering in our time allocation on this one, even.  You have 

not even attempted to answer our questions on this Bill. 

 

We ask you the question on why, why, why.  You don't answer 

the question.  You're attempting to run out the clock on this 

time allocation.  You are talking out the clock and making our 

time irrelevant. 

 

Mr. Minister, I repeat to you, you have a new law, sir, but 

where is the justice? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, I gave an answer to a 

question twice this morning.  I resisted giving it twice 

afterwards because it was asked again.  And I was asked to 

give the answer a third time.  I have been attempting to stay 

away from repeating answers, unless they've been repetitively 

asked.  I think I have been asked the same question on a variety 

of different areas at least 10 times.  And if the same questions 

are asked repeatedly, I believe that the answers are being 

sought, but I will attempt to restrict the length of my answers 

and maybe remind the members opposite when they are 

repeating a question that's been previously asked. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Minister, you used the rules of this 

Assembly; you changed the rules in the middle of the ball 

game, you changed it; you applied time allocation, closure; you 

used your overwhelming majority to deliver it.  All of you have 

a new law now, Mr. Minister, and where is the justice in that? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind the 

members opposite -- without repeating the whole history of the 

process -- that the review process through which the new 

program which is being implemented in this 



August 21, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 2873 

legislation was recommended, was a review process that grew 

out of the legislation passed by the members opposite last year.  

It was brought forward by a committee for the most part 

established by the members opposite last year. 

 

The process was followed and delivered their report to the 

minister on time lines determined in the legislation passed by 

the members opposite last year.  And the legislation reflects 

closely the recommendations made by the committee, and I 

think it respects the result of the consultations that the 

committee had with the public.  I think that's the kind of 

methodology that people want to see in the creation of 

government policy. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Minister, the member 

from Elphinstone said in a news comment that he believed that 

the incident that had occurred as to the lack of the time to 

deliver the message to the farmers of the province of 

Saskatchewan after March 15 when it was supposed to be 

delivered before March 15, Mr. Minister . . .  

 

Your mistake forced a change in the law, infringing on the 

rights of individuals in the province of Saskatchewan.  Your 

mistake of not notifying the farmers of changes to their 

contract before March 15, 1992 is the reason the law is being 

changed.  Because of your mistake, we have a new law, Mr. 

Minister, a new law taking away the rights of individuals 

before the court.  Where is the justice? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, I have answered this 

question a number of times in the committee proceedings.  The 

reality is that because of the fact that last year the program was 

not defined in legislation and because of the process by which 

information was distributed, there was an inability to determine 

what the relationship was between the government and farmers. 

 

This legislation provides that the legislation is . . . that last 

year's program is defined.  Because of the difficulties that have 

arisen because of the inadequate definition in law last year, we 

have provided the voiding of the notice provision, and as well 

because it's inconsistent with the federal-provincial agreement. 

 

And I could give a longer explanation, but I don't want to take 

up the valuable time of the members opposite. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Minister, you said, in questioning you 

yesterday, that there were three cases before the courts in 

determination and you were allowing them to go ahead in 

relation to the whole proceeding of GRIP '91. 

 

And my question to you, Mr. Minister: why don't you allow it 

to challenge you to keep that program in place and allow the 

courts to decide?  But today you sit in a legislature here 

controlled by 55 people and you say this is the law to the 

people of Saskatchewan.  And I'm asking you, sir, where is the 

justice in that? 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the members opposite have 

repeatedly made the contention that the March 15 deadline 

ought to be respected.  Inasmuch as it was possible to make the 

announcement with respect to the program last spring, we 

made the announcements on March 13.  The farmers have been 

given the information with respect to the program.  And there 

is an inconsistency in the request by the members opposite to 

go back to another program design when the program design 

that is in place was announced prior to March 13 and has been 

the basis of farmers farming.  So we can't have it both ways.  

We can't respect the March 15 deadline and at the same time 

suggest changes on August 20. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, all of Saskatchewan has . . . and, 

Mr. Minister, all of Saskatchewan has witnessed your 

government allow specific groups in the province to have a 

preliminary look at legislation.  I refer to the labour . . . and the 

proposed legislation affecting unions.  We can go to the 

environmental Bill.  Saskatchewan farmers were refused this 

same right by your government and were denied a preliminary 

look at the GRIP legislation.  Why, Mr. Minister?  Because 

you'd have had a revolt.  You'd have had a revolt because we 

have farmers all over the province contacting us and saying this 

is no good.  This is no good.  We have a new law, Mr. 

Minister, but we want to know where is the justice. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, I believe it's the tradition of 

the legislature that the rights of legislators are normally 

respected by having them be the first ones that see proposed 

legislation.  We attempted to share the legislation with the 

members opposite on June 10.  They didn't want to see it then, 

but it's here now and it's been fully discussed and I think 

everyone knows what's in the legislation. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, as I speak today, the Premier is 

in Ottawa negotiating a new constitution based on compromise 

and consensus.  He is defending and protecting Saskatchewan's 

rights under the constitution and the charter.  This is where the 

charter is.  It says: 

 

 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the 

person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in 

accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. 

 

Mr. Minister, we have a question for you.  You have a new 

law.  Why don't you put it to a challenge before the court?  

Why don't you put it as a reference to the Appeal court and to 

the Supreme Court.  Allow the people to have room to move.  

We have a new law, sir, but where is the justice in this? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 



2874 Saskatchewan Hansard August 21, 1992 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the Attorney General is 

responsible for making references . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Order, order.  The member from Wilkie has 

been interrupting at least, I don't know, 10 or 12 times so far in 

question period this afternoon.  I ask him please not to interrupt 

when the minister is speaking. 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- The Attorney General is responsible for 

making a judgement about the constitutionality of legislation.  

It's inappropriate for the Attorney General to refer matters to 

the courts in cases where there is no doubt about the 

constitutionality. 

 

The Attorney General . . . We have an opinion from both a 

senior law firm and from the Department of Justice that says 

this Bill is constitutional, and it is in that that the rights in law 

of people in Canada are protected. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. 

Speaker, I have but one question and it is to the Minister of 

Agriculture, and it's in response to the answer that he has just 

given. 

 

I would like to quote a little bit . . . it may be a little bit lengthy.  

I only have one question.  I just want to make this point, Mr. 

Minister of Agriculture.  This quote that I'm going to be 

making comes from the Legislative Counsel and Law Clerk of 

this Assembly.  And I'm going to quote a letter that Mr. Grant 

Devine -- I'm quoting the Leader of the Opposition -- got in our 

response to his interpretation to your legislation, Mr. Minister. 

 

This is what he says: 

 

 . . . in my opinion, these provisions, specifically Clauses 8 . . 

. and 18 . . . are contrary to the guaranteed legal rights which 

Canadians are "not to be deprived of except in accordance 

with the principles of fundamental justice" . . . 

 

 Mine is but a single opinion (he says).  Others (exist) . . . 

 

 All of these positions are reasonable.  Which one is the right 

one, is subject to interpretation.  I submit that the final 

authority making such an interpretation is the Supreme Court 

of Canada.  Access to the Supreme Court of Canada is costly 

and time-consuming . . . 

 

And then he goes: 

 

 There exists in Saskatchewan . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Order, order.  Order.  Order.  Next question, 

next question, next question. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- You won't take this Bill to the Court of 

Appeal, Mr. Minister, because you say you have a legal 

opinion that says the Bill is constitutional.  Mr. Minister, I have 

another legal opinion.  The legal counsel for this Legislative 

Assembly suggests that this Bill is not constitutional.  And we 

asked for that opinion, and we got 

it.  And, Mr. Minister, will you now commit to this Assembly 

that you will not send this Bill to the Court of Appeal for the 

reference? 

 

We have a new law in the province of Saskatchewan.  My 

question to you is, do we have justice? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, I'm not aware of the 

document the members opposite are reading.  I am aware that 

in Canada all people have access to the courts for clarification 

of the law.  And they should access it if they feel they have a 

concern in that regard. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  I direct 

the question to the member from Rosetown, the Minister of 

Agriculture.  I have here a short quote that says: 

 

 There exists in Saskatchewan a "Constitutional Questions 

Act" . . . which may be utilized by the Lieutenant Governor 

in Council to speedily take the issue "on reference" to the 

Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, which, in turn, establishes 

direct access to the Supreme Court of Canada. 

 

The quote concludes: 

 

  . . . I should think that this issue would be a proper one for 

such a reference. 

 

That, sir, is a constitutional expert from the Legislative 

Assembly from the province of Saskatchewan making that 

recommendation to you, sir.  Now I ask you: will you honour 

that kind of a commitment so that indeed there is justice in 

Saskatchewan for all people? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Chairman, we have an opinion from 

the Department of Justice and in an opinion from the firm of 

MacPherson Leslie & Tyerman that describes this as 

constitutional and under those circumstances the Attorney 

General would not be forwarding it to the courts. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Minister, Mr. Speaker: 

 

 Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of the 

person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in 

accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. 

 

And, Mr. Minister, we have not had the principles of 

fundamental justice followed in this Assembly for the past six 

months.  And it's based on the mistake that you have made, sir, 

in not having . . . As the member from Elphinstone said, it was 

your mistake, your blunder, sir.  And we are asking you this 

question:  are you above the law?  And when are we going to 

have justice for the people of the province of Saskatchewan? 



August 21, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 2875 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, I would remind the members 

opposite that the provisions within the Act have substantially 

been necessitated by careless construction last year of a 

program, by non-definition of the relationship between farmers 

and the Government of Saskatchewan. While the crop 

insurance contract has repeatedly been defined in legislation, 

the revenue insurance contract was not.  Farmers could have 

believed that the contractual obligation between them and the 

province was any number of things that could have been 

defined by a crop insurance agent speaking to them, by 

members of the cabinet of the previous government speaking to 

them.  The description of the program, later called a contract, 

was not mailed out in pamphlet form until May 1.  There is no 

definition of the program.  The federal-provincial agreement on 

which the program was based was not passed until September . 

. . 

 

The Speaker: -- Next question. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, I want to table the letter that we 

asked for from the Law Clerk of the Assembly, and I want to 

read into the record, equality of rights, Mr. Minister: 

 

 Every individual is equal before and under the law and has 

the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law. 

 

It's in the charter of rights.  You should maybe read it some day 

for yourself as a quiet time so you understand what's going on. 

 

Mr. Minister, the Premier . . . I'm going to ask you again.  The 

Premier in the province of Saskatchewan is today discussing 

constitutional rights as it relates to aboriginals, as it relates to 

other people in the province of Saskatchewan.  That is based on 

consensus and compromise.  We are asking you . . .  You have 

a new law, and we are asking you, where is the justice for the 

farmers in the province of Saskatchewan? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the farmers and all other 

people in the province continue to have access to the courts, 

who will determine the legal matters before them, both with 

respect to this program and this law. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Minister, you have Department of Justice 

pay for people to provide their defences in a program that's 

called legal aid.  You have that across the province for those 

people that can't pay.  And my question to you today is why do 

you not allow this to go to the Appeal court with a reference to 

the Supreme Court so that you can have the freedom to go 

around this province and defend the farmers for the first time?  

We have a new law, Mr. Minister, but where is the justice for 

the farmers in the province of Saskatchewan? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, the concerns the member 

opposite raises have to do with the question of notice with 

respect to program delivery.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of such 

notice, the purpose of such notice is so that farmers can be 

given program information, have time to understand it, and 

have time to respond to program options.  The program 

announcements were made as early as possible this year -- on 

March 13.  Further information was forwarded through other 

literature and through direct contact with agents of the Crop 

Insurance Corporation.  And farmers have had full time to 

understand and respond to the program. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 

 

New Funding Arrangement for Physician Services in 

Turtleford 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: -- Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform this 

Assembly of an exciting pilot project which is currently 

underway in the Turtleford area.  This two-year pilot project 

will test a new funding arrangement for physician services. 

 

Under the trial agreement, the province will provide Riverside 

Memorial Union Hospital Board with funding for physicians' 

services based on the number of residents in the area served by 

the board.  The hospital board currently manages the special 

care home hospital and medical clinic.  Over the next two years 

the board will use the money to pay the salaries of two 

full-time physicians to provide services in the community. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to report that Turtleford has already 

hired one physician and is in the process of completing 

negotiations with a second. 

 

I believe the type of arrangement which is being tested in the 

Turtleford area may appeal to many physicians because 

reimbursement will not be tied to performing services 

identified on the fee-for-service payment schedule.  Physicians 

will have more flexibility in their practices.  This will allow 

them to spend more time with patients, providing counselling 

and health education information for example. 

 

(1430) 

 

The pilot arrangement also allows physicians to make life-style 

choices.  They can reduce the number of long hours they're 

required to work while maintaining an attractive income.  In 

addition to benefitting physicians, the Turtleford pilot project 

also has advantages for the Riverside Memorial Union Hospital 

Board. 

 

The agreement is also expected to give the board greater 

flexibility in managing its budgets for the community's three 

health facilities, allowing it to allocate its resources to best 

meet the needs of Turtleford and area residents.  If it results in 

any changes in utilization of physician services, any surplus 

funds could be used for new programs which support and 

promote wellness or for expanded community-based services. 



2876 Saskatchewan Hansard August 21, 1992 

Mr. Speaker, this initiative was taken by the Turtleford area.  

And both the College of Physician and Surgeons and the 

Saskatchewan Medical Association support studying 

alternatives to the traditional fee-for-service approach. 

 

Thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I'm not quite sure 

how to react to a statement like this at a time when I think that 

most people in Saskatchewan are very sceptical of the minister.  

And certainly any announcement made in this Assembly right 

now are going to be met with a great deal of scepticism from 

this side as you try to divert attention from one fiasco and 

another and another and another. 

 

I am pleased to hear that you are saying here that the College of 

Physicians and Surgeons and the SMA (Saskatchewan Medical 

Association) support studying alternatives and so on and so 

forth.  But even there, Madam Minister, I am sceptical.  

Because we have heard too many of your announcements 

where at the initial first blush it seems as if everyone is 

supporting you, and yet when the floodgates open and someone 

starts to question we find out that there are a whole host of 

questions with many of your initiatives that people would want 

to get answers to. 

 

So I say, Madam Minister, although I would commend 

Turtleford for the kind of initiative as shown by them in this 

particular instance, I am not about to fall in line and give you 

too many accolades at this time until we've had a full 

opportunity to research this matter along with many other 

initiatives that you have taken. 

 

ORDERS OF THE DAY 

 

The Speaker: -- Pursuant to a special order of the legislature, 

the legislature will now convene into a Committee of the 

Whole under Bill No. 87, An Act respecting amendments to 

Certain Farm Income Insurance Legislation.  I therefore leave 

the Chair. 

 

SPECIAL ORDER 

 

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

 

Bill No. 87 -- An Act respecting amendments to Certain 

Farm Income Insurance Legislation 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, Mr. 

Minister, from the outset of the last few days, we've been 

asking the minister to please consider on behalf of farmers of 

Saskatchewan, please consider the option that the farmers 

should have to take and have their day in court heard.  Mr. 

Minister, you've said to us in questioning that you have legal 

opinion that suggests that, and the Minister of Justice suggests, 

that the legislation you've put forward, Bill No. 87, is 

constitutional. 

 

Mr. Minister, that's exactly what it is -- it's legal opinion. 

And today, Mr. Minister, we sought -- the opposition party 

sought -- legal counsel from none other than the legal counsel 

to the legislature here, Mr. R.D. Cosman.  Mr. Minister, you 

have legal opinion, we have legal opinion.  There's all kinds of 

opinions around on this subject.  And yet, Mr. Minister, you 

don't seem to want to recognize the fact there may be people in 

this province and indeed in this country that disagree with you. 

 

Mr. Minister, I want to read this letter that we received from 

Mr. Cosman on the question of this Bill.  We sought legal 

opinion from him and I think it's important that this letter be 

read into the record, and I'll do so now. 

 

 I have carefully reviewed the provisions of Bill 87 with 

respect to the extinguishment of causes of action and the 

institution or continuation of such actions before the courts, 

and, in my opinion, these provisions -- specifically Clauses 8 

. . . and 18 . . . are contrary to the legal rights which 

Canadians are "not to be deprived thereof except in 

accordance with the principles of fundamental justice" (s. 7 

of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms) unless such 

rights are limited "by law as can be demonstrably justified in 

a free and democratic society" (s. 1 of the Canadian Charter 

of Rights and Freedoms). 

 

 Mine is but a single opinion.  Others could be of the opinion 

that access to the courts is not specifically guaranteed by 

section 7 of the Charter (although there is case law to the 

contrary -- Pearlman v. Manitoba Law Society Judicial 

Committee (1991) . . . Still others would argue that, although 

a legal right has been "limited", it is "demonstrably justified" 

by the Preamble to the Bill ("Whereas" Clauses), and 

therefore is allowed by section 1 of the Charter. 

 

 All of these positions are reasonable.  Which one is . . . right . 

. . is subject to interpretation.  I submit that the final authority 

in making such an interpretation is the Supreme Court of 

Canada.  Access to the Supreme Court is costly and 

time-consuming (1-2 years, optimistically -- and then not "as 

of right") when taken on appeal from actions which are not 

yet before the courts or at currently at the trial . . . (referring 

to the appeal) level.  There exists in Saskatchewan a 

"Constitutional Questions Act" . . . which may be utilized by 

the Lieutenant Governor in Council to speedily take the issue 

"on reference" to the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, 

which, in turn, establishes direct access to the Supreme Court 

of Canada. 

 

 As an element of doubt may exist in the legal community at 

large (although none exists in my mind), and as this is a 

matter begging early resolution -- being a matter of concern 

to a significant number of crop insurance contractors as well 

as the Government of Saskatchewan -- I should think that this 

issue would be a proper one for such a reference.  

Respectfully submitted, R.D. Cosman, Legislative Counsel 

and Law Clerk. 



August 21, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 2877 

Mr. Minister, legal opinion from this very institution, legal 

opinion from this very institution says that this should go to . . . 

a reference to the Court of Appeal. 

 

You have on your staff paid employees, and you have some of 

them with you today, that suggests maybe the government is 

right.  And yet, Mr. Minister, legal opinion on the other side, 

not paid for by any one other than the Saskatchewan taxpayer, 

suggests that this is exactly the kind of case that should go 

before a Court of Appeal for a reference and on to the Supreme 

Court.  And yet, Mr. Minister, you don't seem fit to do that.  

And one can only ask, but why?  Why in Saskatchewan when 

there is one legal opinion that you have and there's another 

legal opinion that others have, none other than an independent 

Law Clerk from this very institution, from this very institution, 

Mr. Minister.  And yet you won't allow the farmers of 

Saskatchewan to have their right to court. 

 

Mr. Minister, it seems absolutely unbelievable in a free and 

democratic society that when we have legal opinions on one 

side and legal opinions on the other side on such a basic 

principle of law, the right to court action, that we all in Canada 

think we should have the right to, that you don't want to go 

ahead with that. 

 

What is your motive behind not allowing farmers their right in 

court?  What makes you believe that you are so right in the face 

of so much evidence that points that you may be wrong.  We 

are not saying you are guaranteed to be wrong.  We are saying 

that there are others like Mr. Cosman that believes that maybe 

you are wrong; maybe, sir, your legal opinion is not correct.  

And that is why in Canada we have a Supreme Court to decide 

once and for all for everyone to see who is indeed correct. 

 

And yet the minister steadfastly stands by his position that no, 

we're not going to take it to the Court of Appeal or not going to 

take it to the Supreme Court.  And I think the only reason is is 

because his counsel, legal counsel, has suggested to him that 

he's going to lose.  He's going to lose. 

 

(1445) 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Why doesn't he table those? 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- And my colleague makes a good point.  It would 

be interesting, Mr. Minister, it would be interesting, and I think 

it's something that the opposition will demand and we demand 

now, that you table those legal opinions that you have. 

 

You've told us all day long and all day yesterday that you have 

legal opinion that suggests that you're correct.  Well, Mr. 

Minister, as of August 21 today, we have legal opinion that 

suggests you are not right.  And we've tabled it.  We've tabled 

it for all to see.  And the media has copies of it, and everyone 

else in this province.  And hopefully before very long, every 

farmer in this province will have a copy of this document that 

suggests you are incorrect. 

 

Mr. Minister, the honourable thing, the honourable thing as I 

see it to do, would be for you to suggest that this . . . to the 

Minister of Justice that this action goes forward.  That this 

action goes forward and we decide once and for all in 

a court of law, the Supreme Court of Canada, if indeed your 

actions and your Bill are legitimate and legal. 

 

Mr. Minister, it's surely a sorry state of affairs in a great 

country like Canada and a great province like Saskatchewan 

when one man, when one man surrounded by a few 

individuals, a few individuals, can decide for themselves, 

absolutely decide for themselves unilaterally that they are 

above the law.  They are above the law. 

 

They don't believe in the face of overwhelming evidence that 

they might not be correct.  Beyond a shadow of a doubt they 

believe they are correct and everybody else out there, all the 

rest of legal opinion in Saskatchewan, is wrong.  And yet Mr. 

Cosman suggests, as "an element of doubt may exist in the 

legal community at large, although none exists in my mind" -- 

he suggests that everybody else is wrong and I'm right. 

 

Well, Mr. Minister, why not take up the challenge?  Why not 

put your case to the courts?  Why not find out for all of us, 

prove to the people of Saskatchewan, your legal opinion and 

your actions to date have been correct? 

 

Mr. Minister, it's little wonder the editorials are so harsh 

against your actions.  They are suggesting as soon as this 

session is over that your political star will be extinguished 

along with the rights of the farmers of this province.  That's 

what the collective editorials of the last little while have been. 

 

The member from Rosetown-Elrose rose like a phoenix into the 

sky and shed light for all of us to see with.  He was going to be 

the be-all and end-all and fix agriculture in this province for 

once and for all.  But, Mr. Speaker, his star is diminishing.  It's 

dropping like a falling star.  We've all seen him shoot through 

the sky, and his star is diminishing just as rapidly as that light 

flickers out for the . . . 

 

An Hon. Member: -- That's too bad, one mistake. 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Exactly.  My colleague says and it's too bad.  One 

mistake.  That's all it took, Berny. 

 

The Chair: -- Order.  The member should know better than to 

refer to other members by their name. 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Mr. Chairman, you're indeed correct.  I apologize 

for that slip of the tongue.  All it took, Mr. Minister, Mr. 

Member from Rosetown-Elrose, was one mistake.  That's all it 

took, and your career has been extinguished exactly the same 

way you've had to put legislation together to extinguish the 

rights of farmers -- exactly the same way. 

 

You've become, as all of the editorials are suggesting that we 

see now, a liability for the government.  All of us in politics, all 

of us in politics knows what happens to a liability.  You are 

dealt with and dealt with rather severely and quickly.  I would 

suggest that rather quickly after this session ends, which 

probably isn't going to be too much longer, rather quickly after 

this session ends, it will be completely extinguished.  If it isn't, 

Mr. Speaker, I think that the farmers of Saskatchewan will be 

sorely 



2878 Saskatchewan Hansard August 21, 1992 

disappointed. 

 

Mr. Minister, in conclusion the only right and honourable thing 

to do is to take this Bill and put it to the courts, put it to the 

Appeal court of Saskatchewan and on to the Supreme Court.  

And you, sir, have the power to do that.  You can push this 

through very, very quickly.  Let's put it to the test.  Let's put 

your legal opinion that you have . . . and we respect that.  We 

respect the legal opinions that you have.  We would like to see 

them tabled in this legislature.  We most certainly respect the 

legal opinion that we sought from none other than the 

Legislative Law Clerk for this institution.  We respect his 

opinion, just as we respect the opinion that you have.  But we 

believe the final opinion, the final judgement, the final 

judgement has to come down to the Supreme Court of Canada . 

. . from the Supreme Court of Canada. 

 

We have a law, we have a law before us . . . Mr. Minister, we 

appeal to you to give us justice.  Thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure what the 

question here is.  I have stated before and will state again, the 

Attorney General is the one who makes the judgement on the 

question of reference.  The Attorney General has an analysis 

and an opinion from the Department of Justice and from a 

senior law firm in the city that says they do not doubt the 

constitutionality of the Bill, and that continues to be the basis 

on which the judgement of the Attorney General is made. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. 

Minister, the Minister of Justice is helping to solidify the rights 

of individuals in this country with his participation in the 

constitutional affairs that are taking place.  But what we have 

in this province is a situation where the Premier's own 

Agriculture minister and his cabinet are taking away the rights 

of individuals in this province -- taking away the rights of 

individuals to go to court to seek redress for damage caused to 

them by the government and the government's legislation. 

 

Mr. Minister, farmers signed a contract along with the crop 

insurance agents who were administrating that contract, that 

paper.  They both signed it in good faith that that was indeed a 

contract.  You've stated in question period that because there 

was no legislation before this House, there was no contract.  

Are you telling us, Mr. Minister, that because there was no 

contract . . . no legislation, there was no contract?  Because 

there still is no legislation passed in this House, that there is 

today still no contract?  If that is the case, Mr. Minister, are 

farmers allowed today to withdraw from that supposedly 

non-contract without any penalties? 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I said -- and if 

I did, I would correct it -- I don't believe I have said that there 

was no contract.  What I have said is that there was no 

definition in law of what the contract was and therefore there 

could be 50,000 separate interpretations of what the contract is 

because the contractual obligation could have been seen to be a 

representation made by a cabinet minister at a meeting, a crop 

insurance agent meeting with the farmer, any number of 

communications 

that the farmer would believe were official on the part of 

government.  Because there was nothing in legislation that 

defines what that contract is, there could be as many 

interpretations of what that contract is as there are farmers in 

the province. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Mr. Minister, we're still not getting 

any answers from you.  We've gone on all morning, all day 

yesterday, with no real answers.  We get a lot of gum-flapping 

but no answers.  You talked for 35 minutes before noon hour 

and said nothing.  Mr. Chairman, because we cannot get any 

answers from the minister, we're prepared to complete the 

reading of clause 1.

Clause 7 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have an 

amendment to make to this clause.  It takes out some of 



2880 Saskatchewan Hansard August 21, 1992 

the deeming that is going on in this piece of legislation and it 

grandfathers the GRIP legislation or the GRIP contracts as they 

were before.  I'd like to read the amendment: 

 

 Clause 7 of the printed Bill is amended by deleting section 

5.1 as being enacted therein and substituting the following 

therefor: 

 

  "5.1 Every revenue insurance contract that was not 

terminated by the producer on or before March 31, 1992, 

is hereby continued, and the corporation shall honour all 

terms and conditions set out in that contract." 

 

I so move. Mr. Chairman. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Chairman, the reason why we're bringing 

this amendment is to take out the items that the minister put in 

that voids the terms and conditions and sets it out so that he can 

make the regulations to do exactly as he says.  And, Mr. 

Chairman, and to the members of this Assembly, those terms 

and conditions as prescribed in regulation, we want them, as set 

out in the original contract, to deal with the kinds of things that 

we know that the farmers of the province of Saskatchewan 

have grown accustomed to, and those terms and conditions 

under the contract as they are set out in relation to the forms 

that were sent out, in the information that was provided, we 

want the terms and conditions to be exactly as they have been 

set out. 

 

We want them to be honoured.  Because of the kinds of things 

that have been going on in this Assembly, we want that ensured 

in this Bill, that they will be honoured.  The terms and 

conditions can be set out in this Bill, under regulations, to alter 

or expand or contract, do whatever the minister wants to have, 

or the executive branch of government. 

 

And therefore we on this side of the House want to have that 

opportunity registered, that the contract that the farmers know 

is theirs, to be in fact the truth, and that the corporation shall 

honour all of those contracts.  And we want the minister and 

this Assembly to deal with that on that basis.

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Mr. Chairman, I have another 

amendment dealing with clause 7.  This one deals with the 

notifications of March 15.  This part of the Act would void the 

part of the contract that says a notice has to be given by March 

15.  We don't accept that, Mr. Chairman, and we would like to 

remove that part of the Bill. 

 

I move that we: 

 

 Amend clause 7 of the printed Bill by deleting section 5.4 as 

being enacted therein. 

 

I so move, Mr. Chairman. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The discussion in 

this Act has taken place around the involvement of March 15 of 

the contract, provision number . . . section 49, and we believe 

that this is what has seriously caused the problem for the 

minister.  We want to note that.  And for the people of the 

province of Saskatchewan we want them also to note that the 

minister is asking this Assembly to void all of the effects of the 

items that happened from January 1, 1991, until today so that 

the Minister of Agriculture can decide what happened on those 

days. 

 

And we say that the minister is wrong.  We think that he made 

the mistake.  He should, I believe, apologize to the 50,000 

contract holders in the province of Saskatchewan for the hassle 

he has put them through. 

 

And I think that we on this side of the House believe that this is 

fully in keeping with the intent of what the contract was in the 

original contract the farmers signed.  And therefore, Mr. 

Chairman, we will be supporting this amendment, to show the 

people of the province that the government and the province of 

Saskatchewan is overriding and overruling in a case when they 

should not, and allowing these incidents to be completely 

stricken from the record.

Clause 8 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have an 

amendment to this clause.  This amendment will strike out 

provisions barring farmers from the courts.  This clause of the 

Bill extinguishes individual and group rights.  It extinguishes 

actions already before the court, Mr. Chairman.  This clause 

even prevents the courts from considering principles of law or 

equity. 

 

The amendment I wish to present reads as follows: 

 

 Amend clause 8 of the printed Bill by striking out section 

10.1 as being enacted therein. 

 

I so move, Mr. Chairman. 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Chairman, I want to point out that this 

section says that: 

 

 No action or proceeding lies or shall be instituted or 

continued against the Crown or a Crown agent based on any 

cause of action arising from, resulting from or incidental to . . 

. 

 

And then it has a whole lot of conditions that exist under those 

. . . in that amendment: 

 

 any term, condition, warranty, contract, promise, inducement, 

enticement, representation or other understanding that is 

collateral to or modifies, varies, qualifies or amends in any 

way a revenue insurance contract or the combination of a 

revenue insurance contract and a contract of crop insurance . . 

. 

 

This, Mr. Speaker, and to the members of the Assembly, in my 

view is the part of the Bill that says that the issue before this 

Assembly reduces the rights of individuals in the process of . . . 

of due process in a court of law. 

 

I want to read into the record what I believe to be the 

fundamental right of a Canadian.  The Canadian charter of 

rights, as established by the Government of Canada for the 

people of Canada, says these are the legal rights of individuals: 

 

 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the 

person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in 

accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. 

 

That, I believe, is impaired by this part of the legislation. 

 

I also want to point out in the equality of rights that individual 

has . . . have: 

 

 Every individual is equal before and under the law and has 

the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law 

without discrimination and, in particular, without 

discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, 

colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. 

 

 Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity 

that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of 

disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are 

disadvantaged because of race . . . (nationality, creed,) 

colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability. 

 

And I would say, Mr. Minister, that in brackets we can put the 

farmers of the province of Saskatchewan.  Equality of rights, 

legal: 

 

 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security . . . except 

in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. 

 

And that, Mr. Minister, is being denied the people of the 

province of Saskatchewan.  Under the charter I believe you're 

wrong. 



2882 Saskatchewan Hansard August 21, 1992 

We have had the representation made at our request by the Law 

Clerk in the Assembly.  And he said: 

 

 I have carefully reviewed the provisions of Bill 87 with 

respect to the extinguishment of causes of action and the 

institution or continuation of such actions before the courts, 

and, in my opinion, these provisions -- specifically Clauses 8 

(enacting new sections 10.1 and 10.2 of The Agricultural 

Safety Net Act) and 18 (enacting new sections 13.1 and 13.2 

of The Crop Insurance Act) -- are contrary to the guaranteed 

legal rights which Canadians are "not to be deprived thereof 

except in accordance with the principles of fundamental 

justice" . . . unless such rights are limited "by law as can be 

demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society." 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, that's our contention, that we have in this 

Assembly breached the charter of rights in order to have this 

minister pursue his decision to limit access to the court by 

individuals in the province of Saskatchewan. 

 

I believe, Mr. Minister, that you will be recorded in history, 

that that is exactly what happened and that is exactly what the 

future references will be.  And I trust or I hope that you will 

understand the volume of disenchantment that people in the 

province have about what you're doing. 

 

My only hope is that you would some day realize this and 

provide an opportunity for this challenge to be made through 

the Court of Appeal with a reference by you and the Minister 

of Justice to the Court of Appeal and also to the Supreme Court 

of Canada. 

 

And I believe that we have in the province of Saskatchewan 

precedent established by that fact.  And I want to point out that 

the people in this province, when they made representation to 

this Assembly on the basis of reference to the court, were given 

that opportunity, to the Appeal court in a very tight time frame, 

in a very significant Bill.  And that was the one that dealt with 

the electoral boundaries a little over a year ago. 

 

And the Supreme Court made the ruling, and it made the ruling 

on the basis of this very same charter, Mr. Speaker, on this very 

same charter.  And it says here: 

 

 Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of 

members of the House of Commons or of a legislative 

assembly and to be qualified for membership therein. 

 

And, Mr. Chairman, the qualifications in this charter determine 

the constitutional validity of the electoral boundary changes 

that were made.  And this constitution, the charter of rights, has 

the same implication, I believe, in this case, as it relates to this 

section. 

 

And therefore, Mr. Minister, I urge all members of this 

Assembly to vote in favour of this amendment, to restore the 

opportunity of ordinary individuals to seek redress in a court of 

law.

Clause 9 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have an 

amendment to make to this clause.  The clause itself reads: 



August 21, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 2883 

 Section 11 is amended: 

 

 (a) by renumbering it as subsection (1); 

 

Mr. Chairman, I believe there's an error in the drafting of this 

Bill.  It's not being done properly.  It's the second time I've 

found this kind of an error in the government's drafting.  I 

would like to propose an amendment that says: 

 

 Amend clause 9 of the printed Bill by inserting the number 

"11" between the word "subsection" and the number "(1)" 

where they appear in subclause (a) thereof. 

 

I believe that these kind of changes should be done properly by 

the drafting department for the government, Mr. Speaker, Mr. 

Chairman. 

 

The Chair: -- It's my understanding that discussions are taking 

place with respect to the amendment, and I would inquire at 

this point if it's agreed to by members whether we can move to 

any other amendments on clause 9.  Is that agreed? 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Yes, I'd like to move an amendment to 

correct a drafting error in clause 9 of the Bill.  I move that we: 

 

 Amend clause 9 of the printed Bill by striking out the word 

"agreement" where it occurs in clause 11(e.6) as being 

enacted therein and substituting therefor the word "contract." 

 

The drafting error is an error because the word agreement in 

this Act is a defined term in the Act, referring to the 

federal-provincial GRIP agreement.  And the provision here 

needs to have a more general connotation.  The clause being 

amended, we intend the definition to be broader than the 

federal-provincial agreement which is defined in the Act.  

Therefore we're using a synonym, the word contract, to signify 

the broader meaning. 

 

The Chair: -- Can I just inquire, are there any other 

amendments that are proposed which should be inserted prior 

to the consideration of this amendment, other than the one 

that's been stood. 

 

(1615) 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Yes there is, Mr. Chairman. 

 

The Chair: -- To be inserted prior to the consideration of this 

amendment? 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- That is correct.  I believe the clause he is 

talking about is clause e.  Yes, Mr. Chairman, I have an 

amendment to propose prior to that. 

 

The Chair: -- Then I would ask that that amendment be 

considered first, and we'll put the minister's amendment on 

hold and ask the member for Souris-Cannington to move his 

amendment at this point. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Can we have a point of order, Mr. 

Speaker? 

The Chair: -- Point of order, yes. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- On (e.6) of . . . section 11(B) (e.6), is that 

what we're . . . section 11(B) (e.6).  Our amendment is section 

(C) . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Yes, yours has come first. 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Excuse me, I'm sorry for that.  Should I 

move it over again with that addition? 

 

Mr. Chairman, I moved in error or made an error in the original 

amendment.  The amendment I wish to move is to: 

 

 Amend clause 9 of the printed Bill by striking out the word 

"agreement" where it occurs in clause (B) (e.6) as being 

enacted therein and substituting therefor the word "contract". 

 

Amendment agreed to. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I have 

another amendment to make to this clause 9.  The section I 

wish to amend deals with the government making changes at a 

later date in the GRIP contract.  Changes may be made at any 

time.  But what happens under this section is that they are made 

retroactive to January 1, '91.  I believe that is wrong, Mr. 

Chairman, to allow that to happen. 

 

Farmers signed those contracts based on the information they 

had at the time of the signing, not something that the 

government may wish to stick in there at a later time. 

 

I will read the amendment, Mr. Chairman: 

 

 Amend clause 9 of the printed Bill by striking out subclause 

(c). 

 

I so move.

Clause 12 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have an 

amendment to propose on this clause.  I would like to read the 

original clause as presented in the Bill: 

 

 This Act comes into force on the day of assent but is 

retroactive and is deemed to have been in force on and from 

January 1, 1991. 

 

Mr. Chairman, because of closure and because of their arrogant 

majority of the government, this Bill will become law.  But 

there will be no justice.  The use of their massive majority to 

jam this through the legislature is arrogant, Mr. Chairman.  

You may have the right to put it through, but you have no 

moral right to make it retroactive to January 1, 1991. 

 

I will read the amendment, Mr. Chairman: 

 

 Amend clause 12 of the printed Bill by deleting Section 15 as 

being enacted therein and substituting the following therefor: 

 

 "15 This Act comes into force on the day of assent." 

 

I so move, Mr. Chairman.

Clause 18 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have an 

amendment to make to this clause.  This amendment will void 

the retroactivity of this Bill and maintain the date by which 

changes are to be made to any contracts. 

 

The GRIP forms which were signed by both parties were 

contracts.  When those parties signed it, they agreed that it was 

a contract.  This clause in the Bill removes the March 15 

deadline by claiming it never existed.  They are deeming it out 

of existence, Mr. Chairman, denying history. 

 

I would read the amendment, Mr. Chairman: 

 

 Amend clause 18 of the printed Bill: 

 

 (a) by deleting section 13.1 as being enacted therein; 

 

 (b) by renumbering section 13.2 as being enacted therein as 

section 13.1; 

 

 (c) by adding the word "or" after the words "a  

contract of crop insurance;" where they occur in clause (1)(b) 

of newly renumbered section 13.1 as being enacted therein; 

 

 (d) by deleting, in newly renumbered section 13.1, clause 

(1)(c) as being enacted therein; and 

 

 (e) by relettering, in newly renumbered section 13.1, clause 

(1)(d) as clause (1)(c). 

 

I so move, Mr. Chairman. 

 

(1645) 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to point 

out again in this section, as I did in the section earlier that dealt 

with extinguishing rights and notwithstanding and deeming, the 

word "deem" or "to deem" in legal terms is to consider it as 

legal fiction.  That's the definition of the word "deem" -- legal 

fiction. 

 

And I want to point out that the word "deem" is used in this 

part -- it's going to be deemed that nothing happened from 

January 1, 1991 to today.  And the Minister of Agriculture is 

going to make what happened in his mind what happened in the 

province of Saskatchewan. 

 

And I say that is really legal fiction, Mr. Minister.  And I 

would also say that he's going to, before he deems this legal 

fiction on the province of Saskatchewan, he's going to void all 

of the circumstances and the conditions and the terms and the 

contracts of all of the things that happened. 

 

And then in the second part of this section, he's going to 

extinguish the rights of individuals -- extinguish the rights in: 

 

 any term (or) condition, warranty, contract, promise, 

inducement, enticement, representation or other 

understanding that is collateral to or modifies, varies, 

qualifies or amends in any way a contract of a crop insurance 

(contract); 

 

That, Mr. Minister, is what you're going to do. 

 

And again, Mr. Minister, we lay this before this Assembly to 

have everyone note that the issue is that you cannot take away 

from the individuals in the province of Saskatchewan 

anywhere, at any time, the right before redress before the court.  

That's what we're talking about. 

 

The Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the province of 

Saskatchewan were put here by people who believed in the 

freedom of the individual and access to the court.  And it says, 

about legal rights: 

 

 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the 

person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in 

accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. 

 

Fundamental justice is carried out in a court of law.  And, Mr. 

Minister, you are extinguishing that right for individuals in the 

province of Saskatchewan. 



August 21, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 2887 

There are 50,000 contracts signed by individuals in the 

province of Saskatchewan, and you're going to deem legal 

fiction that they never were there.  That's what you're deeming.  

You're voiding it first, cleaning the slate, and deeming they 

never were there. 

 

That, Mr. Minister, is exactly what's happening.  And the 

charter of rights says the only time you can do that is if you 

allow the court to determine whether in fact you have the right 

to do that.  And, Mr. Minister, you are taking away that right to 

do that in this Assembly.  You are taking the right away from 

individuals to make an appeal to the court with an independent 

person hearing the case. 

 

You're taking that right away from the people of the province 

of Saskatchewan.  And that, Mr. Minister, is wrong.  It's wrong 

whether you do it here, whether you do it in Manitoba or 

Alberta -- any place in Canada.  And it's a fundamental right 

established by the Magna Carta in 1215.  That's when it started, 

Mr. Minister, that you have equality before the law and 

equality in making the law.  And that everybody has equality in 

making the law is being reduced here by this massive majority 

by the members opposite. 

 

And then you take that massive majority and crunch the 

farming community contracts into one and put it in the garbage 

and you say it never existed; it's void; nobody made one. 

 

And there are members sitting across as we view here, rural 

members who have their own contracts voided.  They're 

voided.  They signed them themselves and they're voided.  And 

now, sir, you are taking the right for anyone who disagrees 

with you, you're taking the right to appear in a court of law to 

deal with that. 

 

And you say that that's the fundamental right of a Canadian, 

that you have the right to dictate what that is.  I say no, sir.  

You should take and allow it to go to the appeal as a reference 

to the Appeal court of Saskatchewan for constitutional 

reference. 

 

And that, members of this Assembly, is what is needed in this 

instance.  And I want to point that out again.  It is necessary, as 

necessary yesterday in this Bill as it is today.  And it will be 

tomorrow after you pass it too.  And that's why we are standing 

here in our place and saying, no you can't take away the rights 

of individuals to access to the court. 

 

You don't have the courage.  You don't have the courage to 

stand in the court and testify to the things that you say in this 

House because you will have to swear with an oath that what 

you say is honest and truthful, and you don't have the courage 

to do that.  That's number one.  The Minister of Agriculture 

does not have the courage to do that. 

 

Number two, he doesn't have the courage to be tried by his 

peers in reference to it.  He doesn't have the courage to do that.  

And I say to this Assembly he is wrong yesterday about that, 

and he's wrong today. 

 

And that, Mr. Minister, and Mr. Chairman, is exactly what 

we're talking about here.  Everyone has the right to life, 

liberty, and security of the person and the right not to be 

deprived of that, except in one instance, and that's when the 

justice system places the emphasis and says you have gone to 

court and the court has proven that you're wrong or that you're 

right.  That's the only time you can take it away. 

 

And now we stand in this Assembly and we hear it said over 

and over again.  Every time you get up to vote, you say yes, I'm 

going to take it away from the people of the province of 

Saskatchewan.  And that's what's wrong with what you're 

doing.  And that's why we're voting no to this section.  And 

we're hoping that somebody has the positive attitude and 

enough sense over there to at least submit to some rule of 

authority, even if you haven't got any conscience on your own.  

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Clause 19 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move a House 

amendment to clause 19.  Another drafting error has occurred 

in the Bill.  I'd like to: 

 

 Amend clause 22 of the printed Bill by striking out the word 

"agreement" where it occurs in clause 22(1)(e) as being 

enacted therein and substituting therefor the word "contract". 

 

This is the same circumstance as happened in the previous 

amendment where the word agreement is a defined term in this 

Act, referring to the federal-provincial GRIP agreement.  

However in this clause being amended, we intend the definition 

to be broader than that.  Therefore we're using a synonym, the 

word "contract" to signify the broader meaning. 

 

Amendment agreed to.

Clause 20 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to 

make to this clause.  This clause is another one of those that is 

bringing in retroactivity and my amendment will repeal that 

retroactivity so that any changes must be made from the date 

the Bill is agreed to, not back to January 1, 1991.  This will 

remove the deeming part of the clause.  I will read the 

amendment, Mr. Chairman. 

 

 Amend clause 20 of the printed Bill by deleting subclauses 

(1) through (3) thereof and substituting the following 

therefor: 

 

  "20(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (4): 

 

  (a) this Act or any provision of this Act; or 

 

  (b) any amendment to The Agricultural Safety Net Act or 

The Crop Insurance Act that is being enacted by this 

Act; 

 

 comes into force on a day or days to be fixed by proclamation 

of the Lieutenant Governor 

 

  (2) Section 4 and clauses 5(1)(b) and (c) of this Act come 

into force on the day of assent. 

 

  (3) Clause 5(1)(a) of this Act comes into force on the day 

of assent." 

 

I so move, Mr. Chairman. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Chairman and Mr. Minister, we want to 

just say that you have a new law, but we want to know where 

justice is being served.  We want to know where justice is 

being served on the basis of the principle of the Charter of 

Rights and Freedoms.  And we want to say that we are opposed 

to this Bill on that basis. 

 

The Supreme Court ruled in a case with the Pearlman and 

Manitoba Law Society Judicial Committee and says: 

 

 The principles of fundamental justice to which this section 

refers include, but are not limited to, the rules of natural 

justice and the duty to act fairly.  (The duty to act fairly, Mr. 

Minister.)  They therefore include the requirement of a 

procedurally fair hearing before an impartial decision-maker. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chairman, as we have viewed what we 

have done here today against all of the intensity that a group of 

10 people can muster against an overwhelming majority, the 

options of closure that minister and the members opposite have 

foisted on the people of the province of Saskatchewan, the 

limitation in a democratic process as we have heard it over and 

over again by members opposite, and as we have learned and 

probably you have learned -- for the first time many of you -- 

that your responsibility is extended not only to the people of 

this Assembly but to the people of the province of 

Saskatchewan. 

 

And it's your responsibility to maintain the viability of the 

rights of individuals in the actions you take, and you will 



August 21, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 2889 

be for ever remembered in the decisions that you have made 

today and that you will conclude with on Monday when you 

seek the final reading of this Bill -- that you have taken away, 

as you did in December, the rights of individuals to appear 

before a court of law to have their case heard. 

 

And it is going to be remembered, ladies and gentlemen, and it 

will be put down in the judgements the Supreme Court will 

render some time in the future.  It will be rendered and I 

believe on the basis of the constitution itself.  Another 

precedent that has been established on the basis of common 

law -- you cannot restrict individuals from a court of law.  And 

you are doing that, ladies and gentlemen of this Assembly, by 

voting in favour of this. 

 

I've said it right from the beginning, and I will say it again: you 

are wrong.  You were wrong at the beginning, and you are 

wrong today.  And every time you have voted in this Assembly 

today, you have been wrong because you have taken away the 

individual rights and freedoms of individuals who have no 

chance to stand in here and defend themselves.  The only 

defence that people have in this Assembly to what you're doing 

is the defence that we have provided. 

 

And, Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, you have today 

decided that you're above the law.  You can live above the law 

and flaunt the law, but one day the court will tell you that you 

were wrong. 

 

And I say to this Assembly, this Assembly is going to have to 

deal with a matter on a special warrant, that I believe that this 

Minister of Agriculture or someone responsible for that 

department or the Minister of Finance are going to have to 

some day say to the chairman and the board of directors of 

Crop Insurance, you're going to have to pay for the inequities 

and the taking away of the opportunities before a court.  

Because they're going to say, you owe the people of the 

province of Saskatchewan X amount of dollars. 

 

And if the information provided to the court in Melville is 

accurate, on an average, for those who make a claim, it'll be 

pretty close to $30 an acre.  And this year in the north-east, 

those people are going to get caught on it, and in the 

north-west. 

 

And you can count on it, Mr. Minister, that before your term is 

up, you're going to have to make a decision on what you have 

done here today, on whether you're going to pay those people 

that $30 an acre.  Some it's going to be more.  And that, Mr. 

Minister, is what you're going to have to do.  And that will be 

the legacy of this government right to the last day. 

 

And I want to point out how very, very foolish politically this 

is, because it takes a while for the Supreme Court to rule on a 

matter, and by that time you may just be going into an election.  

And that's how really absolutely dumb it is.  There is absolutely 

no point, in a political sense, in an economic sense, for what 

you did here today and what you've done for the past six 

months.  That is the reason. 

 

And so, Mr. Chairman, and, Mr. Minister, we are against the 

coming into force of this Bill as strenuous today as we 

were the day we started.  And we haven't backed down at all, 

nor will we. 

 

However, you have the final authority.  And I recognize that 

the people voted for that in the fall, and I will abide by that.  

However, you are wrong in a court of law and we will wait to 

see what happens.

Mr. Toth: -- Mr. Chairman, a point of clarification.  I believe 

we still have an amendment on clause no. 9.  Would that come 

before we give the order to go into force? 

 

The Chair: -- We can proceed back to clause 9 at this point, if 

that's agreed. 

 

Clause 9 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: -- Yes, I appreciate the time to have our 

officials confer on the matter.  I understand there is some 

difference of opinion on the procedure.  It's a procedure that is . 

. . I have no investment in one way or the other.  But the advice 

of our officials, after having conferred with the legislative 

drafting section, is that the practice as reflected in the Bill as 

written is the practice that should be continued. 

 

I appreciate the amendment that the member opposite has 

offered.  It represents the other side of the opinion on this 

question.  But the advice I received from our officials 

conferring with legislative drafting is that we should leave the 

process as it's reflected in the Bill presently.

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Well, Mr. Chairman, I have to disagree.  

I believe this legislature is the place to make the changes and 

the amendments to any Bills that become law.  These changes 

are not to be made in the back rooms by bureaucrats. 

 

I asked the Law Clerk in his opinion what would happen if this 

kind of an amendment was voted down.  His opinion was that 

this was the place those amendments should be made, those 

changes should be made; and that if this amendment is lost, 

that it tells the drafting department that they are not to insert 

those numbers into the Bill in those places.  I have before me 

Bill No. 78.  I would like to read out clause 9 of that 

amendment to those Acts. 

 

 Section 16 is amended: 

 

  (a) by renumbering it as subsection 16(1); 

 

This comes from the same drafting department, legislative 

drafting department that the government's current Bill comes 

from.  This is totally different to what's there.  They have 

included that number, and I believe that this is the place where 

those changes should be made, Mr. Chairman, that they should 

not be made in the backrooms by some bureaucrat to correct an 

error made by the legislative drafting department. 

 

Amendment negatived on division.
