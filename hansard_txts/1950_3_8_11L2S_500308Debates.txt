LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Second Session — Eleventh Legislature 

15th Day 

 

Wednesday, March 8, 1950. 

 

The House met at three o’clock p.m. 

 

BUDGET ADDRESS 

 

Hon. C. M. Fines (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, I present this budget to you against the 

background of a disturbed world situation. The international scene, overclouded by the ―cold war‖ and 

the threat of an arms race for new and more devastating weapons, is further complicated by currency and 

related trade difficulties. It is a scene of grave possibilities and many uncertainties – the very opposite of 

that world of security and stability for which so many people believe they were making such great 

sacrifices a few short years ago. 

 

The currency problem – in other words, dollar shortages throughout the sterling area – constitutes one of 

the major obstacles to a freer movement of goods and to the full implementation of the Geneva and other 

trade agreements. The problem offers a continuing challenge, and perhaps for further which, sitting in 

the driver’s seat, can most effectively provide the necessary solutions. The problem is of particular 

concern to Canadian agriculture whose loss of vital food contracts causes anxiety concerning the 

disposal of future surpluses. The economic situation calls for masterly statesmanship, tact and goodwill. 

I understand that another round of tariff talks, involving 33 countries, is scheduled to start next 

September. I am sure that all members will unite in the hope that something positive and effectual will 

emerge from these deliberations. 

 

The Canadian economy, stimulated by new capital investment of $3,280,000,000, experienced a 

continued expansion of employment and total production in 1949. Towards the end of the year, 

however, unemployment figures began to rise above previous seasonal levels and this trend has 

continued throughout the winter months. 

 

Though the physical volume of Canadian exports was lower than in the preceding year, an increase was 

reported in sales of both capital and consumer goods in the domestic market. But there was some 

evidence that installment buying was on the increase, sales on that basis during the second quarter of 

1949 running 20 per cent over the corresponding period of 1948.

The Canadian agricultural industry faces the 1950 season with serious misgivings concerning markets, 

prices and the effects on the farm economy of recent freight rate increases. Cash income from the sale of 

farm products for the twelve-month period ended June last, reached the record total of $2,467,528,000, 

nearly $40,00,000 higher than the peak figure of 1948. Farm debt has been reduced, and a large backlog 

of machinery and equipment filled, either by cash or large down-payment purchases. During the past 

three years, farm equipment sales have increased from $122,400,000 in 1947 to an estimated 

$211,000,000 in 1949. 

 

Saskatchewan agriculture reflects the national picture. The farming community feels it has been let 

down. It is disillusioned. It feels that the security afforded by the United Kingdom food contracts since 

the war, has been seriously impaired, and that the reduction in export outlets may lead to the piling of 

surpluses and a consequent decline in prices of farm products. Saskatchewan farmers are not blaming 

the British Government for this situation. They realize the dollar difficulties, and they are prepared to 

deal generously with a people who have endured so much austerity in their recovery efforts. 

 

Statistics relating to the 1949 agricultural production in Saskatchewan strongly reflect the effects of the 

severe drought which again afflicted the southwestern and west-central portions of the province last 

summer. Some 4,400,000 acres, representing 28 per cent of the total acreage in production, recorded 

yields of five bushels or less, as compared with the 656,000 acres, or five per cent affected in the 

previous year. Some 45,000 farmers qualified for payments under the Prairie Farm Assistance Act in the 

amount of $13,000,000. 

 

Estimates of production of the principal grain corps show considerable overall reduction from 1948 

levels, the total estimated value being down 16 per cent. The 1949 value is placed at $357,456,000, 

compared with $423,682,000 in 1948. Notwithstanding the drop in value, preliminary estimates of the 

cash farm income for 1949 range higher than the preceding year’s by more than $17,000,000, and, 

indeed, fall short of the peak year, 1944, by less than half a million dollars. The estimates for last year 

place the cash farm income at $554,848,000, compared with $537,267,000 in 1948, and $555,289,000 in 

1944. The increase from 1948 is directly attributable to the fact that, last year, $115,000,000 was 

received by Saskatchewan farmers in payments on wheat participation certificates covering past 

deliveries, as against $30,000,000 made a welcome addition to farmers’ incomes for 1949. 

 

Livestock population figures are based on estimates made on June 1, each year. These show reductions 

in 1949 in all categories except swine, but, of course, reveal nothing of what effect the uncertain market 

situation may have had since. The reduction in the cattle population as at June 1, 1950, is partly due to a 

leveling off from post-war peaks, and partly to the opening of the American market, beef prices having 

remained relatively consistent. Marketings of cattle, sheep and hogs all show declines from 1948 levels. 

Creamery butter and milk production, in 1949, were down seven per cent from the previous year. A drop 

occurred in the production of eggs, honey, and wool.

Production in the mineral industries during the past year was accompanied by a tremendous upsurge of 

interest and activity in exploratory work. Anticipations are that mineral production will progressively 

increase, and that the intensive and extensive search programmes for oil and uranium will result in 

substantial expansion of Saskatchewan’s mineral industry. The new wealth and employment thus 

created will become an increasingly important factor in the provincial economy. 

 

The estimated value of mineral output for 1949 is $33,969,000, exceeding by more than one million 

dollars the actual value of the 1948 output. 

 

The Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company at Flin Flon is constructing a new $5,000,000 zinc 

recovery plant. This investment is indicative of the faith this company has in the future of its operations 

in the province, and of the confidence it has that the policies of this Government are no deterrent to 

legitimate enterprise. 

 

Two significant features of non-metallic production during 1949, will, I am sure, be of interest to hon. 

members. The first is that the plant of The Prairie Salt Company recorded its first production of salt in 

May of last year, thus heralding the birth of a new and, we hope, expanding industry in Saskatchewan. 

 

The second is that, in spite of the work stoppage which affected the coal industry in the Estevan-Bienfait 

district in the latter part of 1948 and the beginning of 1949, and in spite of the increasing use of oil as a 

competitive fuel, coal production in Saskatchewan, last year, reached a new high record at 1,869,910 

tons, compared with 1,595,870 tons, in the previous year. 

 

In the exploratory field, more mineral claims were staked during 1949 than in any previous year. Claims 

staked numbered 1,046, bringing the total of claims in good standing at January 1, 1950, to 2,252. This 

Government’s Prospectors’ Assistance Plan, inaugurated two summers ago, under which free mining 

licences, free recording of claims, free assays, transportation, geological advice and supplies of essential 

equipment are provided, is largely responsible for the very promising finds of radio-active minerals 

which are now in the early stages of development. With world-wide attention concentrated on these 

minerals, the activity here is attracting widespread interest. When major development takes place, 

however, our hope is that the product will be devoted to industrial rather than military uses. 

 

Saskatchewan now has three potentially productive uranium fields located in the Lake Athabasca, Black 

Lake and Lac la Ronge areas. The operating companies report encouraging results and, by the end of the 

present year, it should be possible to estimate the productive capacity of several of the properties. Other 

less spectacular discoveries of gold and base metals also resulted from the increasing interest of mining 

concerns in Saskatchewan’s northland. 

 

A unique feature of the government’s mineral development programme is the prospecting training being 

given the native population of the north. Reference already has been made, at this Session, to this part of 

the 

  



 

March 8, 1950 

 

 

4 

 

programme. I mention it merely to emphasize the efforts of this Government to stimulate prospecting 

and to provide new opportunities for the long-neglected native people scattered through our north 

country. 

 

The estimated value of petroleum production in Saskatchewan during 1949 is $1,250,000, an increase of 

$300,000 over the preceding year. Natural gas output rose 10 per cent. Oil production is steadily 

climbing and will continue to climb, for the intensive explorations now in progress may well prove to be 

the most important event in Saskatchewan’s economic history since the settlement of our fertile 

agricultural lands. Twenty-seven geophysical parties, using every modern type of geophysical 

equipment, were active during 1949, with surveys of three types: serial magnetometer, gravimetric and 

seismic. 

 

Many of the largest and best-financed Canadian and American oil companies have now joined the 

search. Approximately 35,000,000 acres of Crown gas and oil rights were held by the oil companies at 

December 31, 1949. In addition, millions of acres of privately-owned gas and oil rights have been 

leased. The expenditure during 1949 on geophysical surveys and drilling alone is estimated at 

$1,166,000, while the forecast expenditure for 1950 is in excess of $5,000,000. 

 

The primary industries of the north – fish, fur and timber – present a more mixed picture. With respect 

to the fishing industry, the volume of the catch was only slightly lower than the previous year. But the 

collapse of export prices caused by market gluts would have placed ruinous burdens upon the individual 

fisherman had not the Saskatchewan Fish Board absorbed the large part of the loss involved. It became 

clear during the course of the year just past, however, that a crown company could not be expected to 

cover the losses of a marginal industry. A complete re-organization was, therefore, effected to transform 

the corporation from a buying and selling agency to a marketing service, similar to the Saskatchewan 

Fur Marketing Service. 

 

Wide fur production during 1948-49 had an aggregate value of $1,992,274, some half million dollars 

less than in the previous year, while value of ranch fur dropped sharply because of the lower prices for 

pelts. Conservation measures taken to preserve and increase the muskrat and beaver population have 

proved effective. The annual catch of these our main furbearing animals, is on a quota basis, and no 

trapping is allowed until there are sufficient animals to warrant trapping without unduly depleting capital 

stock. Even with these restrictions, it has been possible to increase the trapping quota each year over the 

past four years. The beaver take has increased from 473 in the 1944-45 season to 10,818 in 1949-49. 

During the same period, the muskrat take increased from 114,481, to 722,542. 

 

Softer prices and further restrictions of the cut under the long-term management and sustained yield 

programme for our forests were reflected in a small decline in the value of forest products. Annual 

production is being gradually reduced in order to extend the life of our sadly depleted commercial 

timber stands. Through scientific forest management and conservation programmes designed to effect a 

balance between production and annual tree growth or increment, annual output has already been 

reduced from a past peak of 150,000,000 feet board measure to 60,000,000 feet. The Government is 

erecting a high 

  



 

March 8, 1950

utilization sawmill at Big River, within access of the Dore-Smoothstone Lakes spruce stand, one of the 

larges and best of the remaining timber stands in the province. 

 

The major problem in managing these resources, so ruthlessly exploited in the past, has become one of 

the developing the economic utilization of all our forest species. To this end continuing study is being 

given to ways and means of encouraging secondary wood-using industries. 

 

For the most part, the past year has witnessed high levels of activity in our leading manufacturing 

industries – those connected with the processing of our farm products such as meat packing, flour 

milling and dairy output. The gross value of production rose well above the $200 million mark in 1948, 

and it would appear that 1949 will have surpassed this level. The growth of our secondary industry since 

1944 – an increase of about 15 per cent – has been a substantial one. It is particularly encouraging to a 

Government which has seriously concerned itself with the challenge of building up a more diversified 

economy in Saskatchewan. 

 

In this integral part of our programme for the province we have been anxious not only to secure greater 

economic stability, but also to provide opportunities for our people. For the most part we believe that 

private and co-operative enterprise is best suited to enter into competitive fields of secondary industry, 

such as the manufacture of consumer goods. Our policy is to aid and encourage such development – and 

we are prepared to offer special financial assistance through the Industrial Development Fund and Co-

operative Guarantee Act. New capital investment and maintenance expenditure in manufacturing in each 

of the past three years has been close to the $8 million mark – far higher than at any time in the past. 

 

The Government itself, while relying chiefly upon private and co-operative organization, has felt the 

need and its responsibility for some bold, positive experimentation in this field. Saskatchewan Industries 

has been an attempt to accomplish these things: to develop further uses for the raw materials from our 

farms, to provide training and employment in skilled trades for the growing urban population, and to 

produce useful goods at acceptable prices for local consumption. One of our efforts in this direction – 

the leather products industry – has had to be given up. Difficulties with raw materials and production 

technique, the limited scope of our market, and competition with low wage plants in the east, all 

combined to make it impossible to operate successfully. The woolen mill is not yet fully paving its own 

way. But as the annual report indicates, such substantial improvement has been effected that it gives real 

hope for successful and profitable operation. It has already attracted the interest and concrete action of 

clothing manufacturers in establishing themselves in these province. And we think its importance to our 

general programme of industrial development fully justifies a further, continued trial. 

 

The construction industry in 1949 reached a new record level for the province, with contracts being 

awarded to the value of $43 million. The previous high of $34 million occurred in 1929. In terms of 

value of work 

  



 

March 8, 1950 

 

 

6 

 

actually performed, 1949 also recorded a new high of $26 million, an increase of 9 per cent over the 

previous year. More detailed analysis shows that the postwar boom in residential building is leveling off, 

but substantial increases are being recorded in other types of construction. 

 

Transport and Utilities also maintained record activity throughout 1949. Revenue freight car loadings in 

the province advanced about 14 per cent over the previous year. But as I noted last year increasingly 

severe and discriminatory burdens have been placed upon the Canadian prairies as a result of the 

cumulative percentage increases in the freight rate structure. The last of these has only recently been 

announced, boosting rates to 40.4 per cent over the 1948 level. Our government has joined with the 

other prairie provinces in battling against these increases but with only limited success. But we shall 

insist to the utmost that the vital Crows Nest Pass grain rates must and shall be protected. 

 

In the field of passenger transport our publicly-owned bus lines have enjoyed a highly successful year. 

The Company’s buses carried passengers and express, approximately 10,000 miles daily. Seven new 

schedule runs were added and additional new equipment secured. The total number of employees 

reached 264, with an average monthly payroll of over $44,000. By extending and instating emergency 

runs, the Company has been able to provide service necessitated by the reductions ordered by the CNR 

during this current winter. 

 

In the far north, Saskatchewan airways expanded their overall operations. Air transport has rightly been 

called the key to the development of the north. Our publicly-owned airways provided regular and charter 

flights for passengers, mail, express and freight, performing these services at cost. They are playing a 

vital role in the opening up of the vast wealth that lies locked within that remote wilderness of rock, lake 

and forest. 

 

The output of electric power generated in central electric stations of the province, excluding northern 

waterpower plants, rose to a total of 353 million kilowatt-hours in 1949. Estimated revenue from the sale 

of this energy now approximates $11,000,000. The Saskatchewan Power Corporation further 

consolidated its position as a major factor in this basic utility field. Output increased by 15 per cent over 

1948, and over 200 million kilowatt-hours were distributed through its meters. The transmission 

network was further extended to link up 47 additional centres. At the close of the year the Corporation 

operated 4,600 miles of network serving 58,000 customers. 

 

Two particular aspects of the steady growth of the Corporation seem to merit attention. First, our 

progress in farm electrification. During the year, special attention was given to organizing and testing 

service under our new act. The objective of 1,200 additional farms was successfully accomplished and 

the groundwork laid for the future. The Corporation is fully alive to its responsibilities in working out 

realistic methods of bringing the benefits of electric power to as many farms as possible. It is, in fact, 

carrying this to the point where costs equal income with a resultant decline in our rate of earnings. But 

we believe that in this basic service ―power at cost‖ must be the principle for Saskatchewan.

A second aspect of the programme is the consciously-planned policy of the Corporation to tap and to 

utilize all the various energy resources of the Province. The most important of these today are the 

extensive lignite coal fields of the south, and these provide the major source of energy for the system 

today. But the development of natural gas and petroleum fuels from the north-eastern section is of 

growing importance and the Corporation is following a careful policy of integrating the use of these 

resources into a longer-term programme. To the same end, careful study is being given in conjunction 

with P.F.R.A. to the hydro-electric power potential for the proposed South Saskatchewan river 

development. 

 

The year 1949 proved to be a record-breaking one for the Saskatchewan Government Telephones. 

 

During 1949: 

 

(a) More new installations (6,138) were made than in any previous year. 
 

(b) More stations (70,460) were in use than in any previous years. 
 

(c) More long distance calls (5,176,445) originated in Saskatchewan than in any previous year. 
 

(d) More money was spent on construction ($3,005,000) than in any previous year. 
 

(e) The profit ($1,282,160) was the greatest in the history of the company. 
 

Notwithstanding these excellent record-breaking achievements, much remains to be done. There is still a 

heavy waiting list of people desiring telephone service. Our long distance facilities are still inadequate. 

It is hoped that during 1950 we will go a long way towards providing these needs, and that 

Saskatchewan will still have the record of having one of the finest telephone services in the world. 

 

Trade and commercial activity generally during 1949 reflected the high level of purchasing power in the 

hands of our people. Estimates of retail trade for the province rose to more than half a billion dollars – a 

gain of 13 per cent over 1948. A comparable advance was recorded in the overall measure of economic 

activity – the volume of cheques cashed at clearing centres. These rose to $2.4 billions. 

 

Business enterprise indicted a continued keenness to share in the economic growth of the province, and 

substantial increases in business incorporations and registrations were noted in 1948-49. During the 

period under review, 155 new companies, capitalized at $23 million, were incorporated. At the same 

time, 587 new partnerships were registered. New capital continue to flow into the province and 133 

outside corporations, with total capitalization of $1.2 billion, registered to do business in the province 

for the first time. 

  



 

March 8, 1950

All these figures represent important increases over the earlier records set in 1947 and 1948. I suggest 

that they speak for themselves. 

 

It is hardly necessary for me to note that the co-operative movement continued its basically important 

role in production and distribution activity. Further growth in numbers, membership and assets of co-

operative associations and credit unions was strikingly evident during the 1948-49 fiscal year. Assets of 

co-operative associations rose by 15 per cent to reach a record level of $74 million. Their volume of 

business expanded by 21 per cent to the level of $267 million. Assets of credit unions more than kept 

pace with a rate of increase of 32 per cent during the year. The importance of these institutions as 

agencies for credit to meet specialized needs is reflected in the total of loans issued during 1948-49 of 

$6.2 million, an advance of $1.5 million over the previous year. 

 

Throughout this general review, Mr. Speaker, I have made several references to the part being played by 

some of our publicly-owned enterprises in the economic development of the province. But no budget 

address would now be complete without a summary accounting and appraisal of this part of the 

Government’s programme. The detailed reports and audited statements of each of the corporations have 

been laid before the House. The overall financial results on operations during 1948-49 are reflected in 

the report of the Government Finance Office as at March 31, 1949. This shows a net revenue of over $3 

million, representing a return of approximately 8.9 per cent on advances from the Treasury. Individual 

reports covering operations during fiscal years ending in late 1949 indicate varied results, but interim 

figures show an overall rate of return of about 7.5 per cent. When losses of the discontinued operations 

are excluded, net earning of $3,270,000 on average advances of $39,440,000 show a rate of return of 8.2 

per cent. Major factors in accounting for the decline from last year were losses on discontinued 

operations and lower rates of return for the Timber Board, Saskatchewan Minerals and the Power 

Corporation. 

 

The earnings and profits of our public enterprises are, of course, fundamentally important, and we have 

previously announced that companies which cannot pay their own way after a fair trail will 

discontinued, unless they are providing an essential public service. But I desire to stress again that in the 

government view the significance and success of the corporations are not measured merely in terms of 

the rate of profit. Many other tests may be applied from the social viewpoint. 

 

I have noted the economic value and the enormous social contribution now being provided by our power 

and telephone utilities. To these services have been added the bus lines and the airways, integral parts of 

a complete transport picture for the province. Then there is the Insurance Office. Not only has the office 

earned substantial revenues for its owners – the people of the province – but by its influence in holding 

down competitive rates, it has made large savings possible for all our people. And it has been the 

medium through which the incalculable benefits of the automobile insurance plan have successfully 

been secured for thousands of Saskatchewan citizens. 

 

With other corporations we have been chiefly concerned to effect the rational development of our 

resources – husbanding them with care to counteract the ruthless despoliation of the past, bringing them 

to use where they have 

  



 

March 8, 1950

lain dormant and neglected for centuries. Then again, our efforts have been directed to the formidable 

and complicated problem of promoting and establishing new processing and manufacturing industries. 

Our experience to date has stressed the need for careful analysis and study, and pointed still more 

emphatically to the importance of developing these long neglected parts of our economy. The problems 

encountered have been many and difficult, but they have been and will be tackled with a sense of the 

social purpose to be fulfilled. 

 

Our publicly owned enterprises in all fields now provide jobs for over 3,000 men and women. They are 

employed under the best wage and working conditions possible. In 1949, the employees received a total 

of $6,354,000 in wage income. The companies transacted a gross volume of business accounting to 

almost $25 million. It is, to be sure, a small sum in comparison with the huge wealth flowing through the 

coffers of many of the gigantic monopolies which dominate the economic life of our country. But every 

citizen of the province has a personal stack in our public enterprises, an ultimate voice in their 

ownership and control. 

 

The advance of our non-agricultural industries is reflected in a growth of employment of about 4 per 

cent in 1949 over the previous year. Moreover, it would appear that with the increasing mechanization 

of our farms and the growth in the size of farm units, a higher proportion of our people are now living in 

the urban centres. But members of the Legislature will be pleased to know that the latest D.B.S. figures 

again shows an increase in total provincial population. A gain of 7,000 persons has been recorded since 

my last budget address, and our population now stands in excess of 861,000 people. 

 

The continued general prosperity of our Province in the past year has reflected favorably in financial 

affairs of all three levels of government. Municipalities generally have enjoyed higher revenues from all 

sources, and deficit budgeting has been notably reduced. At the same time, expenditure upon local 

public works has been greatly expanded, and with the close co-operation and support of the Provincial 

Government, vastly improved public services in education and welfare are being provided. Thus 

combined provincial-municipal expenditure on education has risen from $15 per capita in 1943-44 to 

$27 in 1948-49, and the proportion supplied by the Province has increased from 28 per cent to over 33 

per cent. In health and public welfare, combined expenditure per capita has risen over the same period 

from $7.60 to $25.80 – and the provincial share has increased from 51 per cent to 72 per cent. 

 

In my address last year, I noted the very substantial aid we are now giving the municipalities. The details 

are on record and need not be repeated here. But I must stress again that since first coming to office this 

Government has relieved the municipalities of crushing burdens of relief indebtedness. It has taken over 

a great share or even 100 per cent responsibility for many essential services. And it has more than 

trebled direct cash payments to local governments. 

 

There is, of course much more that we are anxious to do. In a country such as ours, financially healthy 

municipal institutions are basically important. They are necessary to the efficient discharge of local 

services. They provide the essential foundations of democratic self-government. And this administration 

firmly believes that the objectives of minimum public services and adequate fiscal resources are as valid 

at the provincial-municipal level, as they are in the federal-provincial sphere. The policies of this 

Government 

  



 

March 8, 1950 

 

 

10 

 

have been directed toward these objectives from the very beginning. They will be both continued and 

improved. 

 

But attention must be drawn again to the fact that seven provinces of the Dominion still await action by 

the Federal Government to give effect to comprehensive health and social security measures. First 

advanced five years ago as an integral part of the postwar reconstruction, they are still desperately 

awaited by millions of Canadians. Tremendous public pressure has wrung from Ottawa some slight 

token action – the health grants, pension increase and recent unemployment insurance extension. But for 

the most part these gestures have served only to increase the financial load upon this province. Until 

genuine, national programmes are introduced, we are compelled to carry the major burdens alone. 

Consequently we find ourselves severely restricted in our further anxiety to assist the municipalities. 

 

As honourable members of the Legislature are aware, a new Dominion-Provincial conference to 

consider pressing economic questions has now been called for the fall of this year. We intend at that 

time to press for action along the lines advocated by the Rowell-Sirois Commission, which led to the 

1945 proposals. If these can be accomplished, the way will be cleared for a more equitable distribution 

of all our financial burdens – federal, provincial and municipal alike. 

 

On February 21st, I tabled the Public Accounts for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1949. It is most 

gratifying, I am sure, to all Members of the Assembly, including the Opposition, to have learned that the 

continued buoyancy of revenues, together with the careful administration of the government, has made it 

possible for me to report another substantial surplus on revenue account. 

 

This surplus of $1,014,000 was obtained after using only $4,000,000 of the liquor profits. Had we used 

all these profits for revenue purposes, the surplus would have been $4,560,000. 

 

Last year, the Legislature passed a total of $49,101,220 estimated expenditures. During the year it was 

deemed advisable to incur further revenue expenditures requiring a supplementary vote amounting to 

$5,166,554, of which some $1,500,000 was for inter-departmental payments and returnable to the 

Treasury. Thus the total estimated net expenditures for the current year will amount to $52,700,000 

approximately. 

 

Revenues during the year have continued to be reflected in the amount of our annual subsidy, which will 

be approximately $800,000 more than was anticipated. 

 

Notwithstanding the drought in a large area of the province, the Education Tax receipts still continue to 

rise. This reflects the continued increased cost of goods, as well as the increased industrial activity in the 

province.

Gasoline tax receipts are considerably higher this year reflecting an increased number of cars on the 

highways as well as a greater amount of winter driving resulting from the policy of the highways 

department in keeping a great many roads open. 

 

During the current fiscal year three issues of debentures were sold. 

 

The first issue of $3,000,000 dated June 1, maturing in 1964 and bearing interest at 3¾% was sold by 

the syndicate at a price of 96.75 to yield 4.04% 

 

The second issue of $4,000,000 dated October 1, was made up as follows: 

 

$1,000,000 – 3% serial debentures maturing $200,000 annually each year to 1954. 

 

$3,000,000 – 3¾% debentures maturing in 1965. 

 

The former issue was sold privately at a price of $99.50. The $3,000,000 issue was sold by the syndicate 

at a price of $97.07 to yield 4%. 

 

The third issue of $2,500,000 dated February 1, maturing in 1968 and bearing interest at 3½% was sold 

by the syndicate at a price of $99.75 to yield 3.52%. The demand for this issue was so great that the 

dealers applied for an additional number of bonds to be marketed at the same price. Thus we were able 

to increase the original $2,500,000.00 to $3,400,000.00. 

 

The successful marketing of these issues indicates the soundness of the policy followed by the Treasury 

in reducing our indebtedness. This improved credit rating must not only be maintained but constantly 

improved, as reduced interest rates mean a smaller proton of the budget required for debt financing. 

 

This improved position and the esteem in which the province is held by the investing public is reflected 

in the following table of average yields of intermediate term bonds of certain provinces:

1948 3.83 2.95 2.70 3.09 

1950 3.50 3.00 2.91 3.52 

 

In addition to the amounts borrowed during the current fiscal year, there was $4,000,000 in January 

1949, making in all $11,000,000 borrowed during the calendar year 1949. This is not, however, the 

amount by which the debt was increased during the year. The following table shows that the net increase 

during the calendar year was $3,286,445:

During the year the gross debt has been reduced by $17,327,317. This large reduction was made 

possible by the cancellation of $11,720,000 debentures issued on behalf of the Wheat Pool. On 

September 10, the pool made a payment of $465,000, the final payment of the indebtedness of 

approximately $22,000,000 of principal and interest which the pool undertook to repay the government 

in 1933. During the life of the agreement the Wheat Pool had not only met its obligations on the due 

date but, because of the efficient operations of the Sinking Fund Trustees, has been able to pay off the 

entire indebtedness two years in advance. There are still outstanding just over $2,000,000 of debentures, 

which will be redeemed on October 1, 1951, at which time any incidental costs connected with the issue 

will be adjusted between the Government and the Wheat Pool. 

 

During the year other issues held entirely in the sinking funds, have been cancelled. This has resulted in 

a reduction not only in the gross debt, but also in the sinking funds, and will result in a reduction in the 

annual carrying charge of this portion of the indebtedness. 

 

The debt of the province has been reduced by over $66,000,000 since April 1, 1944. This reduction has 

been accomplished in spite of the fact that capital expenditures totaling over $47,000,000 have been 

incurred during this period. 

 

It is not only the quantity of the debt which has been improved, but also its quality. In 1944 a very large 

part of the debt was dead weight and very little of it self-liquidating. Today, that situation has been 

reversed. The dead weight debt has been sharply reduced, partly due to the cancellation by the Dominion 

of certain relief treasury bills, and partly to payments from current revenues of the province. On the 

other hand there has been an increase in the self-liquidating debt incurred for such purposes as power, 

telephones, and crown corporations. 

 

I would like to turn now to the budget for the current year. The details of estimated revenues and 

expenditures have been tabled. These estimates provide for an anticipated surplus of $33,150, made up 

as follows: 

 

Estimated Receipts $55,053,910 

Estimated Expenditures $55,020,760 

  

 $      33,150 

 

  



 

March 8, 1950 

 

 

13 

 

The estimated expenditures of $55,020,760 compare with an estimated $49,101,220, last year. 

 

Each of the past three years I have pointed out that we were living in a period of relatively great 

prosperity with very buoyant revenues, and that our existing revenues would not enable us to provide 

additional services without finding new sources of revenue. Because of this buoyant condition and 

because of the inflation of the Canadian dollar our revenues have risen without increasing taxes, while at 

the same time it has cost more to provide the same services, thus increasing our expenditures very 

greatly. 

 

We sometimes hear criticisms of provincial governments’ budgets being much higher than they were six 

or seven years ago. When we remember however, that the value of our dollar today is only about 60¢, 

then we can quite easily realize that our proposed $55,000,000 budget is in reality only a $33,000,000 

one. 

 

This fact is very evident to the wage-earner whose pay cheque for $200 will not go as far as his pre-war 

cheque for $125, to the farmer who finds himself handling a great deal more money, but having none of 

it left at the end of the year. 

 

In my opinion, we have now passed the peak, and from now on revenues will decline. I do not anticipate 

any sudden fall during the next six months, but rather a steady, gradual decline. What will happen after 

that time will depend on crop conditions and on our ability to dispose of our agricultural products at 

reasonable prices. 

 

Estimates of the amounts required for capital purposes now before you are for a total of $17,973,000. It 

is to be noted that of this amount the larger part is required to meet the needs of the utilities. 

 

During the coming year, it is proposed to spend a total of $5,000,000 on behalf of the Power 

Corporation. The purpose of this amount is for the construction of additional generating capacity, for 

distribution lines, and for new connections. 

 

We are asking for $4,160,000 for the Telephone Corporation. This will provide new installations and 

will provide additional exchange and long distance facilities. At the present time there are requests for 

approximately 7,000 new installations. 

 

For construction of highways and bridges you will be asked to provide $3,000,000. 

 

The other major expenditures on capital account will be for public works. These will provide for 

completion of several new buildings at the University and the Industrial School. In addition, it will 

provide for some extensions and improvements at the Mental Hospitals. It will also provide for the 

beginning of a new training school for the mentally defectives at Moose Jaw and for a new 

administration building in Regina. The purpose of the latter is to consolidate the offices which, at the 

present time, are scattered in various parts of the city. This will lead to increase deficiency and a 

reduction in costs of administration.

Thus it can be seen that the capital programme will be largely a self-liquidating one. 

 

This year the Legislature will be asked to vote $8,590,490 for debt charges, an increase of $575,000 

over last year. It is anticipated that $135,000 will be required to pay the premium on the American 

currency necessary for the interest on that part of our debt payable in the U.S.A. This is one of the 

effects of the devaluation of our dollar last September. The main increase, however, is in the amount 

necessary for sinking fund payments, which amount this year to $997,210, an increase of $232,000 over 

last year. 

 

In the past few years I have been endeavoring to build up our sinking funds so that when debentures 

mature it will not be necessary to refund the whole amount. Prior to 1946 there was a sinking fund of 

1% on only about 30% of our debentures debt. During 1947 and 1948 we arranged a sinking fund of 2% 

on all borrowings those years. During the present year we have provided for a sinking fund of 3% on 

each of the three issues mentioned earlier. At the latter rate at the end of a twenty year period, with 

earnings invested, there will be a sufficiently high sinking fund to enable the province to pay off 

practically the entire debenture. It is my hope that this policy can be continued, so that we can be 

relieved of the interest burden, which has in the past taken such a large share of the tax dollar. 

 

During the next year the province will spend $6,392,000 from current account and $3,000,000 from 

capital account, a total of $9,392,000 on highway construction and maintenance. In addition to this it 

will be necessary to budget for over $2,000,000 to meet the sinking fund and interest charges on the debt 

of $30,162,000 incurred for highway construction, for the most part fifteen or twenty years ago, and on 

some of which interest rates of 6% are still being paid. Thus there will be spent this year on behalf of our 

highways $11,500,000, the largest amount in the history of Saskatchewan, and more than was spent in 

the 5 years prior to 1944. 

 

Against this expenditure, however, it is anticipated that motorists will pay to the treasury $7,000,000 in 

gasoline taxes and $3,150,000 in license fees. From this should be deducted $360,000 to be spend for 

licence plates and their insurance, highway traffic supervision, dyeing of gasoline, and other 

administrative expenses, leaving the total net revenue from motorists of $9,790,000. This means that the 

motorists are $1,710,000 short of paying for what they are getting. 

 

In the vote for the Highways is included a sum of $1,000,000 representing the province’s share of the 

first year’s expenditure on the Trans Canada Highway. It is hoped that the agreement can be completed 

at an early date in order that the work may be commenced immediately on this long over-due project. 

 

Estimates for the Education Department on revenue account this year will be $9,131,000 compared with 

$7,554,340 last year, an increase of $1,576,660. 

 

Grants to schools will be increased by $1,192,000 bringing these to a new high of $6,445,300. It is 

hoped that these increased grants will help the local districts and units in their efforts to provide better

educational facilities for the young people of their communities. 

 

At this time I would draw the attention of hon. members to an item of $115,000 in the supplementary 

estimates. This is to provide for scholarships and loans for worthy students. The fund of $1,000,000 as 

provided for in the 1949 legislation was set up at the beginning of the fiscal year. However, it was felt 

by the trustees of the fund, and concurred in by the government that the fund should have a full year to 

operate without any sums being drawn from it. Hence, the decision to provide by special warrant, an 

amount sufficient to provide all loans and scholarships for the current year. It is anticipated that he 

amount of the fund at the beginning of the next fiscal year will be approximately $1,100,000. 

 

The grant to the University of Saskatchewan has been increased to $1,125,000, an increase of $225,000 

over last year. In addition to this, an amount of $595,000 is being provided to complete the unfinished 

buildings at the University, other than the hospital. Thus, there will be $1,720,000 from provincial funds 

for the use of the University during the next year. 

 

At this time, it may be of interest to the members to learn that the total amount of provincial government 

grants and construction for the University has amounted to $9,573,019 since April, 1945, an average of 

$1,595,000 per year. Compare that with the total of $3,248,558 in the previous six years, an average of 

$541,000 per year . . . 

 

The total proposed expenditure of $9,131,000 on education is of course an all-time record for the 

province and compares with a total of $4,073,000 six short years ago. 

 

This year, in accordance with the policy of amalgamating the Public Health Department and the Health 

Services Planning Commission, as announced by the Minister, it has been considered advisable to show 

the proposed expenditures under one vote. This year for health services you will be asked to approve a 

total of $12,320,460, compared with $10,398,750 last year, an increase of nearly $2,000,000. This 

increase is largely for the hospitalization plan. While the revenues from the hospitalization tax have 

remained at under $6,000,000 each year the costs have risen to well over $10,000,000 with the 

expectation this year that they may reach $11,000,000. This cost is due to the increased number of 

people being admitted to the hospitals (due largely to the increased number of beds) and to the increased 

cost per patient day charged by the hospitals. The experience in Saskatchewan is not unique. In other 

parts of Canada hospitals are threatening to close their doors, or are being heavily subsidized by 

municipalities. 

 

In British Columbia after fifteen months of operation of their hospitalization plan, there was an overall 

deficit of $4,587,000, with an anticipated deficit of $7,000,000 after 27 months of operation. This result 

occurred, notwithstanding the fact that the hospital tax, originally $15 for single persons, $24 for 

couples, and $33 for families of 3 or more persons, was raised to $21 for single persons and $33 for 

couples or families – an increase of 32%. In Saskatchewan we have kept our rates at $10 for single 

persons, $20 for couples and $5 for dependents, with a maximum per family of $30. 

 

  



 

March 8, 1950

When the Saskatchewan plan was introduced it was anticipated it would be self-supporting except for 

the special subsidies originally provided for. These included the statutory 50¢ per day grants to 

hospitals, and the cost of providing hospitalization to Old Age Pensioners, and those in receipt of 

Mothers Allowance and Blind Pensions. It was understood there would be no further responsibility for 

the treasury to find other revenues. However, it is now apparent that there will be an annual deficit of 

over $3,000,000. The government has considered the various alternatives of meeting this situation. 

 

By requiring the patient to pay the first $20 on admission to the hospital we could get approximately 

$3,000,000 from the 153,411 people who used the hospitals in 1949. This, however, would weaken the 

principle of hospital insurance, which provides for the premium paid in advance in relieving the 

individual of paying at the time he requires the service. In addition, it would prevent many people using 

the service, which should be available to all, regardless of their financial ability. The government has 

therefore decided against raising the revenue to meet the deficit in this way. 

 

We then considered an increase in the amount of the premium. If we raised our rates to those presently 

charged in British Columbia, namely $21 for single persons and $33 for couples or families, we would 

be able to collect approximately $3,000,000 additional. 

 

Any such increase however would add to what we consider is already an unjust principle of taxation. 

When the present hospitalization plan was introduced we had anticipated that long before this time the 

federal government would have introduced its health programme as outlined in the green book proposals 

in 1945. Under this plan they would contribute 60% of the cost of the hospitalization, but insisted that 

each province would levy a per capita tax on the individual. Such a tax violates the principal of taxation 

based upon ability to pay, as it requires that each person pays the same tax irrespective of the amount of 

income. We have therefore decided against meeting the deficit by increasing the hospital tax. 

 

We have considered what method could best be used to raise the amount of the deficit, and which at the 

same time would not have the objections already referred to. This led us to consider the extension of the 

present education tax. 

 

This tax has been criticized more than any other provincial tax, but this criticism has usually been 

political, and not based on sound reasoning. As originally drafted with few exemptions the tax did have 

some vicious features. Any tax on food stuffs must be considered regressive. The same is true of the tax 

on many other necessities for which the poorest person in the province must pay as much as the 

wealthiest. It has been my purpose to remove these regressive features. In the last five years this has 

been done to a large extent by the removal of the tax on: 

 

(a) Foodstuffs of all kinds 
 

(b) Meals and lunches 
 

  



 

March 8, 1950 

 

 

17 

 

(c) All drugs and prescriptions 
 

(d) Soaps and cleaners 
 

(e) Second-hand goods 
 

(f) Weed control chemicals and sprayers 
 

(g) Animal feeds 
 

Legislation will be introduced at this session to remove the tax on: 

 

(a) Fertilizers 
 

(b) Grasshopper bait 
 

(c) Forage crop seed 
 

(d) Garden seeds 
 

(e) School text books 
 

It is also my intention to broaden the definition of farm implements by amending the regulations to 

include hay bailers, swath turners, fertilizer feeders, grasshopper bait spreaders, irrigation units and 

hydraulic lifts. 

 

These exemptions remove still further some of the regressive features of the tax. 

 

Consideration has been given to removing the tax on children’s clothing, but it has been found 

administratively impossible unless we remove it on all clothing. 

 

There is no doubt that certain persons would be prepared to sacrifice badly needed health and education 

services in order that they may gain whatever political advantage they can by their advocacy of 

removing a tax which they introduced many years ago. I am confident however, that most intelligent 

people realize that such a proposal can not be genuine, unless the welfare of the people of the province is 

to be sacrificed. 

 

Commencing April 1, therefore, it has been decided to discontinue the present Education Tax, and in its 

place to levy an Education and Hospitalization tax of 3%. It is proposed that 2/3 of the amount collected 

will be used for Education and 1/3 to meet the Hospitalization deficit. The additional $3,000,000 to be 

raised in this way will fall most heavily those best able to pay and on corporations from whom the 

province collects very little revenue at present. 

 

May I remind the house that year after year the Trustees Association and the Teachers Association, and 

last year the Rural Municipal Association, have urged us to continue with the sales tax as a principal 

source of provincial revenue.

I feel confident that when the various alternative proposals are placed before the people of 

Saskatchewan, they will agree with the recommendations I am leaving with you at this time. 

 

In closing I would like to urge all members to place the interests of the province above their political 

interests. At the present moment Saskatchewan is facing many great problems and important decisions 

will have to be made in the near future. We may be entering on an era of unprecedented development 

which will make the name Saskatchewan known all over the world. It is the duty and responsibility of 

all citizens who love their province to say or do nothing which will impede that development. 

 

At the same time, we are facing many serious problems which will require the united efforts of all our 

people in the finding of a solution. The grasshopper menace is with us again this year; the danger of 

drought is ever present on these prairies; the battle for equitable freight rates will continue throughout 

the year; the necessity of irrigation in the southwest is of prime importance; falling prices and danger of 

losing our markets is a problem of the first magnitude. 

 

I am confident that it is the wish of the citizens whose servants we are that we should unite in trying to 

find a solution to these problems. I am confident too that the budget which I have presented to you today 

will materially assist in doing so. 

 

For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I move that you do now leave the Chair. 

 

Mr. E. M. Culliton (Gravelbourg): — I beg leave to move the adjournment of the debate, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Motion agreed to and debate adjourned. 

 

The House adjourned at six o’clock p.m., without question put.
