PROROGATION 

 

[At 10:05 His Honour the Lieutenant Governor entered the 

Chamber and took his seat upon the Throne. His Honour was 

then pleased to deliver the following speech.] 

 

Mr. Speaker, Members of the Legislative Assembly. 

 

It is my duty to release you from further attendance at the 

Second Session of the Twenty-Sixth Legislature. 

 

In thus relieving you, I would like to thank you for the work 

done and the progress made. 

 

The past year has been one of global economic uncertainty. 

Although Saskatchewan has not been immune from these 

events, our province has remained strong. 

 

Members of this Assembly should be very proud that in two 

years, the provincial debt has been reduced by almost 40 

percent. 

 

In this session, the largest personal income tax reduction in 

Saskatchewan’s history was made. Because of this decision, 

80,000 people will no longer pay provincial income taxes in the 

province. 

 

A new low income tax credit was introduced to assist those who 

already pay no tax in Saskatchewan. 

 

In this session’s budget, the government made an 

unprecedented investment in infrastructure and in our 

province’s future. 

 

The budget included the largest education property tax cut ever 

in Saskatchewan. This reduced the overall amount of tax paid 

by property owners to fund education by $103 million while 

increasing K-12 education funding by $241 million. 

 

Legislation was passed that saw the creation of Innovation 

Saskatchewan. This new agency will assist in coordinating, 

focusing and supporting research activities in our province. 

 

Innovation Saskatchewan will enhance this province’s 

competitiveness and productivity, ensuring growth and 

prosperity now and in the future. 

 

The commitment to a long-term revenue sharing deal with 

municipalities has been fulfilled through the new Municipal 

Operating Grants program. This will help municipalities meet 

the needs of their communities. 

 

Members should be proud of their commitment to provide 

support to the province’s most vulnerable citizens. 

 

For years, people and groups across Saskatchewan have asked 

for a distinct funding mechanism for loved ones and friends 

living with disabilities. The wait is now over. A new, dignified, 

less intrusive income support program was put in place this 

session for those with disabilities in the province. 

 

The Governments of Saskatchewan and Canada and the 

Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations are working 

together to implement Jordan’s Principle. This child first 

approach will ensure the health and well-being of First Nation 

children with multiple disabilities in Saskatchewan take priority 

over questions of jurisdiction and responsibility of payment for 

services and health care. 

 

This session saw the first increase to the Seniors Income 

Assistance Plan since 1992. These changes will more than 

double the monthly benefit and double the number of seniors 

receiving these benefits. Our seniors built this great province 

and we must provide them with the support they need to live 

long, happy lives. 

 

The health of our people is of primary importance. That is why 

the Patient First Review was launched last year. The 

recommendations of this review were released last week and it 

is clear that more work must be done to make sure patients are

put first. 

 

The environment is of significant importance to the people of 

Saskatchewan. That is why a target of reducing greenhouse gas 

emissions by 20 percent below 2006 levels by 2020 was 

introduced last spring. 

 

The Management and Reduction of Greenhouse Gases Act was 

introduced in the last session. The legislation establishes a 

made-in-Saskatchewan plan for reducing greenhouse gas 

emissions to meet provincial targets and promote investments in 

low-carbon technologies. 

 

Our highways are the infrastructure that links Saskatchewan 

communities together and with communities outside our 

borders. A five–year rolling plan for highway renewal was 

released in the last year. Safe, well maintained highways will 

create a strong future of our province. 

 

Saskatchewan farmers and agricultural producers helped lay the 

foundations for Saskatchewan. Support programs are important 

to their future success. Agri-Stability, the former CAIS 

program, has been brought home to Saskatchewan from Ottawa 

and will be housed in Melville. 

 

Members took action to make sure criminals cannot profit from 

their crimes by passing The Seizure of Criminal Property Act 

and The Profits of Criminal Notoriety Act. 

 

Members of this Legislative Assembly should be very proud of 

introducing the Saskatchewan Scholarship of Honour. This 

scholarship recognizes men and women serving in the Canadian 

Forces and their families. All returning military personnel, as 

well as sons and daughters of soldiers killed in the line of duty 

are eligible for $5,000 scholarships. 

 

In this session, you have made sure Saskatchewan remains 

strong in light of global events and uncertainty. Fiscal prudence 

and wise investments in our province will allow Saskatchewan 

to continue on this strong path. 

 

Finally, in taking leave of you, I wish to thank you for the 

diligent manner in which you have devoted your energies to the 

activities of this session, and wish you the full blessings of 

Providence. 

 

Hon. Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, and members of the 

Legislative Assembly, it is the will and pleasure of His Honour 

the Lieutenant Governor that this Legislative Assembly be 

prorogued until later today, the 21st day of October 2009 at 2 

p.m. This Legislative Assembly is accordingly prorogued. 

 

[His Honour retired from the Chamber at 10:12.]
