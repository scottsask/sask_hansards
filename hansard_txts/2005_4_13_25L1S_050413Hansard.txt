Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to cause the government to take

is changed to ensure equal access to compensation, and to

released by the federal government. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray.

River-Watrous. 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I give notice that I 
shall on day no. 96 ask the government the following question: 
 

To the Minister Responsible for Rural Development: could 
the minister provide the expected date of the release for 
the next ACRE report? 

 
INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to 
introduce through you and to you and all members of the 
Assembly a group of 11 grade 5 students that are seated in your 
gallery, Mr. Speaker. They are accompanied today by their 
teacher, Ms. Shirley Fowler, chaperones Rick Wuchenny, Bob 
Thomas, Doreen Carrier, and Laura Berezny. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’ll be meeting with them later and we’ll be 
having our photograph taken on the steps. And we’ll have our 
meeting in 255 after they’ve toured our beautiful Legislative 
Assembly. And I’d ask all members to welcome them to their 
Legislative Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Sutherland. 
 
Mr. Addley: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It’s my 
great pleasure to introduce four guests seated in your gallery. 
And I think these are the guests that have travelled the furthest, 
the greatest distance, that I’ve been able to introduce in the 
House. If you could just give a wave as I introduce you — 
Brian Foley, Lori Foley, Ken Kavanagh, and Alice Kavanagh. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I met Brian Foley about six years ago in Costa 
Rica while we were on a co-op development tour. Members 
from all across Canada spent 11 days touring Costa Rica and 
learning about the co-ops that they have there. And he’s here 
today, as Ken is, to visit Regina and Saskatchewan as delegates 
to the Co-operators’ convention. So they still maintained his 
time in the co-operative movement. He heard a great speech by 
the Premier yesterday at their banquet. 
 
And I can see — I haven’t met him yet, I’ll go up and have a 
visit with him in a minute — but I can see that while I’ve aged 
in the six years, Brian definitely has not. So if all members 
could please give a warm welcome to our guests from

Newfoundland and Labrador. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 
 

Drake Canucks Win Provincial Championship 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well it seems that my 
constituency just keeps producing championship hockey teams, 
Mr. Speaker. The latest awards go to the Drake Canucks, who 
captured the SHA [Saskatchewan Hockey Association] 
intermediate B provincial championship in Kyle . . . provincial 
C, sorry about that, in Kyle on Thursday, March 24. 
 
After a 6-5 overtime win in Drake on Sunday, March 20, the 
team bus loaded and headed to Kyle. The entire team was 
playing at the top of their game with a very strong performance 
from goalie, Andy Bushman. The forwards and defence 
combined to play a patient and defensive game leading the team 
to a 5-2 victory. 
 
This is the first provincial C title for the Drake Canucks; that 
goes with a total of seven provincial D titles that this team has 
produced over the years. This fine Drake team defeated teams 
from Allan, Hague, Kerrobert, and Kyle in this year’s playoffs. 
It is always great to see the high calibre of hockey being played 
across our great province. The NHL [National Hockey League] 
should look to the fine quality grassroots hockey as their 
example in rural Saskatchewan. 
 
I would ask that all members join me in congratulating the 
players and coaches of the Drake Canucks upon their 
championship season. Thank you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Elphinstone. 
 

Stepping Stones Youth Rally and Career Fair 
 
Mr. McCall: — Mr. Speaker, this morning I had the pleasure 
of attending the 2005 Stepping Stones Youth Rally hosted by 
Scott Collegiate in my constituency of Regina 
Elphinstone-Centre. Mr. Speaker, about 300 enthusiastic young 
people — mostly Aboriginal — attended today’s rally. It’s the 
first part of the Stepping Stones Career Fair, which will 
complete later this month. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the rally and career fair are about providing 
positive role models for First Nations and Métis youth, about 
helping them bridge the gap between education and 
employment, and about demonstrating the big opportunities 
wide open to them. 
 
It was great to be there with the Minister of Culture, Youth and 
Recreation, herself a huge role model for young Aboriginal 
people. And it was also good to see the member from Swift 
Current there. And the former member from Cumberland was 

also there, and I have but one response to the barnburner of a 
message he delivered, and that is, egosi, egosi. 
 
Also with some fine words to say were elder, Lily Daniels; 
mayor of Regina, Pat Fiacco; File Hills Qu’Appelle Tribal 
Council Vice-Chair, Myke Agecoutay — himself a living 
embodiment of the bright future for young Aboriginal people, 
being all of 24 years old. There was Chief Glenn Pratt, Gordon 
First Nation; Chief Connie Big Eagle, Ocean Man First Nation; 
Chief Todd Cappo, Muscowpetung First Nation; and Chief 
Alphonse Bird, Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations. 
 
The powerfully well-spoken role models were Gino Odjick, 
Wavell Starr, Terrina Bellegarde, Chris Ross, Laurie Gosselin, 
Joely BigEagle-Pasapa, and Kerrie Ahenakew. A big shout-out 
to the break dancers Tyson Shepard, Allister Crowe; to the 
Scott dance team; to the wildly popular Scott Blues boys 
basketball team; musicians Terry Anne Strong Arm, Miles and 
Rochelle; and MC [master of ceremonies], Linda Anderson. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone that had something to do 
with putting on this great event. Cheers. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosetown-Elrose. 
 

Centenarian Recognized as Elrose’s 
First Honorary Citizen 

 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I want to 
tell members about another centenarian from the 
Rosetown-Elrose constituency. Jessie Wilson from Elrose is 
105 years old and remains a whirlwind of enthusiasm as she 
anticipates reaching 106 in September. Born in 1899, Jessie 
came to Canada from Aberdeen, Scotland with her family in 
1907 and lived in Moose Jaw. She married Jack Wilson, a 
World War I pilot, in 1924 and they moved to a farm near 
Wartime. In 1951 she moved to Elrose. 
 
I wish all of you could meet Jessie Wilson. She enjoyed the 
party held in her honour at the Elrose Health Centre where 
Mayor Mills declared her Elrose’s first honorary citizen. After 
receiving her medallion and certificate she said: 
 

“I don’t hear very well anymore, but what I don’t hear I 
don’t miss. I have no idea why I lived to 105. God knows; 
I don’t.” 

 
Jessie’s daughter told me Jessie started the bad habit of 
smoking at about 50 years of age, but she quit when she was 
100 because she realized it was bad for her health. She is proof 
that you’re never too old to stop smoking. 
 
Jessie Wilson is an encouragement to all including this MLA 
[Member of the Legislative Assembly]. When I arrived at her 
party the other day she looked up at me, smiled, wagged her 
finger, and said, “I voted for you.” So much for the myth that 
the Saskatchewan Party doesn’t attract support from females 
and seniors. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all colleagues in the Assembly to join me in 



2508 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2005 

congratulating an outstanding 105-year-old Saskatchewan 
pioneer who has contributed much to Saskatchewan. 
Congratulations to Jessie Wilson of Elrose. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatchewan Rivers. 
 

White Fox Credit Union Celebrates 60 Years 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this 
past Saturday night I had the pleasure of attending the 60th 
anniversary of the White Fox Credit Union in the northeast 
corner of my constituency. 
 
It was a well-attended event with over 250 credit union 
members coming together for their annual general meeting 
followed by a meal, presentations, and a retrospective slide 
show. And then we all enjoyed a concert by our centennial 
youth ambassador, Theresa Sokyrka. 
 
Mr. Speaker, credit unions are an integral part of our history, 
especially for rural Saskatchewan. In response to the 
Depression, legislation was passed here in this Assembly in 
1937 giving communities the ability to create their own 
officially chartered credit unions, and the movement spread 
from there. Today there are over 300 credit union branches in 
this province and nearly 600,000 members. 
 
The White Fox Credit Union was formed in 1945 and 
eventually joined with the Choiceland credit union. Founding 
members of both credit unions were honoured with gifts last 
Saturday night. They were James Mollison, Cliff and Thelma 
Kelsey, Mae McTaggart, Neil McTaggart, Marion McBain, 
Hedwig Lessing, Clarence Long, Alvin and Stella McBain, and 
Betty McBain. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in congratulating 
these pioneers of the White Fox Credit Union, as well as the 
present staff and board for organizing a very successful 60th 
anniversary and congratulations to the people of White Fox, 
Love, Choiceland, Garrick area for their community spirit and 
longstanding support of their credit union. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 

Appointment of Honorary Lieutenant Colonel 
of the North Saskatchewan Regiment 

 
Mr. Morgan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to ask 
members to recognize the appointment of Saskatoon lawyer, 
Bob Stromberg, to the position of honorary lieutenant colonel 
of the North Saskatchewan Regiment. 
 
This regiment has history back to April 1912 and has a proud 
service record in both world wars. The position Mr. Stromberg 
is appointed to is more than a merely honorary position. It 

serves as an important liaison representing the needs of the 
military and presenting those needs to the government and to 
the private sector. Mr. Stromberg will raise the profile of our 
armed forces and be able to put forth the needs of the military to 
the civilian population. 
 
He is well suited to this role. Mr. Stromberg has been extremely 
active in community affairs. He has played very active roles 
with Persephone Theatre, Saskatchewan Place, Pride Canada, 
the Mendel Art Gallery, and most recently as chairperson of the 
Saskatoon Airport Authority. His wide of range of connections 
in the public sector will serve the regiment and the military 
well. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Stromberg has practiced law in Saskatoon 
since 1969, a period of over 35 years, frankly something which 
I have some serious doubts about. He originally practiced law 
with Sherstibitoff Hrabinsky Stromberg and Young which later 
evolved to what is now known as Robertson Stromberg and 
Pedersen. I note that the current Justice minister articled and 
practiced with that firm; and his predecessor, Chris Axworthy, 
is now an associate of that firm. 
 
I would ask that all members recognize the achievements of Mr. 
Stromberg and congratulate him on his appointment as 
honorary lieutenant colonel of the North Saskatchewan 
Regiment. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Nutana. 
 

10th Anniversary Celebration of Francophone School 
Governance 

 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you. Mr. Speaker, last Saturday 
evening the member from Rosemont and myself had the 
pleasure of attending the 10th anniversary gala of Francophone 
School Governance in the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
It was a wonderful event, Mr. Speaker, celebrating the history 
and achievements of this important moment and component for 
the Fransaskois community. Over 400 people were there, 
including representatives from every local and provincial 
francophone association and from francophone associations 
outside our province. 
 
It was an evening filled with singing, fiddling, lots of music, 
showcasing the incredible musical talents of Fransaskois 
students past and present. There was even a 10th anniversary 
francophone education theme song called “Dix Ans de Bon 
Moments” or in English, “Ten Years of Good Times,” written 
by a class of grade 11 students from Zenon Park. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there were testimonials from a graduate from 
1995, and from this year’s graduating class presentations 
featuring students from the past and a series of historical 
reviews chronically the story of Francophone School 
Governance. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Fransaskois are a vibrant and a dynamic part 
of the Saskatchewan community. Mr. Speaker, we were 



April 13, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2509 

incredibly pleased that we had the opportunity to be part of the 
10th anniversary celebration of francophone education in our 
province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Estevan. 
 

Estevan Area Centenarians Honoured 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I too 
have had the pleasure of presenting centenarians in my 
constituency with centennial medals, certificates, and flowers. 
Those honoured today are Florence Melton, age 100, who 
resides at St. Joseph’s long-term care facility in Estevan; Ole 
Ryan, age 103, who resides at Mainprize Manor in Midale; 
Mildred Good, age 100; Mary Ehrmantraut, age 100; and Emma 
McColl, age 102 — and these three ladies reside at the Estevan 
Regional Nursing Home. 
 
Mr. Speaker, after a brief ceremony at each of these facilities, 
we socialized and had refreshments. It was wonderful hearing 
about the experiences of these people who’ve built our 
province. Everyone was so gracious. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, the Estevan Regional 
Nursing Home is home to three of the honourees. The staff 
there did a wonderful job in dealing with a situation that has 
been plaguing them for some time. They had to manoeuvre the 
wheelchairs around buckets placed throughout the facility to 
catch water that was entering the building because of a leaking 
roof. And that in itself probably brought back many memories 
for these people. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in 
congratulating and thanking these centenarians. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

Potential Federal Election Issues 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. Speaker, I’m 
not sure if you’ve heard, but the federal Liberal government 
seems to be having their share of political challenges at the 
moment, and the likelihood of a spring election is increasing 
across the country. What better time to press for a better 
equalization deal for our province than right now? 
 
Yesterday the Premier of Ontario, Premier McGuinty, began to 
make the case for that province’s fiscal imbalance. He’s asking 
for $23 billion. I think by any reasonable account the case that 
we can make is much more compelling. This should be a major 
issue in any upcoming federal election campaign here in the 
province. 
 

Today I’ll be writing to the national leaders of the three major 
parties, Mr. Speaker, and I’ll be asking for their position on a 
new equalization deal and an energy accord for Saskatchewan. I 
intend to let the people of the province know the responses I 
receive so Saskatchewan people clearly know which parties 
have the interest of Saskatchewan at heart. 
 
The Premier of Ontario plans to make this an election issue, 
federally, if one is called this year. I certainly plan to make it an 
issue, Mr. Speaker. This is no time to dither. Will the Premier 
join us in our efforts? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, I have in a file letters from 
the three respective leaders of the federalist parties, each 
declaring their position around a fair equalization deal for 
Saskatchewan. We have that. I trust that the word of the Leader 
of the Conservative Party in a letter to me is a word that stands. 
I trust the word of the Leader of the New Democratic Party. 
And I have also the opinion that was provided to me by the 
current Prime Minister. 
 
You bet, if there is in fact a federal election in this spring 
season, it will be a very significant issue for the people of 
Saskatchewan, for the Government of Saskatchewan, for this 
legislature because achieving a fair energy accord for the people 
of Saskatchewan has a great deal to do about the future of this 
province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I think the positions of the 
different parties in the last election and even since the last 
election have been highlighted by the leaders of those parties in 
different materials. The point is that during an election 
campaign, and it looks like we may be on the brink of a federal 
election in the nation, during an election campaign the federal 
parties will make clear their position. 
 
The Premier of Ontario isn’t going to wait. He is starting now; 
he is making his case for Ontario today. We would like to do 
the same thing. We would offer for the Premier to join us in the 
effort today to get an update on the positions of each of these 
federal parties. This issue is too important to wait. The Premier 
of Ontario understands that. Does the Premier of Saskatchewan 
understand that, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, the Premier of 
Saskatchewan, the Government of Saskatchewan understands 
this very, very well. And that’s why very recently we have been 
prominently featured in the Western Standard magazine over 
this, in The Globe and Mail, and the Maclean’s magazine, Mr. 
Speaker. The position of Saskatchewan is being advanced at 



2510 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2005 

every level. We have enjoyed the support of the opposition in 
our campaign to get a fair equalization deal, an energy accord 
for the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
Now if the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting today that I 
need to write Stephen Harper to find out if his position has 
changed or not, I trust the man. I trust the man when he says 
he’ll support our case. I don’t think I need to write another letter 
to him today unless he’s suggesting that perhaps they no longer 
support Saskatchewan’s case. 
 
The fact of the matter is, I have them on record, Mr. Speaker. I 
have them on record and we’re waging this campaign right 
across the country. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the difference is, for the time 
being the Government of Canada is the Liberal Party of Canada. 
That’s who is forming the government. The Premier of Ontario, 
in the press reports I have made, has indicated pretty clearly that 
he will use the pending election and the importance of votes and 
seats in his province as leverage to get a better deal on 
equalization from the federal Liberal Party. 
 
The Premier will know, if his file is full as he says it is, that the 
federal government, the Liberal Party of Canada, has not yet 
come onside with the position of his party and our party that we 
need a separate energy accord. 
 
So the question still remains. Will he now use this pending 
election, will he join us in our efforts to communicate to the 
federal government — to all the federal parties, but to the 
federal government — the importance of an energy accord and 
the impact of an energy accord with respect to a pending federal 
election? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, there is no confusion in the 
nation’s capital about the position of this Premier or this 
government when it comes to an energy accord. There is no 
confusion about that. And there have been, Mr. Speaker, some 
very significant discussions ongoing between senior officials of 
this government and senior officials of the federal government 
working towards a fair energy accord for the people of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Let me say again, I have on record the leadership of the three 
federalist parties in Canada. We are lobbying, we are pushing, 
we are taking every venue possible to get a fair accord. 
 
Mr. Speaker, a year ago we started on this challenge to right 
some of the equalization wrongs, and we were successful a year 
ago, Mr. Speaker. We were successful, even though members 
opposite call $360 million in new money table scraps. That’s 
what they called it while, in fact, we don’t see it as table scraps. 
We see it as a step and we intend to complete this journey for a 

fair accord for the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

Tobacco Control Act Litigation 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we 
were very surprised to hear the Minister of Health was adopting 
a new policy — education through litigation. The minister said 
part of his strategy with The Tobacco Control Act was to get 
sued. Well it appears his strategy has worked. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I must have missed that day in law school. Can the 
minister tell us why he prefers to be sued instead of consulting 
with people — something he promised but failed to do? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I don’t think we want to go 
into talking about my learned friend’s attendance at law school. 
 
But I think what we do want to talk about is that tobacco kills 
people. It leads to cancer. We know from the report yesterday 
that lung cancer is the number one killer of women in Canada. 
And, Mr. Speaker, we’re going to continue to work and make 
sure we use every method we can. 
 
And as far as it relates to litigation, Mr. Speaker, it’s an 
opportunity to present our position — which we think has the 
support of the people right across this province — that we want 
to reduce the use of tobacco in Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, here’s the incredulous statement 
that the minister made yesterday: we know from experience in 
the United States that a lot of the lawsuits down there ended up 
changing the tide on the use of tobacco. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in the United States there was one huge difference 
— the government was the one that was suing the tobacco 
companies. In Saskatchewan, it’s the government that’s being 
sued. 
 
Mr. Speaker, some of us on this side of the House voted for this 
legislation based on the minister’s promises that he didn’t keep. 
Instead of consultation, his strategy was to wait for the 
litigation. To the minister: why would we ever believe this 
minister again? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the nature of litigation, and I 
think that member should know about this, is that it raises the 
public attention around public issues in society. And, Mr. 



April 13, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2511 

Speaker, we don’t like to be sued. We work hard to make sure 
that we have laws that will stand the test. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, if we are, we use that opportunity to educate 
the public. We use other opportunities through our school 
system and other places. We make sure we use the federal 
marketing laws and complement them with things that we do in 
this province — all with the goal of reducing the use of tobacco, 
because we know that tobacco kills. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[14:00] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I’m waiting for the next election 
where I can see the member opposite’s brochures that’ll say, 
we’ll educate you by suing you or waiting until you sue us — 
new method of campaigning, and I’m waiting to see that. 
 
Right now we’ve got a minister that wants to get sued. We have 
the hotel association granting that wish. We have First Nations 
angry with the fact they were never consulted. Now we’ve got 
individuals forming a corporation to circumvent The Tobacco 
Control Act. This legislation has more holes than a golf course, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
The minister did not live up to his commitments on 
consultation. He misled the Assembly. People are angry, 
betrayed, or doing an end run on this legislation. Mr. Speaker, 
why doesn’t this minister go back to square one and actually 
talk to people about a smoking ban that could work and might 
have some support, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I told the Assembly 
yesterday about how the Leader of the Opposition changed his 
mind over the weekend when he got a little pressure on him. 
And, Mr. Speaker, that is . . . The will of the people of 
Saskatchewan is that they want this law to go forward. And it is 
here now, and we’re going to live with it; we’re going to work 
with it. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we know from every jurisdiction in the world that 
the tobacco companies don’t like it. And they use every method 
at their fingertips to try to challenge what we’re doing, Mr. 
Speaker. We will respond in a measured way at every level, but 
our goal is to protect the people of Saskatchewan, reduce the 
use of tobacco, and stop the number of people that it’s killing. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 

Information Services Corporation 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. That’s our 

Minister of Health — I’ve made up my mind and don’t tell me 
anything that might try and change it, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to recognize 
the fine efforts of the people who work for Information Services 
Corporation. And I’d like to thank them for posting their very 
first profit, Mr. Speaker. They’ve done the very best they could 
with . . . to make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear that the NDP 
government gave them. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this NDP government is doing a little misdirection 
play, though, with its books. They raised the fees for the 
services provided. They decreased the staff. They stopped 
paying the dividend money that was supposed to be going to 
this government from the old system. Why is the government’s 
books not telling the whole story about ISC [Information 
Service Corporation]? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, you know the 
Saskatchewan Party is unhappy when ISC doesn’t make money; 
they’re unhappy when ISC makes money. But what the report 
said that was released this morning, Mr. Speaker, was revenue 
is up, expenses are down, the corporation is making a profit for 
the first time. They paid down debt — almost $12 million, Mr. 
Speaker — and surveys show that the vast majority of 
customers are happy with the service. 
 
So revenue up, expense down, profit up, customer satisfaction 
up. Only the Conservatives could find bad news in that story, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. When ISC was 
created, this NDP government said it would continue to pay the 
nearly $12 million dividend that was provided by the previous 
land titles system. This is no longer happening. 
 
This is a heck of a way to run a business, Mr. Speaker. You 
don’t pay the bills as promised, you increase the cost of service 
to your customers, you fire a bunch of employees right after the 
last provincial election. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the taxpayers of Saskatchewan are no better off. 
Why must the taxpayers of the province continue to pay for the 
incompetent way this government changed the land titles 
system? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — You know, Mr. Speaker, I announced to 
the public two years ago that the dividend payable to the 



2512 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2005 

General Revenue Fund would be cancelled until the corporation 
was in a position to pay a dividend because we announced, Mr. 
Speaker, two years ago that we would amortize the cost of the 
corporation over the longer term. 
 
Now the member must have nothing to complain about, Mr. 
Speaker, if he’s dragging up something that occurred two years 
ago. The reality is this is a corporation, Mr. Speaker, that is well 
managed, that is making a profit, and that is providing good 
service to the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
The only issue here, Mr. Speaker, is that the Saskatchewan 
Party refuses to recognize good news. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The issue here 
is this government’s inability to keep a promise. Mr. Speaker, 
the government made a promise ISC would cover the amount of 
the dividend normally paid by land titles, almost $12 million. 
But like every other promise of this NDP government, it’s 
turned out to be worthless. 
 
Let’s talk about some of the other promises, Mr. Speaker. They 
promised to sell this technology around the world. Mr. Speaker, 
how much money was spent marketing ISC around the world? 
We know they travelled to do this. And what, Mr. Minister, Mr. 
Speaker, was the dollar value returned for those around the 
world sales? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the annual report was 
released today. And again, I announced to the public through 
the media, two years ago, that it was not a priority of ISC to do 
marketing around the world, Mr. Speaker. So there was nothing 
in the annual report released today about marketing around the 
world, but I do want to report what the report said, Mr. Speaker. 
 
It said that ISC had a net income of $8.3 million compared with 
a loss last year of $5.8 million. Revenue is up from 36.7 million 
to 44.1 million. Expenses were down from 39.5 million to 35.8 
million. And, Mr. Speaker, they made a profit and they paid 
down debt. 
 
The customers are happy. The system is working. Only the 
Saskatchewan Party is not happy with these results, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 

Funding for Community-Based Organizations 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the 

Saskatchewan Association of Rehabilitation Centres, better 
known as SARC, says that low wages are driving staff to other 
sectors, causing a high turnover rate and hurting some of the 
most vulnerable people in our society — disabled people. 
 
Last fall, SARC presented the government with a human 
resource plan which dealt with compensation, recruitment, and 
retention for staff. But the NDP’s recent budget failed to deal 
with their concerns. Mr. Speaker, SARC says the crisis in staff 
turnover will at best remain at 28 per cent but, in some 
facilities, the turnover rate is as high as 40 to 50 per cent. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the Premier: why did his NDP government fail 
to deal with SARC’s human resource plan in this year’s budget? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
First of all, I want to commend SARC on the work they’ve 
done. They’ve done a very thorough job on not only wage 
issues but training issues, recruitment issues, and a range of 
other things that are important to community organizations that 
provide services. 
 
We have been working with SARC. In fact, we helped to fund 
the study that illustrated the kind of structure that they would 
like to see in the province. 
 
We have some other partners in the CBO [community-based 
organization] funding question. One of them is early learning 
and child care centres, one is SARC, and the other is the other 
CBOs funded by government. Over this next year, my staff is 
working with these people to put together a go-forward plan on 
the CBO funding package. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, what 
SARC’s member agencies want is funding from the NDP to 
establish a baseline salary for this sector. SARC agencies 
continue to lose staff to health and education sectors because 
they cannot offer competitive wages. 
 
SARC estimates it would take about three and a half million 
dollars to provide all current employees with a competitive 
salary that would meet minimum standards. But in the budget 
there is only $500,000 allocated, not three and a half million 
dollars. Mr. Speaker, to the Premier: why is the amount 
required by SARC short by $3 million in this year’s budget? 

 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Mr. Speaker, I’m going to just outline 
some of the progress that’s been made on this issue in previous 



April 13, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2513 

budgets, and I’m sure we’ll get to what happened in this year’s 
budget. 
 
In the 1994 budget, 2 per cent; in 1995, another 2 per cent; in 
1996-97, child care wages and group homes were addressed; in 
1997, 5 per cent; in 1998, another 5 per cent; in 1999, another 5 
per cent; in 2000, 2 per cent; 2001, 6 per cent; 2002, 4.5 per 
cent; 2003, 3 per cent; and 2004, 1 per cent. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, we’ve been very conscious of this. And in all 
those years that we’ve been adding money into this area, this is 
the first time the opposition has asked a question about this. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, a 
participant impact study which was completed by SARC in the 
fall of last year says that high staff turnover hurts people with 
disabilities. It says the problems include an increase in 
accidents, cancellation of recreational and community 
programs, an escalation in challenging behaviours, inconsistent 
delivery of services, continued deterioration of support to 
individuals with disabilities. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the NDP’s inaction in this recent budget is 
preventing people with disabilities — some of the most 
vulnerable in our society — from enjoying their quality of life. 
Mr. Speaker, their turnover in staff must be addressed. To the 
Premier, Mr. Speaker: why did your government choose to 
ignore SARC’s comments? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 
my budget day presentation to the stakeholders, I explained that 
we were making some steps on equity between CBOs in this 
budget. The lowest paid workers are early learning and child 
care workers; they received 3 per cent. The next lowest paid are 
SARC workers; they received 2 per cent. And the others CBOs 
across the province, who are at a better level, received 1 per 
cent. 
 
At that time I made a commitment to them that we would sit 
down — because now of course we have the early learning and 
care sector to add to that package, and we certainly hope that 
we will continue to receive those monies from the federal 
government, whatever happens on the political front there — 
and I urge those members opposite to continue to have their 
Conservative friends in Ottawa support the early learning and 
child care funding so we can put a good package together for all 
the CBOs. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 

Ms. Bakken: — Mr. Speaker, community-based organizations 
that provide the services in our communities are invaluable, but 
they cannot continue to provide these services to some of the 
most vulnerable people in our society without adequate funding. 
Mr. Speaker, is it the intent of this government to squeeze the 
CBOs to the point where they will stop providing these 
services? 
 
To the Premier, Mr. Speaker: if CBOs cannot continue to 
provide these services because of a lack of funding, who will 
provide these services? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Again, Mr. Speaker, we work very 
closely with the CBOs and I have huge respect . . . I’ve been out 
around the province to many of the places where they are 
providing services. There’s no question that these are some of 
the most caring people you would ever want to encounter. They 
deal with very difficult circumstances, people who are very 
challenged. And I want to just today publicly thank them again 
for the work they do. 
 
But I did make a commitment, and we have had an ongoing 
relationship with them to make improvements in this area. And 
I think over this next year you will see all of that sector coming 
together in a very positive way. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Mr. Speaker, time is of the essence. How can 
the CBOs continue to provide these valuable services to 
communities if the government continues to provide inadequate 
funding? What is the intent of this government concerning 
community-based organizations? Is it the intent of this 
government to squeeze them out, to have CBOs throw up their 
hands and say, I cannot do this any longer because we do not 
have adequate funding. Mr. Speaker, is it the intent of this 
government to push the CBOs out and put the services under 
the Department of Health? 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the Premier: if the CBOs do not provide this 
service in our community, who will provide these services? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that 
we are very committed to this sector and that’s why in every 
year since 1994 — when we crawled out of the black hole left 
by the members opposite — we have provided increases. 
 
I have to tell you, if we had that 500 million interest on the 
debt, it would be a lot easier to make some of these decisions. 
And so I am not in interested in any moralizing from the 
members opposite. 
 



2514 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2005 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[14:15] 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. The Chair is unable to, the 
Chair is unable to hear the remarks and then it was doubled up 
by applause. But the floor goes to the minister. 
 
Order, please. I would like the minister to complete her 
remarks. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
want to say that we have in every year provided improvements 
— not only to wages but to benefits, to core funding to the 
organizations, to service contracts that we have with the 
organizations. I feel this issue deeply, Mr. Speaker, and I have 
made a commitment with these organizations to try to come to a 
final resolution in this next year. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, once 
again we wonder what the priorities of this government is. This 
government said that they want to provide quality of life for 
people with disabilities. They say they value community-based 
organizations while the evidence does not bear this out. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the Premier: will he correct the inadequate 
funding problem that is faced by SARC and community-based 
organizations across the province? Will he provide adequate 
funding for them? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Well thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. You know, not only have we made some of the 
improvements I’ve talked about, we’ve also improved labour 
legislation as it relates to benefits for part-time workers to 
improvements in the minimum wage. 
 
These folks who claim to be so interested have never expressed 
an interest in minimum wage improvements. They’ve never 
expressed an interest in labour standards that protect people 
working in any environment. And it’s very nice today that, after 
12 years of steady improvement, they’ve developed an interest 
in this subject. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members.
