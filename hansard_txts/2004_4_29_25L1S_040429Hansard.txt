INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana, the minister of the Public Service Commission. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 
the Speaker’s gallery today is a group of 20 public servants that 
are part of a full-day program where they get to attend to the 
Legislative Building and receive briefings from numerous 
people who work here in the Legislative Assembly. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have participants who are employees from 
Agriculture, Food and Rural Revitalization; Corrections and 
Public Safety; Culture, Youth and Recreation; Environment; 
Health; Industry and Resources; Justice; Labour; and the 
Legislative Assembly itself. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Labour is going to meet with the 
public servants — shortly after the House adjourns to go to 
committee — as well as a member of the opposition. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the government, I’d like to 
welcome all members of the public service that are here this 

afternoon. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to join 
with the minister, on behalf of the official opposition, and also 
welcome our members from the public service to their 
legislature. I hope you enjoy your tours and proceedings today. 
 
Thanks very much. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 
Coronation Park. 
 
Mr. Trew: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s my pleasure to 
introduce to you and through you to all members of the 
Assembly someone who is a friend of ours, a operative of 
Dwain Lingenfelter’s team, in fact one of the key players on 
that team, but a key observer, someone with a keen interest in 
Saskatchewan and in the goings on. 
 
I ask all members to join me in welcoming in the west gallery, 
Bob Lee. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Meadow Lake. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well with the 
brief vacation that our Deputy Premier took there was, as many 
of you know, a shuffling of some responsibilities. And in those 
shuffling of responsibilities I acquired some new staff. 
 
And I would like to introduce to members of the Assembly, and 
yourself as well, Mr. Speaker, seated in the west gallery, 
Meghan Moormann. But also seated with her is her younger 
sister, Lyndsay. And I would like to welcome her here today 
and I know that she’ll enjoy the proceedings through question 
period. So please, if you’d join with me in welcoming her. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Moose Jaw 
Wakamow. 
 

Moose Jaw Business Excellence Awards 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, last evening in Moose Jaw the Minister of Industry 
and Resources, our colleague from Moose Jaw North, and 
myself had the pleasure of attending the Moose Jaw Business 
Awards of Excellence. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there were 320 people in attendance at this third 
annual awards evening to celebrate and acknowledge the 
growing success of our Moose Jaw business community. 
 



April 29, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 821 

Mr. Speaker, I’d like to extend our congratulations to all of the 
businesses that were nominated and to the winners in each of 
the 10 categories. In the pioneer award category, it was won by 
W.J. Jones and Son; the Business Innovation Award went to 
Parkview Funeral Chapel. The Community Involvement Award 
went to Independent Medical Rehabilitation. 
 
The Customer Service Award went to The Bentley Retirement 
Community. And the Young Entrepreneur went to Ryan Budd 
at Pest Arrest. The Marketing Award went to Zeke’s Jewellers. 
And the Exports Award went to Simpson’s Seeds. The new 
business venture went to Soul Mate Home Decor. And the Job 
Creation Award went to Live Global Bid. And, Mr. Speaker, 
the Business of the Year went to Charles Vanden Broek at 
Murray GM. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it was an excellent evening and a good 
representation from all of the business community in Moose 
Jaw and the surrounding area. And I’d like to offer my 
congratulations to the folks at the chamber of commerce in 
Moose Jaw who put on an excellent evening, and to a business 
community in Moose Jaw that is growing and proving to be 
very successful, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, last night I also had the pleasure of attending the 
Moose Jaw and District Chamber of Commerce third annual 
Moose Jaw Business Excellence Awards along with the 
members opposite. 
 
These awards were formed to build a positive business climate 
through recognizing and encouraging excellence. This year 
there are 44 nominations. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, the minister has gone through all of the 
winners. But I think we should pay special tribute to the 
Business of the Year. And I’d like to just read into the record 
what the Business of the Year, what the criteria was. And it was 
open to all businesses that have been operating for at least three 
years; awarded to a business that demonstrates overall success, 
judged according to certain financial criteria — growth, use of 
capital investment, exceptional performance in exporting goods, 
job creation, stability, or community involvement. And as the 
minister has alluded to, Murray GM of Moose Jaw won this 
prestigious award. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to congratulate all of the nominees and all 
of the award winners and also the Moose Jaw Chamber of 
Commerce. My only little concern last night was seeing the 
members opposite at the dinner. And looking at very positive 
businesses, it could only make me wonder that maybe they were 
there to try and get some insight into what businesses the 
Crown Investments could invest in to compete against these 
businesses with taxpayers’ dollars. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatchewan 
Rivers. 

Volunteer Recognition Awards 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Mr. Speaker, given the importance of 
volunteerism, co-operation, and community service in this 
province, I was extremely pleased to attend the North Central 
Regional Recreation Association’s annual Volunteer 
Recognition Awards held in my constituency of Saskatchewan 
Rivers last Saturday. 
 
Mr. Speaker, over 100 people attended the ceremony to 
acknowledge the achievements and contributions of the 
recipients. It should be noted that nominations for these awards 
came from within the nominees’ own communities and so came 
from those who knew the nominees and their contributions to 
their communities best. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in the category of recreation/special services, the 
recipients of the North Central Volunteer Recognition Awards 
are Mr. Gordon Goodman of Paddockwood, Doris Medernach 
and Josephine Altrogge of Cudworth, Pauline Nemish of 
Macdowall, Joy and Eugene Mokar of Wakaw, and Lin and 
Lucille Lange of Candle Lake. 
 
Albert Blais from Debden won in the category of culture and 
heritage. Jacqueline Swiderski of Christopher Lake was the 
winner for sport. For youth, the winner was Joleen Kolla of 
Cudworth, and in the category of fine arts, the award went to 
Pat Cooley of Rosthern. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
all the nominees and recipients of the North Central Regional 
Recreation Association Volunteer Awards and in thanking them 
for their service to their communities. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 

GDP Growth 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I’m well aware of the hon. 
members’ opposite desire to take credit for things that are not 
always of their own doing. I recently heard on the radio 
Saskatchewan . . . Paul Martin talking about the four and 
one-half percent growth in gross domestic product. Lest my 
colleagues opposite get on their soapboxes too quickly, I 
wanted to do a short reality check and point out that this was a 
rebound from the drought in 2001 and 2002. 
 
Doug Elliott of Sask trends monitor said in today’s Leader-Post 
that it looks good only because it is better than the negative 
growth of 2000 and 2001, and I quote: 
 

‘We’re only two per cent higher now than we were in 
2000. We’ve grown an average of less than one per cent 
per year.’ 

 
Well as an opposition, we will always want to encourage and 
applaud economic growth. We want to make two points. First, 
it’s not as much as it appears, and I’m not sure that the 
members opposite are entitled to take credit for it, but thank 
you. And I want to point that out specifically to the member 



822 Saskatchewan Hansard April 29, 2004 

from Saskatoon Massey Place because I’m sure in question 
period he will want to raise the economic growth. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(13:45) 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 
Elphinstone-Centre. 
 

SEDA’s 2004 Historical Model Legislature 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I recently had the 
opportunity and privilege to take part in the Saskatchewan 
Elocution and Debate Society’s 2004 Historical Model 
Legislature — an event that brings students together from 
throughout the province to debate Bills in parliamentary style 
here in the Saskatchewan legislature. 
 
Mr. Speaker, participants warmed up the parliamentary debate 
and legislative procedure on the first evening by debating Bills 
based on resolutions used at SEDA (Saskatchewan Elocution 
and Debate Society) tournaments, all under the watchful eye of 
the Minister of the Environment — serving as Speaker, I might 
add, Mr. Speaker. The following day the students re-enacted the 
legislature as it was in the 1930s, debating actual Bills from that 
era and even dressing in the style of the period. Prizes were 
awarded for top parliamentarians and best costumes. 
 
Mr. Speaker, 35 students from six schools took part, and I must 
say that the quality of the debate was both stellar and 
entertaining. The top junior parliamentarians were Mitchell 
Anderson of Jonas Samson Junior High in Meadow Lake, Wudi 
Wu of Campbell Collegiate here in Regina, and Caroline Ness 
of Walter Murray Collegiate in Saskatoon. 
 
The top senior parliamentarians were Kevin Hovdestad of 
Walter Murray, Carlene Variyan of Yorkton Regional High 
School, and Paraag Trivedi of Campbell Collegiate. 
 
Whitney Skinner and Megan Tokaruk of Yorkton Regional 
High School, along with Caroline Ness of Walter Murray 
Collegiate, won for best costumes. And might I say, Mr. 
Speaker, Ms. Skinner’s top costume was “duzhe dobryy.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating 
the prize winners, the organizers, and all the participants of the 
2004 SEDA Historical Model Legislature. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Batoche. 
 

Birch Hills Racquetball Player in National Championship 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this 
week Brittany Larson, a 10-year-old girl from Birch Hills, went 
to the Junior National Racquetball Championships in 
Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Brittany will be 
competing in the 10-and-under singles, 12-and-under singles, 
and in the double girls’ category. 
 
Brittany started playing racquetball before she started school. 

She is currently in grade 5 and trains in Prince Albert with her 
coaches, Amanda Dunne, Lorne Renouf, and her doubles 
partner, Jessica Renouf. Additional playing tips come from 
mother, Dawna, and her older brother, Keegan, who also played 
racquetball at the provincial and national levels. Another 
sibling, Rachelle, who has finished grade 12 last year, will also 
be . . . who was also a competitive racquetball player. 
 
While the National Racquetball Championships are being held 
in a very scenic location, the Larsons don’t anticipate spending 
too much time sightseeing, as most of their time will be sent 
with tournament play. Congratulations to Brittany Larson, and 
good luck in your competitions at the Junior National 
Racquetball Championships. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cumberland. 
 

Saskatchewan Students Win Prestigious Scholarships 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to share 
with my colleagues that two Saskatchewan students have been 
awarded full scholarships to attend the world-renowned 
International Baccalaureate program at Lester B. Pearson 
United World College in British Columbia. 
 
One of ten United World Colleges, Pearson College, located 
near Victoria, BC (British Columbia), creates an international 
community where 200 young people from over 80 countries 
live, study, and serve the community. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the two scholarship recipients are Francis “Josh” 
Grehan from Carlton Comprehensive High School in Prince 
Albert, who received the annual provincial scholarship; and 
from my constituency of Cumberland, Mika Rai Carrière from 
Charlebois School in Cumberland House, who is the third 
recipient of the biennial northern scholarship. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the International Baccalaureate program at Lester 
B. Pearson College is an exceptional program that gives 
students an opportunity to not only excel academically, but also 
to expand their horizons by meeting students and teachers from 
around the world. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in thanking 
the sponsors of the northern scholarship program for providing 
this opportunity to northern youth, and in congratulating Josh 
Grehan and Mika Rai Carrière on their outstanding 
achievement. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Lloydminster. 
 

Results of Wide Open Future Campaign 
 

Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
During yesterday’s committee meetings, both the Minister of 
Industry and Resources and the deputy minister were asked if 



April 29, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 823 

they could point to even one business that has come to 
Saskatchewan as a result of the NDP’s (New Democratic Party) 
Wide Open Future campaign. And the answer was no. The NDP 
has blown nearly 6 million taxpayers’ dollars on this campaign, 
and they can’t point to a single business that has been attracted 
to Saskatchewan. Mr. Speaker, that’s pathetic. 
 
Will the NDP stop wasting taxpayers’ money on this 
government advertising that clearly isn’t working? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!  
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well you know, Mr. Speaker, we heard a 
few moments ago the member from Saskatoon Southeast 
getting up and saying that even though Statistics Canada said 
yesterday that growth in Saskatchewan last year was 4.5 per 
cent, that we shouldn’t celebrate that, Mr. Speaker, because he 
said we’d had some bad years. 
 
So when we start to turn the corner and build the economy, 
what do the members of the opposition do, Mr. Speaker? They 
get up right away and try to drape crepe, black crepe all over it, 
Mr. Speaker, because all they can talk about is doom and 
gloom. 
 
But I want to say to the House and to the people, Mr. Speaker, 
that notwithstanding the doom and gloom of the opposition, we 
even see in the media, Mr. Speaker, articles like this on the 
business pages. “Sask. takes export lead.” The biggest export 
growth in the country will be in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
“Provincial labour funds buck national trend.” The fastest 
growth in Canada and 4.5 per cent growth in the economy. 
We’re on a roll and we’re going to keep right on moving, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Lloydminster. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — But, Mr. Speaker, when this question was 
asked specifically to the minister and the deputy minister, 
here’s the answer. And I quote: 
 

I . . . (can’t) give you an example of . . . a project or an 
investment . . . as a result of our advertising. 

 
Mr. Speaker, $5.7 million on advertising and not one project or 
investment. That’s a pretty brutal return on investment. Mr. 
Speaker, it’s time for the NDP (New Democratic Party) to 
admit that their program is a failure. And how can the NDP 
justify blowing millions on a failing advertising campaign when 
they’re raising taxes and closing beds for seniors? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, it is a well-known fact that 
any marketing campaign — and I want to tell the member that 

many more millions of dollars are spent in other jurisdictions on 
this kind of marketing — no marketing campaign will ever say 
that a business came to a place because of they saw an 
advertisement, Mr. Speaker. It doesn’t work that way. 
 
But we know, Mr. Speaker, that in order to grow, you have to 
have a positive attitude. And what I would say to the member 
and to the House is this, Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order, please. We seem to have 
two debates going on at the same time here. I recognize the 
Minister of Industry and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — What I would say to the member and the 
House, Mr. Speaker, is this. Last year the oil and gas industry 
invested $1.9 billion in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. In the last 
five years the private sector has invested $1 billion in new 
investment in forestry projects in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
In 2003 the economy in Saskatchewan grew faster than any 
other economy in Western Canada and projections are the same 
for this year, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Lloydminster. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Mr. Speaker, nonetheless the campaign — 
the Wide Open Future campaign — has been a flop. But are the 
NDP getting the message? No, they’re not. According to their 
Web site, the NDP now plan on taking this Wide Open Future 
campaign to the US (United States), Europe, Asia. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — The minister has admitted . . . And even so, 
Mr. Speaker, the minister has admitted they haven’t brought in 
one new business to Saskatchewan; the campaign has been a 
complete flop here in Canada. Now the minister is going to start 
a world tour. 
 
Mr. Speaker, how many more taxpayers’ dollars will the NDP 
blow on this tour of the US and Asia and Europe? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, you know this story about the 
advertising in other countries is what I would call a John 
Weidlich CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) exclusive. 
This is so exclusive in fact — this plan — that it really only 
exists in the mind of a reporter from the CBC and apparently 
the opposition member as well. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I have never heard of any such plan; neither has 
the staff of the Department of Industry and Resources. The 
CBC has uncovered a plan that is so secret and devious, Mr. 
Speaker, that neither I nor my deputy nor the staff of the 
department have ever heard of it. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as I said to the member yesterday, this year’s 
budget for our Future is Wide Open campaign has been reduced 



824 Saskatchewan Hansard April 29, 2004 

to $1.4 million. And none of that, Mr. Speaker, is going to be 
spent on expensive advertising in Germany or France or Japan 
or Swaziland or any other country that may be in the 
imagination of either the . . . 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. I recognize 
the member for Lloydminster. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Mr. Speaker, the minister can dress this up 
any way he wants, but the bottom line is that the campaign 
hasn’t worked here in Canada. And I want him to commit again 
what his intentions are for this advertising outside of Canada. 
 
The NDP have spent nearly 6 million taxpayers’ dollars to date, 
and according to the department officials they’ve generated 451 
inquiries from people outside of Saskatchewan — 451, Mr. 
Speaker. That’s $12,000 per inquiry. Mr. Speaker. They can’t 
point to one business that’s moved to Saskatchewan as a result; 
not one. 
 
Now the NDP blew nearly $1 million on an ethanol plant that 
never came to Saskatchewan. They’ve blown nearly $6 million 
now attracting no businesses to Saskatchewan at all. Will the 
NDP scrap this failed program? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to 
reiterate that the assertion that this government is going to be 
spending money advertising in international markets is not the 
case, that there is no such plan, Mr. Speaker. It is a fabrication 
by some reporters and I think the bait has been swallowed by 
the member in the opposition. 
 
But I want the member from the opposition to know that 
Ontario has committed to spend $18 million over four years on 
marketing Ontario. In 2003 the Government of Ontario 
announced it would spend $128 million over two years on an 
investment attraction and tourism campaign for the city of 
Toronto to help it recover from the impact of SARS (severe 
acute respiratory syndrome). 
 
I could go on, Mr. Speaker, but my point is this: if you can’t be 
positive about yourselves and the place you live, if you’re not 
prepared to sell yourselves, you can’t expect anybody else to be 
interested in you. And that’s not where we’re at. We’re going to 
sell Saskatchewan for the great place it is, Mr. Speaker.

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm River. 
 

911 Service 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Two weeks ago 
Wayne Townsend was driving by a neighbour’s farm at 
Bladworth and spotted a fire. He did what any of us would have 
done. He dialled 911 to report the fire and requested to be 

connected to the Davidson fire department. Well what happened 
next, Mr. Speaker, was a gong show. 
 
First he was disconnected, so he called back and was put on 
hold. Then he spoke to another dispatcher and was put on hold 
again. Then he was transferred from that dispatcher to the 
RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) here in Regina, who 
was wondering why he was phoning there. They tried to help 
him, but connected him to Imperial. Needless to say, Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Townsend hung up in frustration. 
 
Firefighters finally made it to the scene 30 minutes after the 
initial 911 call. Does the minister think the 911 system is 
effective here in Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!  
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for 
Corrections and Public Safety. 
 
Hon. Mr. Prebble: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the member and to all 
members in the House that first of all, I will examine carefully 
the events that the member is speaking of with respect to this 
particular incident. Clearly there appears to have been a 
problem and I will investigate. 
 
Let me say with respect to the 911 system generally that I think 
it functions very, very well in the province of Saskatchewan, 
Mr. Speaker. We have tens of thousands of calls that are made. 
We have four public service answering points around the 
province — in Prince Albert, in Saskatoon, in Regina, and 
Lloydminster — that function very, very well. And, Mr. 
Speaker, as a result of that, within a matter of seconds 
ordinarily a call that is placed to 911 is relayed to the 
appropriate dispatch agency. 
 
Having said that, Mr. Speaker, I will undertake to examine this 
particular incident. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 
 
(14:00) 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well this isn’t simply 
a problem in my part of the province or my part of the 
constituency. Even the Battleford fire chief has raised some 
serious concerns. Fire Chief Larry Gabruch recently told the 
Battleford town council that the 911 system implemented by the 
province is, quote: “a step backwards.” A step backwards, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
According to the chief, it is the position of his department that 
this new system has added three to four minutes per call. As he 
put it, quote: 
 

It can be lots when it’s life and death. It hasn’t cost us any 
lives thus far, but eventually it will. 
 

People in rural Saskatchewan deserve a 911 system that can 



April 29, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 825 

respond to emergencies in good time. Will the minister today 
commit to reviewing the provincial 911 coverage to ensure that 
the chief’s fear that lives lost won’t be realized? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!  
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for 
Corrections and Public Safety. 
 
Hon. Mr. Prebble: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I really do not think 
that there is a need to review the 911 system in this province. 
We are constantly re-evaluating the 911 system and we will 
continue to do that. And I will be pleased to take this matter that 
the member raises up with the fire chiefs’ association in the 
province and happy to discuss it with them. 
 
But I just want to say to the member that I think he is very 
incorrect when he suggests that 911 has not made a positive 
difference in this province. I just want to assure the member and 
the public at large that 911, the new system, is responsible for 
saving many lives in the province of Saskatchewan, Mr. 
Speaker. Because what we now have, Mr. Speaker, is a system 
that, with the odd exception, results in the message that is 
coming from the caller being communicated to a dispatch 
agency within a matter of usually less than 10 seconds, Mr. 
Speaker . . .

Expenditures for Proposed Ethanol Plant 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister Responsible for Investment 
Saskatchewan. Last week, Mr. Speaker, the government 
admitted that more than $2 million was spent on the NDP’s 
imaginary ethanol project at Belle Plaine. And the NDP 
government’s share of the bill for its imaginary ethanol plant 
was at least $829,000. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I say imaginary because there never was a deal in 
place to build an ethanol plant at Belle Plaine and all that exists 
today on the site where the NDP spent 829,000 taxpayers’ 
dollars is an imaginary ethanol plant. And, Mr. Speaker, on that 
plant site, there’s two . . . a small pile of dirt and two holes 
where the signpost used to be. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the minister: why would the NDP spend 
$829,000 on an ethanol plant that never existed? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!  
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well you know, Mr. Speaker, I consider to 
be . . . our Premier to be a very capable person. But you know, 
even I do not accept that he could have cast his spell on Broe 
industries, lured them to Belle Plaine, and persuaded them to 
spend $1.3 million of their own money on an imaginary plant, 

Mr. Speaker. I don’t think American companies normally come 
up to spend money on imaginary plants. 
 
And as I’ve said to the House and I’ve said to the member, Mr. 
Speaker — and we’ve provided detailed information — we 
acknowledge that this was an effort to invest in an ethanol plant 
which unfortunately, at the end of the day despite the best 
intentions of all concerned, did not proceed. We have to 
acknowledge therefore that we spent $866,000 approximately 
on a project that will not go ahead. And I acknowledge that, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Was it imaginary? No it was not; it was entered into with the 
best of intentions, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, despite 
what the minister says, taxpayers across Saskatchewan are all 
wondering the same thing. Why would the NDP spend almost 
$1 million on a plan to build an ethanol plant where there was 
no plan in place to build it and no approval for the bank for 
financing? 
 
Mr. Speaker, despite no plan, despite no financing, that didn’t 
stop the NDP from paying contractors and consultants more 
than a half a million dollars for design work alone on what 
turned out to be an imaginary ethanol plant at Belle Plaine. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the minister: why did the NDP spend hundreds 
of thousands of taxpayers’ dollars on an ethanol project that 
never actually existed? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I have already indicated 
that obviously there was an ethanol project that existed. People 
were working for a year and a half on that project, Mr. Speaker, 
but the project never came to conclusion. It was never 
completed and we have to admit that, Mr. Speaker, but it was 
entered into with the best of intentions with a view to building 
the ethanol industry in this province, Mr. Speaker. It did not 
succeed. 
 
But I will say this, Mr. Speaker, that we have put in place a 
regulatory regime for the development of the ethanol industry in 
this province. We have private sector investments from Husky 
and also in Weyburn to join Pound-Maker in producing ethanol 
in Saskatchewan which will be mandated for use in fuel next 
year, Mr. Speaker, and which will also support the development 
of the livestock industry. 
 
On this side of the House we try to build, Mr. Speaker. On that 
side of the House . . .

826 Saskatchewan Hansard April 29, 2004 

Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. Speaker, the 
question is, how well have they done so far? The NDP, Mr. 
Speaker, didn’t stop at half a million dollars for contractors and 
design consultants. No, Mr. Speaker, the NDP also spent 
another $300,000 on more — on everything from barbecue and 
circus tent rentals to marketing, surveys, and site preparation — 
all, Mr. Speaker, for an imaginary ethanol project that the NDP 
never had a deal to build. 
 
Mr. Speaker, according to documents released by the NDP as a 
result of freedom of information request, the NDP paid a 
company called Points West Consulting $65,000 for work on 
this, an imaginary ethanol project. Mr. Speaker, to the minister: 
what services did Points West Consulting provide to the NDP 
government in return for its $65,000 fee? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — I want the member to know, Mr. Speaker, 
that the Points West company in Regina was working for Broe 
industries long before the ethanol project was even conceived. I 
believe they were consultants to Broe industries for some 
months and perhaps years before this project was conceived. 
 
My point is, Broe industries retained Points West Consulting. 
The Government of Saskatchewan did not retain Points West 
Consulting with respect to this project. All of the contractors, 
with the exception of a legal firm in Saskatchewan and one 
other, and the bus, I believe, were contracted by Broe, Mr. 
Speaker. And Broe made its choice as to its consultant, which 
was Points West, long before this project was conceived. They 
have every right to contract with whomsoever they choose, and 
they did so, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Points 
West Consulting is a company with well-known and strong 
political connections to the NDP. And as the minister has 
indicated and the NDP has indicated, that Points West was 
actually hired by Broe industries to represent the company in its 
negotiations with the NDP government on the Belle Plaine 
ethanol deal. 
 
Mr. Speaker, if Points West Consulting was already being paid 
by Broe industries to lobby the NDP government on the ethanol 
project, then what services is Points West providing to the NDP 
government on the same deal, and why are the Saskatchewan 
taxpayers on the hook? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!  
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, as I pointed out in my 
previous answer, Points West Consulting was the long-time 
consultant of Broe industries. They were also the consultant of 

Broe industries with respect to this project. 
 
The fact of the matter is that several people that work for Points 
West, who are entitled to do business in Regina regardless of 
whatever political affiliation they may have or not have, Mr. 
Speaker, were working for a year and a half in an office in 
Regina doing various things to be the Broe presence in Canada 
for this project, because Broe did not have any other office in 
Canada or Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
 
These individuals were working over a year and a half period to 
organize the project on behalf of Broe. In fact I believe they 
were paid by Broe a net total of about 139,000 because 24,000 
was paid to third parties, Mr. Speaker. For a year and a half of 
work, it was not an exorbitant amount, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Lloydminster. 
 

Out-of-Province Marketing 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to ask the 
Minister of Industry and Resources to clarify his earlier 
response about the out-of-Saskatchewan advertising under the 
Wide Open Future campaign. In the performance plan for 
Industry and Resources just printed off the Web site, for key 
actions, 2004-2005, there’s a section, and I quote: 
 

Out of Province, the campaign will become less focused 
on . . . general national business audience and more 
targeted on sector-specific business audiences and will 
expand its reach beyond Canada’s border to include key 
markets in the US, Europe and Asia. 

 
Will the minister clarify his earlier comments, please? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — I’m very happy to comment, Mr. Speaker. 
We have . . . This plan is not secret, Mr. Speaker; this plan was 
introduced with the budget. It is a public document. And, Mr. 
Speaker, we are definitely going to make efforts in key markets 
but those efforts do not include paid advertising, Mr. Speaker. 
 
We have said in our plan that we want to have articles about the 
key sectors of the Saskatchewan economy in international 
publications. We don’t intend to pay for that, Mr. Speaker; we 
intend to market Saskatchewan. 
 
We intend, Mr. Speaker, to visit AREVA, the uranium company 
in France, Mr. Speaker, which the member from Saskatoon 
Silver Springs was suggesting to me last week that we do. And I 
said we will. We’re going to visit some organizations, we’re 
going to have articles about Saskatchewan, we are not . . . 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. Yes. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 



April 29, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 827 

Crown Corporations’ Business Investments 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister 
responsible for CIC (Crown Investments Corporation of 
Saskatchewan). Yesterday the government released its policy 
on third party review of the NDP’s money-losing business 
gambles. But what we actually got was a policy that applies to 
virtually none of the NDP’s high-risk, out-of-province 
investments. 
 
For example, Mr. Speaker, the policy exempts all of the 
investments made by the NDP through Investment 
Saskatchewan. And yet the track record of that investment 
portfolio has really been quite brutal, Mr. Speaker, a litany of 
multi-million dollar losers. And the policy exempts most of 
SaskTel International’s high-risk business ventures, even 
though SaskTel has lost millions of taxpayers’ dollars on 
virtually every one of its investments since 1995. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why bring in a third policy review if virtually 
every one of the NDP’s high-risk business gambles is going to 
be exempt from scrutiny? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!  
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for 
Crown Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — The Premier announced the vision for 
Saskatchewan’s Crown sector early last September. The 
Premier indicated at the time that all future investments both in 
and outside of the province that went beyond the core function 
of our Crown utilities would be subjected to a third party 
independent review. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there has been one review that’s been undertaken 
with Navigata in terms of a future investment in Navigata. It 
was completed by a group called Wolfe; they’re 
telecommunications experts. And the group recommended that 
the government proceed with that investment, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Every out-of-province investment/in-province investment that 
goes beyond the mandate of the key Crowns will be scrutinized 
by a third party process. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, the minister’s bragging about a 
review policy that probably would not apply to NDP 
mega-losers such as the $28 million SPUDCO (Saskatchewan 
Potato Utility Development Company) loss; or the $40 million 
stock gamble on the Australian stock market; or the $7 million 
the NDP have lost in Minds Eyes Pictures. Or what about the 
$28 million NDP loss on Retx.com in Atlanta, Georgia? What 
about the $10 million loss in Craig Wireless International in 
Winnipeg or the NDP’s $17 million loss in Coachman 
Insurance in Ontario? What about the NDP’s $5 million loss on 
its dot-com in Nashville, Tennessee? 
 
Mr. Speaker, will the minister admit that the NDP’s investment 
watchdog is lame, blind, deaf, and toothless? 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister responsible for the 
Crown Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, those are extremely 
interesting comments. And, Mr. Speaker, the Sask Party 
continues its cute one-liners that don’t get at the substance of 
the issues, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Crown sector in this province has delivered 
over $1.8 billion in dividends to the General Revenue Fund, Mr. 
Speaker. That has paid for, that has paid for important public 
services like health, education, agriculture, and highways and 
transportation. 
 
(14:15) 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have reduced Crown debt by $2 billion since 
1991, when those people increased Crown debt while Devine 
was in power by over $2 billion, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we are extremely proud of our Crown 
corporations in the province of Saskatchewan. They provide 
good paying jobs. They provide head office jobs. They support 
Saskatchewan business. They give dividends. And we had the 
lowest utility rates in the country, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time is up. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!
