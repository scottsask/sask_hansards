STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition, the member for Swift Current. 
 

Swift Current Business Excellence Awards 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last week on May 17, 
myself and the MLA [Member of the Legislative Assembly] for 
Yorkton had the privilege of attending the Swift Current & 
Area Business Excellence Awards put on by the chamber of 
commerce, celebrating business excellence in Swift Current and 
area, in southwest Saskatchewan. And I think the member from 
Yorkton would agree it was a great evening, a chance to 
celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit and the business excellence 
and customer service of businessmen and women in my 
constituency. 
 
I’d like to run over if I can some of the award winners. Under 
the new business category, the Saskatchewan Landing Golf and 
Country Club won that award. It’s a great golf course at the 
provincial park just north of Swift Current. The Customer 
Service Award went to Optical Image in the Swift Current Mall. 
For community involvement, it was Re/Max of Swift Current. 
McBean Tessem Barristers & Solicitors won the Centennial 
Award, and that firm, Mr. Speaker, can trace its history 100 
years back in the community of Swift Current. The new 
Environmental Award went to Great West Auto Electric. The 
young entrepreneur was Service Master/LNS Construction. And 
the Business of the Year is a very important and long-term 
employer in Swift Current — REM Enterprises — that will be 
known to many members of this House. 
 
I’d like to also acknowledge the sponsors, Mr. Speaker: the 

Southwest Community Futures, SaskTel, SaskPower, the RBC 
[Royal Bank of Canada], Rural Development, DirectWest, and 
the city of Swift Current, as well as the key sponsor and 
long-term sponsor of these awards, Southwest Credit Union. 
 
Congratulations to the winners. And it’s a cliché, Mr. Speaker, 
but everyone there, the nominees were also winners as well. 
And we want to congratulate all of the businessmen and women 
who were nominated for Swift Current Business Excellence 
Awards for 2005. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for The 
Battlefords. 
 

North West Historical Society Honours Pioneers 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — In 1924 a dedicated group lead by 
Campbell Innes founded the Battlefords North West Historical 
Society. At that time it was stated that one of the aims of the 
society would be to honour our pioneers. Well, Mr. Speaker, the 
provincial centennial year was chosen as an appropriate time to 
recognize the pioneers of the Northwest. And as a result our 
nation builders were featured at a very special event in North 
Battleford on this past Saturday. 
 
The historical society honoured 39 individuals who have 
resided in Saskatchewan for at least 20 years, are 80 years of 
age or over, and are currently residing in the Battlefords area. 
Each individual was nominated and their stories have been 
published in a book unveiled at the event. 
 
The nominees and recipients are wonderful, nice, ordinary folk 
who have contributed greatly to the growth and stability of our 
community and our nation. The society’s newsletter represents 
them as being family people, good neighbours, helpful and 
compassionate, growers of food, soldiers, workers, merchants, 
clerks, teachers, mechanics, technicians. Each was indeed a 
nation builder and each in turn received an MLA-nominated 
centennial medal presented by yourself, Mr. Speaker, as part of 
this tribute. 
 
I ask the members of the Assembly to recognize and 
congratulate each of these 39 extraordinary people and to thank 
the executive and members of the North West Historical 
Society, particularly Walter Kostyna, Joyce George, Gil 
Bellavance, and Sarah Chomicki for their hard work and efforts. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

Aboriginal Awareness Week 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today marks the 
beginning of national Aboriginal Awareness Week. This week, 
which raises awareness of Canada’s Aboriginal people in the 
federal public service, was started in 1992. However, the 
achievements of Aboriginal people in Canada goes well beyond 
the federal public service. This week is also to recognize the 
achievements of all Aboriginal people in Saskatchewan and 



May 24, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3133 

Canada for their contributions to the communities in which they 
live and work. Understanding is a bridge to tolerance and 
respect. And celebrating this week is but one way we can 
increase the understanding between Aboriginal and 
non-Aboriginal people. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this week all Canadians can share in the 
achievements of Aboriginal people, whether it be from the arts, 
athletics, business, or Saskatchewan’s public service. It reminds 
us what a vibrant and diverse Aboriginal community 
Saskatchewan has. Saskatchewan’s public service is well served 
by hard-working, dedicated, and educated Aboriginal people. 
Their contributions to our public service and our province needs 
to be recognized. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina

Volunteers Contribute to Royal Visit’s Success 
 
Mr. Trew: — Mr. Speaker, during the course of last week’s 
royal visit, hundreds of Saskatchewan residents had the 
opportunity to meet the royal couple and thousands more 
gathered with them at official events to help celebrate 
Saskatchewan’s centennial. 
 
Mr. Speaker, from Wednesday’s visit to the First Nations 
University of Canada, where the First Nations veterans and 
peacekeepers were honoured, to the centennial gala in 
Saskatoon where 12,000 people packed the arena to see some of 
Saskatchewan’s very best entertainers, the royal visit was an 
unqualified and resounding success. 
 
One of the first stops that the royal couple made upon arriving 
in Saskatchewan was right here at the Legislative Buildings. 
And, Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity today to thank 
in particular the staff of this building who worked very hard and 
put in very incredibly long hours to ensure that the events that 
took place in this building and on the grounds went smoothly 
and were enjoyable for all concerned. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the amount of work that went on in and around 
this building was prodigious. And it was just a part of the 
overall effort and preparation for the royal visit. I ask all 
members of the Assembly to join me in acknowledging the 
thousands of Saskatchewan women and men whose hard work, 
dedication, and meticulous attention to detail contributed to the 
outstanding success of the centennial royal visit. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

Saskatchewan Debating Award 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure to rise again 
to ask the legislature to once again recognize the outstanding 
debating skills of Vinay Mysore and Kevin Hovdestad. 
 
Earlier I had the privilege of reporting to the legislature that 

these young gentlemen were the 2004 provincial champions in 
high school debating. As a result of last year’s success, they 
were chosen to compete in Oxford, England where they made a 
strong and very credible showing. 
 
Kevin and Vinay had to leave Oxford before the final 
competition to come home to defend their provincial title in 
Yorkton. There they won the provincial title and received the 
award from the MLA from Yorkton who is currently the 
Deputy Premier. The Deputy Premier said in his remarks when 
he was presenting the award that he was looking for someone to 
pass the Yorkton reins to and these debaters would be very 
good choices. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I agree. I believe that firstly, that they would be 
very capable of replacing the current member from Yorkton. 
And secondly I suspect that their political views may well make 
a difference to the balance of power in the legislature. 
 
Mr. Speaker, hard work, competence, and excellence in our 
youth is something that should always be recognized, 
encouraged, and supported. We as MLAs should encourage 
debating and parliamentary skills wherever possible. These are 
the people that will follow us, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I would ask all MLAs to join me in recognizing the hard work, 
skills, and debating prowess of Kevin Hovdestad and Vinay 
Mysore.

Walter Murray Collegiate Students Recognized for 
Outstanding Achievements 

 
Ms. Junor: — Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate two students 
from Walter Murray Collegiate in my Saskatoon Eastview 
constituency for their achievements over the last few weeks. 
 
Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago I told the Assembly about 
Kimberly Richards, a grade 10 student at Walter Murray who 
was one of only eight Canadian students competing in the Intel 
Science and Engineering Fair recently held in Phoenix, 
Arizona. This is the largest science fair in the world, and I’m 
pleased to say that Ms. Richards placed second in her category, 
winning a $2,000 prize and receiving an offer to have the 
results of her study on the crop disease fusarium head blight 
published in the American botanical journal. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, Raymond Ko, a senior at Walter Murray, has 
been awarded a $60,000 TD [Toronto Dominion] Canada Trust 
Scholarship for his outstanding academic ability and his 
community leadership. He is one of only 20 scholarship 
winners out of 3,600 applicants from across Canada. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Raymond Ko is a talented musician who uses his 
outstanding musical ability to work with children with autism 
through the school’s charity, Autism Treatment Services of 
Saskatchewan. He also volunteers with the Heart of the City 



3134 Saskatchewan Hansard May 24, 2005 

Piano Program, teaching underprivileged children to play piano. 
Mr. Speaker, Raymond was also involved with the Aventis 
Biotechnology Challenge and took third place in the Saskatoon 
region for his genetic analysis of a cell division control gene. 
 
I ask the members of the Assembly to join me in congratulating 
Mr. Ko and Ms. Richards on their achievements and in 
recognizing Walter Murray Collegiate for fostering what is 
clearly an extremely positive environment for its students. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

Recognition of Home Care/Special Care Aide Graduates 
 

Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, a week 
ago my wife and I had the pleasure of attending the Home 
Care/Special Care Aide graduation in the community of 
Whitewood. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this program has been going on for the last eight 
years, and it is a program, Mr. Speaker, that has seen numerous 
men and women graduate from the program. And from this 
program, Mr. Speaker, what we have seen is men and women 
have graduated in the area providing care to seniors and people 
with disabilities in our constituencies and certainly in our 
communities. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this program has been moved forward under the 
instruction of Minerva Scammell, a lady with great personality, 
just a bubbly individual who knows the program very well and 
does an excellent job of instructing in the program. 
 
This year, Mr. Speaker, there were 14 graduates who graduated 
from the Special Care Aide program. And I would like to 
congratulate the graduates, but I would also like to 
acknowledge the work of the Southeast Regional College. It’s 
because of the college and because of their recognition that the 
programs of this nature can be offered in communities like 
Whitewood and Moosomin and smaller centres in the area. And 
as a result of their recognition, Mr. Speaker, 14 more 
individuals have been able to graduate from a very worthwhile 
program. 
 
I would also like to acknowledge the fact that the Southeast 
Regional College is expanding its efforts and its work in 
offering programs in the Whitewood and Moosomin 
constituencies. So congratulations to everyone involved. Thank 
you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Notification of Psychiatrist’s Patients 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, three 
months ago today, February 24, the Minister of Health found 

out that patients in the Weyburn and area who are suffering 
from some mental illness issues had been seeing a phoney 
psychiatrist, a psychiatrist that had nothing but bogus 
credentials. What actions did the Minister of Health take at that 
time? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the opposition says 
one thing and the facts say another. This particular, this 
particular individual that’s involved has been a certified 
psychiatrist in a number of places across the world. But he . . . 
And his credentials were such that he was a practising 
psychiatrist for a number of years. But he was involved with 
some fraud around research that he was doing, and his 
credentials were taken away. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the process that went through with the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons, they spent a long period of time going 
over the particular credentials. What they didn’t pick up was the 
fact that he had been subsequently suspended and removed 
from the field. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, this psychiatrist that we’re 
talking about had been found with fraudulent activities in many 
other countries and other provinces already, Mr. Speaker. 
Clearly the minister should have taken steps immediately to 
notify patients, should have notified patients not just the fact 
that this psychiatrist had been released of his duties but the 
reason why he had been released of his duties, Mr. Speaker. 
 
This psychiatrist had been, over the last few months, in the 
Weyburn and area misleading patients. He had the ability to 
prescribe medication and drugs for patients suffering from some 
mental illness issues. 
 
But he choose to do nothing, Mr. Speaker. Why would he put 
people in the Weyburn and area in jeopardy defending a 
psychiatrist of this nature? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, once again the opposition 
says one thing and the facts are another. This particular 
individual was identified as having no longer qualifying clinical 
credentials on February 15. And immediately the Sun Country 
Health Region took the steps to make sure that patient safety 
was not compromised in any way. Another psychiatrist was 
given all of the files that this particular doctor had used, and he 
went through and made sure that all of the kinds of treatments 
that had been done had been followed and treated appropriately. 
 
We have a conflict here between patient confidentiality and 
how we make sure that there’s patient safety upheld. And so it’s 
not appropriate for me or for the officials in the department to 
go into a doctor’s files and look at the patients. But another 



May 24, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3135 

psychiatrist did that and followed up. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, these are very serious 
allegations. The very vulnerable patients in this area were 
treated by a phony psychiatrist. They had possibly been 
prescribed medication incorrectly. There have been possible 
issues around diagnosis that were made incorrectly. And yet the 
minister has done nothing. 
 
It’s interesting. Is he more interested in the fact that if he went 
public with this information, he was worried about lawsuits, or 
is he trying to cover something up, Mr. Speaker? Why didn’t he 
notify the patients of the nature of this psychiatrist? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, appropriate procedures were 
followed to have another psychiatrist review all of the files 
involved. And this was done immediately when the problem 
was identified by the College of Physicians and Surgeons 
whose job it is to monitor the professional status of physicians 
in this province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Sun Country Health Region, using this 
particular procedure, was able to make sure that the patients’ 
care was not compromised and also to protect the privacy of the 
patients. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, that answer is unacceptable. 
The patients should have been notified. Three years ago, 71 
patients that were examined by a contaminated endoscope were 
notified in Saskatoon of the possibly of contracting 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These patients were informed of the 
risks. They were all tested. 
 
And this case is very similar, Mr. Speaker. The minister did the 
right thing in Saskatoon by notifying the patients and making 
sure the corrective steps were taken. Mr. Speaker, he hasn’t 
done this in the Weyburn area. Why not? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the professionals involved 
here — the doctors who are part of the College of Physicians 
and Surgeons, the other psychiatrists, and the supervising 
psychiatrist in the particular region — took the appropriate 
steps as they deemed appropriate in this particular situation to 
protect the privacy of the patients, but also to make sure that 
they had not received any kind of adverse treatment. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, there has been an arrest 
warrant issued for Ashoka Prasad. Why didn’t the minister 
make the public aware of this doctor? There has been a warrant 
issued for him. He has done the same work in India, Australia, 
and BC [British Columbia], that has been fraudulent. Why 
hasn’t the minister . . . Was he more interested in protecting 
himself from embarrassment as opposed to finding out and 
arresting this fraud in Saskatchewan? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, my understanding is that the 
arrest warrant that’s been issued has been issued by 
Immigration Canada, so that they will be on their records for 
immigration when all of this . . . when this man comes back it 
can be dealt with. 
 
What I can say, Mr. Speaker, is that in this particular instance 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the people whose 
job it is to review credentials say that this person did have and 
does have psychiatric treatment capabilities as a psychiatrist, 
but that in subsequent years he was involved in doing research 
in psychiatry. And a number of the projects he was involved 
with were deemed to be fraudulent. 
 
It doesn’t undermine his original training, but what it does mean 
is that he cannot be qualified to practice in Saskatchewan once 
that was discovered. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, this doctor was unable to 
practice in India. He was unable to practice in Australia. He was 
unable to practice in British Columbia and now Saskatchewan. 
And what do we do? He’s unable to practice here, but let’s turn 
him loose on somebody else, Mr. Speaker. This person needs to 
be brought to justice, Mr. Speaker. 
 
It’s not a cover-up. It’s not an embarrassment. Deal with the 
issue. First of all notify the patients and then deal with this 
doctor accordingly. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, this man has been dealt with 
according to the professional advice of the College of 
Physicians and Surgeons and of the other psychiatrists. And 
what has been done is that he’s been identified internationally 
through the immigration system in Canada as to the particular 
problems that he has here. 
 
What this particular case identifies for all Canadians is the issue 
around how do we assess and acknowledge foreign credentials. 
Mr. Speaker, this is part of a national task that we have as 
ministers of Health and there are many people working on a 
new credentialing system so that this kind of thing will happen 
less frequently.

Provincial Fuel Tax 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
the city of Vancouver gets a portion of the province’s fuel tax to 
pay for its transit service. Four cents a litre is dedicated to 
Vancouver. And Ontario municipalities with public transit 
systems get 2 cents a litre of the provincial gas tax. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why don’t Saskatchewan municipalities receive a 
dedicated portion of the provincial fuel tax? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Government Relations. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
appreciate the opportunity to answer the question. The long and 
the short of it is the city of Vancouver has the ability to levy an 
extra tax, and that’s the dollar value that is provided for transit. 
They charge an extra tax. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Wood 
River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Speaker, let’s look at some 
other jurisdictions. Manitoba municipalities get 2 cents a litre 
from the provincial fuel tax for infrastructure improvements. 
Calgary and Edmonton each get 5 cents a litre from the 
provincial Alberta gas tax. Yet here in Saskatchewan the money 
goes into general revenue. 
 
Mr. Speaker, again to the minister: why don’t Saskatchewan 
municipalities get a dedicated portion of the gas tax? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Government Relations. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Again the opposition says one thing and the facts say something 
different. The Government of Saskatchewan has always moved 
the gas tax into general revenue, and from general revenue we 
have provided additional money to municipalities through 
revenue sharing. 
 
The hon. member opposite knows that revenue-sharing grants 
have increased over the last four years by 54 per cent. We are 
transferring some of our gas tax money to our municipalities. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Wood 
River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the minister should 
look at his own document. Revenue sharing — zap — was 
froze this past budget. Northern municipalities, zero. City 
municipalities, zero. Rural municipalities, zero. How can the 

minister say that there is that much fuel tax going into it? 
 
Mr. Speaker, Ontario thinks it’s a good idea to give 
municipalities a portion of the gas tax. All of the Western 
provinces except for Saskatchewan think that it’s a good idea to 
give a portion of the gas tax to municipalities. Why does this 
minister need a different system? Or is this NDP government 
just trying to keep control over the money that could be more 
effectively and efficiently used by municipalities? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[14:15] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Government Relations. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And 
pardon me if I say I’m very happy to hear the member opposite 
say NDP [New Democratic Party] government because if 
there’s one thing that makes me happy in the morning is waking 
up knowing that the NDP is the government of this province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And 
I think if the member opposite had listened last week to the . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Minister of Government 
Relations. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. If 
the members opposite had listened to the Minister of Highways 
last week when he was answering questions about roadwork in 
the province of Saskatchewan, they would know that a full $34 
million worth of the gas tax is provided to municipalities and 
others in the province for road and highway improvements, Mr. 
Speaker.

Nursing Resources for Intensive Care Units 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last week I received in 
my constituency office in an unaddressed envelope a package 
that I believe to be from local nurses at the Swift Current 
hospital. Part of the package was a memo to the nursing staff 
from the health region, the Cypress Hills Health Region. The 
memo outlines how nurses will be asked in Swift Current to 
cover the intensive care unit even though they are not trained in 
the area. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of Health: why are nurses in that 
district, in our region in southwest Saskatchewan or in any other 
region, asked to cover for ICU [intensive care unit] whether or 
not they are trained to do so? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, in the Cypress Health 



May 24, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3137 

Region there were two incidents last fall, once on October 1, 
2004, and another time for two hours on December 14, where 
an RN [registered nurse] went in to replace somebody who 
wasn’t able to come in in the ICU. This was done with very 
specific instructions that they would only work to the capacity 
that they had. They would cover until somebody else could 
come in. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is not clearly an optimum situation, but when 
you have people there and you require help, then you get 
another RN to come and cover that. This happened these two 
times in the Cypress Health Region. They are now having a 
review, and this is being sorted out. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, the memo to the nurses says and I 
quote: “At no time is an RN, even those in ICU, asked to 
perform duties that are not within their scope of practice.” 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, that’s all very well and good. But what 
happens if the situation arises in the IC [intensive care] unit in 
that hospital or anywhere else in the province where this might 
be happening and the nurse is asked to do or required to do 
something outside of her training or that scope of practice — 
his or her training. Do they sit and watch, Mr. Speaker, or do 
they indeed attend to patients and undertake some activities that 
may be beyond a scope of practice or their training for ICU? 
 
It’s a terrible position to put nurses in. It is a terrible position to 
put patients in, in any hospital here in the province of 
Saskatchewan. I want to know from the minister what does he 
intend to do about it. 
 
We have districts across the province that are staffing with 
more and more casual hirings instead of full-time nurses in 
hospitals where we need them. What is the minister doing about 
situations like we see in Swift Current? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, well frankly, we’ve been 
doing many things to make sure that we provide adequate 
health care right across the whole system. 
 
And in this particular situation, when this issue arose and was 
identified last fall, they have a nursing advisory committee in 
the region, and they’ve been working together with the staff and 
with others as to how to meet this particular concern. And one 
of the things that is a challenge down in the Cypress region, in 
the Swift Current area, is that there are not sufficient numbers 
with this training. And so we are now in the process of working 
with SIAST [Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and 
Technology] to create a course that would be taught in the 
Cypress regional college to provide that extra training for 
critical care nurses. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when the problem’s identified, we sit down, sort 

out how we can solve it, and then go to solve it. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the minister says a problem 
identified last fall — if you take him at his word — that they’ve 
been sitting down and trying to resolve that. This current memo 
asking nurses to cover in ICU, whether or not they’re trained, is 
dated April 29 of this year. It’s not from last fall. The headline 
of the memo is “ RN coverage.” 
 
So to the extent the minister has said they were going to do 
something about a problem last fall, it’s happening again. 
That’s why nurses have sent me a letter as well. They are 
protesting this decision that has put them in, in terms of their 
ICU care. The nurses say there are many skills that are unique 
to the ICU. In the letter they say, and I quote: “It is impossible 
to safely give a crash orientation course especially if the IC unit 
is busy.” 

 
Mr. Speaker, why is that minister putting nurses in Swift 
Current or anywhere in that situation? And why is he putting 
patients in that situation? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, first off I would like to 
correct the member opposite’s reading. I’m not sure if he, he 
normally needs some assistance. But the day of this memo is 
March 29, 2005. And this particular memo comes as a result of 
the discussions that took place related to the incidents in the 
fall. And this is setting forward a plan if in fact something does 
arise, this would be the procedures that follow. 
 
But the longer term plan is to train more people in that region so 
it won’t be a problem. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well if the minister is 
saying that this is not going to happen any more in Swift 
Current or in any other hospital where nurses are asked to do 
what they’ve been asked to do in the Swift Current Hospital, he 
ought to say so because that is not what this memo from the 
health district implies. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the letter signed by nurses questioning this 
decision and questioning this direction from the health region 
goes on to say, and I quote, “As we are all bound by our code of 
ethics” . . . These are the nurses saying this: 
 

As we are all bound by our code of ethics and our 
commitment to best nursing practice, we find that your 
solution to RN coverage in the intensive care unit is not in 
the best interest of patients and the staff involved. 



3138 Saskatchewan Hansard May 24, 2005 

Mr. Speaker, the nurses understand this practice is putting 
patients at risk, Mr. Speaker. And the nurses want to see it 
changed, not with memos. They want to see full-time positions 
for nurses. 
 
Will the minister act on what the nurses in Swift Current are 
saying? Or is he willing to continue to put them in the position 
he’s put them in and to also put at risk patient care in Swift 
Current? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I’m sorry that the facts don’t 
fit with the script that the member opposite has because he 
keeps getting wound up like he’s in some kind of a play where 
it has no relationship at all to the facts. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there were two incidents in the fall that were 
identified. People who were work there, working together with 
the nurses and the nursing managers have set out a plan 
whereby if this kind of a situation arose again, the rules are 
going to be there as set out in the memo. But the goal is to train 
more people in the critical care nursing course so that we will 
have more people available to make sure that the coverage is 
not a problem at all.

Mandatory Testing and Disclosure (Bodily Substances) 
Legislation 

 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, last week, Bill 102, The 
Mandatory Testing and Disclosure (Bodily Substances) Act 
received approval in the Human Services Committee. There 
was strong support for this Bill from members on both sides of 
the House. What concerns me is that the minister indicated that 
he had not yet instructed his officials to draft regulations. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the minister: when will the minister have 
regulations drafted so that this Bill could be proclaimed into 
law? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, it is our intention to have 
this Bill proclaimed this year. And that will make this the first 
such legislation in the country, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member from 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, there’s been strong pressure 
from police officers, firefighters, first responders, and others for 
this legislation. The opposition has indicated that it is highly 
supportive of this legislation and in fact had drafted a nearly 
identical private member’s Bill earlier this year. 

Front-line workers are depending on this government to ensure 
this Bill becomes law as soon as possible, but now the minister 
tells us it might be some time later this year — I repeat, might 
be some time later this year. Mr. Speaker, to the minister: how 
about this month? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Again, Mr. Speaker, this is a priority 
for this government. Nova Scotia has passed similar legislation 
which I understand they still have not proclaimed, Mr. Speaker. 
Again, when we proclaim this legislation this year, we’ll be the 
first in the country to proclaim this type of legislation, this 
specific type of legislation, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Consultation is very important in respect to the medical 
profession and how some details on this legislation are going to 
work, Mr. Speaker. That’s the process. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, it’s an issue of basic competence 
on the part of the government. Here we have, before this 
Assembly, a Bill that was supported by all parties and all 
stakeholders. This is something that does not happen every day. 
 
And now, Mr. Speaker, we have a minister who hasn’t gotten 
around to drafting regulations to accompany this Bill. When can 
we expect this minister, when will he finally get around to 
drafting regulations that can be proclaimed into law, giving first 
responders the peace of mind that they deserve? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, there was as much delay 
getting this into committee as there will be in drafting the 
regulations. 
 
You know, for the interest of the members and for the interest 
of the members of the public, I mean this legislation did not go 
straight to committee. It was adjourned in the House so that the 
members opposite could consult with the people they say they 
support and could make sure they really support the legislation 
they support, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Now we want legislation that works. And it’s going to take 
some time to consult with people who are involved in actually 
using this legislation, Mr. Speaker. It’s going to take some time 
to consult with the medical profession and people who are 
going to actually be responsible for making sure this legislation 
works. That’s why we don’t proclaim legislation the day we 
pass it, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 



May 24, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3139 

Saskatoon Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, police officers, firefighters, first 
responders, health care workers are people that regularly and 
routinely put their lives on the line for the rest of society. Mr. 
Speaker, those people deserve to have some legitimate support 
from this government, and it’s not appropriate for that minister 
to stand up and say he’ll be several months or several years to 
come up with regulations for this. Mr. Speaker, these people 
deserve an answer, and they deserve it right away. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there is no reason why this minister cannot 
instruct his staff to come up with regulations immediately. Mr. 
Speaker, when will the minister come up with regulations that 
will satisfy the legitimate needs of people who put their lives at 
risk for the rest of society? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Well, well now, Mr. Speaker, now it’s 
going to be several years; according to the member from 
Saskatoon Southeast, it’s going to be several years. I don’t 
know where he gets that from, Mr. Speaker. The more 
co-operation we have in preparing these regulations and the 
people that are involved in actually implementing and using the 
Act, the quicker it will be done, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The House has my undertaking that this legislation will be 
proclaimed before the end of this year. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 118 
 
[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Forbes that Bill No. 118 — The 
Saskatchewan Watershed Authority Act, 2005 be now read a 
second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 

[14:30] 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s 
certainly a privilege to enter into the debate on Bill 118 dealing 
with the Watershed Authority. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as we all know, water is one of the essentials of 
life and therefore it is very important to all citizens of this 
province and to citizens of the world, Mr. Speaker. And it is 
becoming an increasingly emotional issue that people are 
paying more attention to every year, it seems. 
 
We only have to look back to recent events happening at 
Waterton and then some of the issues surrounding the North 
Battleford situation where the drinking water was contaminated 
with waste water, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And so anything that this government does dealing with water, 
the quality of drinking water, watersheds which directly impact 
on the quality of drinking water is, I think, it’s only incumbent 
on the opposition and the opposition Environment critic to take 
their time to deliberate, look, read the Bill through, look at the 
issues that the Bill addresses, and make appropriate comments, 
Mr. Speaker. And we certainly have done that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
As I said, maintenance of the watersheds of our province are 
very important. We must ensure that we pay attention to the 
quality of the waters in our lakes and rivers and take the 
appropriate measures to protect, maintain, and improve the 
quality of the water, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Water is not only important for our daily use as far as drinking 
water which is, of course, the most important. We require . . . 
each one of us require a quantity of water for our own daily 
needs. But, Mr. Speaker, water is also very important in our 
society today. It’s one of the necessities, and a very important 
necessity in value added in preparation of our food products 
from the farm to the plate, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I need only to think of the poultry processing plant in Wynyard 
which was in my constituency, Mr. Speaker. And a continuous, 
constant, assured supply of good quality water, Mr. Speaker, 
was essential to that industry. Without it that industry wouldn’t 
be there. 
 
And the management of our water resources is one of those 
areas, Mr. Speaker, that governments — all governments across 
this province — must take very seriously and pay particular 
attention to. As I said earlier, when things aren’t done properly 
we run into problems like we saw in North Battleford. The 
government needs to react to the situations, put measures in 
place that prevent such things happening again. And, Mr. 
Speaker, it’s not only the government’s responsibility. It’s the 
responsibility of all the citizens of our province. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, there’s a group of individuals in my 
constituency who take this responsibility very seriously. 
There’s a group of citizens along Last Mountain Lake who, 
since 2002 when we had some problems with water quality in 
that lake — where we saw effluent coming from Regina’s waste 
water treatment facilities back up into the lakes at levels that 
were higher than usual and caused some problems with the 
quality of water in that lake — a group of citizens banded 



3140 Saskatchewan Hansard May 24, 2005 

together and formed what they called . . . They called 
themselves the Last Mountain Lake Stewardship Group. 
 
And what this group does, Mr. Speaker, is they monitor the 
quality of the water. They look at the riparian areas. They 
inform themselves as to what they as citizens can do and what 
the various interest groups in our province can do — whether 
that be government, whether that be industrial users, recreation 
users, Mr. Speaker — so that they have a quality of water in 
that lake that is suitable for recreation facilities, suitable for 
fishing activities, and so on. 
 
And so what this group does is they sample the water at nine 
different locations. They are planning on expanding that, Mr. 
Speaker, and as they get more volunteers coming on board . . . I 
was just made aware of, they have had a number of workshops 
and the next workshop planned for that group will take place in 
July and they will . . . bringing in a noted speaker who will 
advise them and make them aware of further issues that they 
should be looking at. 
 
And I think groups as this . . . And I’m sure there are other 
groups around the province that are taking on this type of 
activity and that type of responsibility. And I think we need to 
acknowledge those groups and applaud them for taking the 
initiative to deal with the situation, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Another part of this Bill, Bill 118, deals with how the 
Watershed Authority will deal with drainage disputes and 
diversion of water and use of water in rivers, lakes, and streams. 
And that is an area, Mr. Speaker, again that is very emotional. I 
can recall having to . . . shortly after being elected, getting calls 
from constituents who were very concerned about drainage that 
was happening in their area. And dealing with that issue, I could 
see the emotion on each side, Mr. Speaker. And in fact 
sometimes that emotion boils over into anger, and sometimes 
we see some very inappropriate actions being taken by 
individuals, all dealing with water and its use of water, Mr. 
Speaker. So if this Bill has some provisions in it that will help 
address those situations, we would certainly be pleased to 
support them. We will certainly deal with those specific issues, 
Mr. Speaker, in committee. 
 
Another area that the Bill deals with, Mr. Speaker, is the 
licensing of drilling contractors, water well drilling contractors, 
and the collection of groundwater data. And this is, particularly 
the collection of groundwater data, is a hugely important topic, 
Mr. Speaker. I have some personal experience in that, and I 
know many people around the province who don’t have a ready 
supply of good water on their property have had to deal with 
finding water. And if you don’t have proper data and if you 
don’t know where the aquifers are located, how deep they are, 
what the quality of the water is in those aquifers, Mr. Speaker, it 
can be very costly and very counterproductive. 
 
So if we are taking measures to enhance the collection of data, 
Mr. Speaker, and are dealing with the registration of contractors 
and their equipment so that when wells are being drilled that 
they are done properly, that the data is being collected at the 
same time, I think that certainly is important, and we would be 
happy to support those measures. 
 
We have a number of questions surrounding this Bill, Mr. 

Speaker, but I think most of those questions can be dealt with in 
committee, so I would move that this Bill be moved to 
committee, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is a motion 
by the Minister of the Environment that Bill No. 118, The 
Saskatchewan Watershed Authority Act, 2005 be now read a 
second time. Is the Assembly ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. 
 
Deputy Clerk: — Second reading of this Bill. 
 
The Speaker: — To which committee shall this Bill be 
referred? The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — I move that Bill 118, The Saskatchewan 
Watershed Authority Act, 2005 be referred to the Standing 
Committee on the Economy. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of the 
Environment that Bill 118 be referred to the Standing 
Committee on the Economy. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly 
to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. This Bill stands 
referred to the Standing Committee on the Economy. 
 

Bill No. 123 
 

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Forbes that Bill No. 123 — The 
Wildlife Habitat Protection Amendment Act, 2005 be now 
read a second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’m 
certainly pleased to be able to enter into the debate of Bill 123, 
and by its number, Mr. Speaker, you would realize that this Bill 
was introduced very late in the legislative calendar. 
 
And therefore as I’d said in the earlier . . . that it is the 
opposition’s duty to scrutinize legislation, understand its 
implications, and gain a comfort level with what the 
government is proposing. And we certainly have attempted to 
do that, Mr. Speaker. We have asked the minister for 
explanations of what is intended because the Bill is very brief, 
Mr. Speaker. It’s only a little more than a page. It deals mostly 
with repealing and adding various clauses, Mr. Speaker. When 
you look at the explanatory notes, it talks about various land 
descriptions and so on. 



May 24, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3141 

And we certainly needed to get a sense of what this Bill is 
doing, and in no way, Mr. Speaker, was that intended to delay 
the passage of this Bill. And certainly we feel that we would not 
be doing our duty, Mr. Speaker, if we didn’t take the time to 
scrutinize the legislation, understand it, ask questions about it, 
and then make our decisions on it. 
 
And certainly we have a number of questions dealing with this 
Bill, Mr. Speaker. But once again I think those questions, 
particularly surrounding the 2,000-plus hectares of land that are 
being removed from wildlife habitat protection for the purposes 
of specific land claims surrounding Mistawasis Reserve, we just 
need to have some questions answered in that whole area, plus 
one or two other questions. 
 
And I think we certainly can accomplish that in committee, Mr. 
Speaker. So therefore I would move that this Bill move to 
committee. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion moved by the Minister of the Environment that Bill 123, 
The Wildlife Habitat Protection Amendment Act, 2005 be now

The Speaker: — Motion is carried. The Chair recognizes the 
Deputy Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 
order to expedite the work of the committees, the Economy 
Committee and the Human Services Committee, I move that 
this House do now adjourn. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Government Deputy 
House Leader that this House do now adjourn. Is it the pleasure 
of the Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 

The Speaker: — Motion is carried. This House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 1:30 p.m.
