ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I would 

like to introduce to you and through you to the rest of the 

Assembly, a group of school students from Senlac.  There are 

17.  They are from grade 7, 8, and 9 and their teacher Kyla 

Webster is with them.  Chaperons are Sharon Moncrieff, 

Shirley Forbes, Marilyn Lodoen, Don Walker and Daryl 

Houser. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would like to say at this time it's really a 

pleasure for me to introduce students from my area because 

this school is almost at the Alberta border.  And that's a long 

trip and I'm sure if we were closer, we would probably get 

more students here. 

 

I will be meeting with the students for pictures and some 

refreshments. And I would like all the Assembly to help me 

give them a warm welcome to Regina. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Kluz: -- Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce to you and 

through you to all members of this Assembly, a delegation of 

10 Saskatchewan grade 11 students.  They are seated in your 

gallery, Mr. Speaker. 

 

They will be attending the interchange on Canadian studies 

conference which will be held in Whitehorse this year.  The 

leaders of this delegation are Paul Hildebrand and Len Brhelle. 

 

Being the caucus committee chair on local government 

education, I have been asked by the Department of Education 

to meet with them for pictures, refreshments, and questions.  I 

ask all members to welcome them here today. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

ORAL QUESTIONS 

 

Size of Provincial Deficit 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Mr. Speaker, I'd like to address my first 

question to the Premier.  Mr. Premier, you knew.  On October 

9, 1991, in the first days of the election campaign, you said, 

and I quote:  You could total up all the debts from 1905 to 

1992 together and they are not as large as this debt.  So you 

knew. 

 

But in the same breath, on the same talk show, you made the 

following promise, and I would have a brief quotation:  The 

answer is, no user fees.  User fees for medicare have been tried.  

Thatcher and the Liberals tried it.  All that it did was penalize 

those that could least afford and need medical services. 

 

You said both, and you knew about the huge debt and that you 

would not impose user fees.  And you said it on 

CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) radio October 9, 

1991. 

 

Mr. Premier, are you now claiming that someone was 

impersonating you and that it was not really you who claimed 

to know the full extent of the deficit crisis? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- No, Mr. Speaker, I do not claim that 

somebody was impersonating me.  So far as I know, the best 

impersonator of me is me; so it was me. 

 

With respect to the question . . . I expect fully that the House 

Leader for the Conservative caucus will probably dispute that 

statement too.  It was me. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I want to -- and I will at the end of question 

period -- table for the Members of the Legislative Assembly 

and for the journalists and for the public, correspondence dated 

September 22, 1991 from myself to the then premier, Grant 

Devine -- I'm reading from the letter -- where I say in the letter 

about the forecast deficit of $265 million, quote: 

 

 There is only one acceptable solution to this problem . . . We 

should agree immediately on a panel of independent 

accounting experts, who will review the current review and 

expenditure projections of the Department of Finance, take 

into account the cost of the recent flurry of pre-election 

announcements, and provide the people of Saskatchewan 

with an independently-verified financial statement in advance 

of election day. 

 

I received then a response by the then minister of Finance, who 

says this, quote: 

 

 As you can see, there are numerous factors at play that must 

be taken into consideration.  On balance, however, I see no 

reason to alter our target of a $265 million deficit.  The 

mid-year update will detail our projections for you and for 

the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Speaker, this correspondence verifies again and again that 

the Conservative government of the day did everything to hide 

the true state of the finances of the province, not only from the 

Leader of the Liberty Party and the Leader of the NDP (New 

Democratic Party) at the time, but from the people of the 

province of Saskatchewan.  The Provincial Auditor's report 

details that time and time again.  I say to you, sir, that these 

people opposite in opposition perpetrated a massive fraud on 

the people of Saskatchewan by covering up the financial 

picture. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The purpose of this 

session is going to be exactly who perpetrated the fraud on the 

people of Saskatchewan.  We say you knew.  That is what we 

are saying. 



112 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

Mr. Premier, at your first news conference of the election 

campaign, you told the people of Saskatchewan that the deficit 

was hundreds of millions of dollars higher than projected.  At 

the same news conference you promised -- and I'm going to 

quote what you promised: we are not going to be taxing people.  

We are not going to be taxing people. 

 

You said, Mr. Premier, that you knew we had a debt crisis.  

And even with that knowledge, you promised no tax increases.  

How do you now, Mr. Premier, expect the people to believe 

you when you say you have to tax them and destroy their 

medicare system because you didn't know? 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, I'm very pleased that the 

opposition is asking this line of questioning, because their 

chronology needs to be known.  Their chronology is as follows.  

We were told before the election campaign that the stated, 

publicly stated, printed estimate deficit of $265 million that 

your former minister of Finance, Mr. Hepworth, and the former 

premier stood by, was wrong -- was wrong. 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  Would the Premier please be seated.  I 

ask the member from Rosthern -- and no one interrupted him 

when he asked his question -- I would ask him to please let the 

Premier answer the question. 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, based on that 

information, I wrote the letter of September 22 to the premier 

of which I just quoted a moment ago.  I'll table this letter.  I 

asked the premier, was there truth to this or not, and in order 

for us to have this settled in a non-political way, but there 

should be an independently verified financial statement in 

advance of election day.  That's the sequence of events. 

 

I then received a six-page letter from the minister of Finance in 

response to this letter.  That was the next thing that took place, 

whereby the minister of Finance, as it now turns out, totally 

misled the people of the province of Saskatchewan by saying 

$265 million. 

 

I tell you, Mr. Member, that if your statements could have been 

believed on and could have been set out as factually as you 

portrayed them to be, there would not have been the need on 

this government to look at cut-backs or revenue increases 

because we could have found . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  Next question. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, the 

louder the government always applauds of course we know 

we've struck a chord, and I'd like people to remember that. 

 

Mr. Premier, you conveniently forget to tell the people on what 

that $265 million projection was based on.  What was it 

predicated on?  What about the $180 million that you folks lost 

through harmonization?  Well that's part of the package. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask the Premier that when you were 

in opposition, the former minister of Finance pleaded with you 

to understand the terrible fiscal financial position that this 

province was in.  We even said in this House that the 

government was forced to bring forward harmonization 

because if we did not do that, we would not be able to afford 

medicare, education, and the social nets.  The former minister 

of Finance told you these things directly and clearly, and you 

ignored his pleas for support in fighting the deficit.  Instead 

you said the former government was starving health care, 

slashing education, spending too little on social welfare. 

 

Are you now claiming, Mr. Premier, are you now claiming in 

this Assembly, that the former minister of Finance did not ask 

you to support his fight against the deficit, and that if he had 

you would have stopped promising more of everything for 

everyone? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, I am saying, I am 

alleging, that the former premier and the minister of Finance 

and that entire Conservative government perpetrated a massive 

financial fraud on the people of the province of Saskatchewan 

over 10 years.  I say that the minister of Finance, the former 

minister of Finance, introduced a budget which he did not even 

have the courage to pass in the legislature when you prorogued 

in June and you ran away from answering the questions. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- I am saying that in my 

correspondence, and it's reported in the various newspaper 

quotations.  Here's one of September 24: Finance Minister 

Lorne Hepworth said his budget projection is right on target 

despite a series of pre-election spending announcements. 

 

I have another one here of September 27: Elaborating on 

comments he made to the news media on Sunday, Hepworth 

insisted the Finance Department has kept "an extremely tight 

reign on 1991-92 expenditures." 

 

I am saying the letter is predicated on all of those assumptions; 

the letter will talk about this. 

 

And it turns out that that was untrue.  I'm saying to you that if 

you had left this $265 million deficit, we could have managed 

that without the consideration of tax increases and without the 

consideration of tax cuts but for 10 years you have perpetrated 

the massive fiscal fraud in the province of Saskatchewan and 

we're all paying for it now. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  Before the member proceeds, 

extensive applause will only extend question period. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- I thank you for that decision, Mr. Speaker.  

Very well done indeed. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I say to the Premier, there was a massive fraud 

just prior to the 1991 election and you are the folks that 

committed it.  You have a sense of betrayal.  The people of 

Saskatchewan have a sense of betrayal because 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 113 

you said you would do more with less --  no increase in 

taxation.  And all the while you knew, you knew the state.  And 

I'm going to prove that in my further questions here. 

 

Because one of the first things that you said that you did not 

know was that there was a half a billion dollars in CIC (Crown 

Investments Corporation of Saskatchewan) related to the 

Property Management Corporation.  But, Mr. Premier, the 

Provincial Auditor reported this matter in his 1990 annual 

report.  And you supported his position that this money should 

be recorded as an expenditure. 

 

You knew so well that the members of your caucus there 

argued this case right here in the Assembly.  And now you're 

saying you forgot, that you didn't know.  You forgot about 

$500 million during the election campaign when you promised 

no new taxes.  Mr. Premier . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Does the member have a question?  Let's put 

the question. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I have a question.  I 

have a question. 

 

You knew, and you're still promising no tax increases.  Are you 

now saying, Mr. Premier, are you now seriously saying you did 

not know about the $500 million related to the Property 

Management Corporation? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, I must say that I'm 

absolutely amazed at the lack of, I won't say knowledge, but 

the lack of credibility from which this question and series of 

questions is based.  This comes from a member who sat on the 

treasury benches just a short few several months ago.  This 

member pretends that the Ernst & Young complete audit report 

of the Crown Management Board, which shows a loss of $2.9 

billion, he somehow knew nothing about. 

 

This member pretends that the $9 billion cumulative debt and 

the $265 million projected deficit somehow you knew nothing 

about.  All of this was hidden from the people of the province 

of Saskatchewan. 

 

We campaigned on the argument of open the books.  Our first 

and foremost plank was open the books because for 10 years 

you ran huge deficits and for 10 years you weren't even close in 

projecting those deficits.  We said we don't trust you, open the 

books.  And when we opened the books, the level and the scale 

of your mismanagement is massive. 

 

I tell you this budget that is coming down, this position that 

we're put into fiscally, is the legacy of 10 years of waste and 

mismanagement and misplaced priorities for which the people 

of Saskatchewan will never forgive nor forget you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  A new question to 

the Premier.  Mr. Premier, you knew -- you knew.  We have 

had a long litany of items here that show beyond a shadow of a 

doubt that prior to the election in 1991, you 

knew the state of the deficit.  And in spite of that you went on 

the election campaign saying you would do more with less, no 

taxes, $4.5 billion is enough for any government to operate the 

province of Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Member from Riversdale, I ask you if you now claim the 

following statement made by you on March 20, 1991.  At your 

fund-raising dinner here in Regina was the following statement, 

and one that would characterize you expressing knowledge of 

the fiscal situation.  And I quote, I quote you, sir:  We are in 

debt, on the verge of becoming a junk bond client. 

 

Mr. Premier, does this not confirm you knew? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member asks 

me to say that I knew that the financial picture of the province 

of Saskatchewan was bad in March of 1991, I hereby confirm 

what I said in March and I believed it in March of 1991. 

 

The member says why am I saying something different?  I tell 

you why I'm saying something different.  Because as bad as we 

knew it was, nobody could have imagined the horrible mess 

that it really is until you opened up the books.  Nobody could 

have imagined it. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, I have here in front of 

me the NDP election platform card.  This election platform 

card -- when the hon. member and the Leader of the Opposition 

went around during election campaign saying: is that all there 

is, where's the Saskatchewan plan, where's the NDP plan? -- 

this election card on which we campaigned says this:  first 

things first, the top item -- common sense financial 

management; open the books; a public, independent audit of 

the province's financial affairs to cut government waste and 

mismanagement.  I could go on. 

 

We knew in March of 1991 -- we suspected -- but nobody 

knew how massively destructive you were of the treasury until 

we opened the books and now all of Saskatchewan knows what 

you've done to the people, the farmers, and the workers of this 

province. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, this 

simply isn't good enough.  Yesterday in this House when the 

Premier was faced with leaks in his budget which predicate 

changes to medicare and massive tax increases, sir, you stood 

and you said, I didn't know. 

 

Well, Mr. Speaker, the Premier did know because Mr. Donald 

Gass says he did.  And I quote from Mr. Donald Gass from 

February 18, 1992:  The Tories made no attempt to hide the 

province's financial standing.  In fact the books were open all 

along to credit agencies or any one else who was interested.  It 

shouldn't come as news to them -- meaning them the NDP.  

End quote. 

 

Mr. Donald Gass says the Premier knew.  Mr. Premier, 



114 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

today are you going to stand in this legislature then and 

repudiate your hand-picked chairman of the Gass Commission, 

Mr. Gass, because he says you knew, sir. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, I again really welcome 

this line of questioning by the Conservative Party.  I really do 

because these people believe, they believe that somehow the 

people of the province of Saskatchewan made an accident on 

October 21 by electing the NDP.  When the truth of the matter 

is the people of Saskatchewan in their own gut knew that you 

had terribly mismanaged and mishandled the finances.  That's 

in essence. 

 

And here you are, six months later, unrepentant, not knowing 

anything, maintaining the position that somehow everything 

was going along in a well-managed operation, when everybody 

knows you ruined it. 

 

Look, I say, Mr. Speaker, exactly what the attitude of this 

government was.  Here on February 3, 1988, Hon. Mr. 

Berntson, speaking with respect to one of the committees of the 

legislature -- Crown Corporations -- he says this is the policy of 

the government.  I think that can happen here as well.  He says, 

quote: we're going to do what we can though to make it very 

difficult for you people to take it over again when you get back 

into power.  End quote. 

 

This was a scorched earth policy that you embarked upon.  And 

your deals, whether they ranged from Saskferco to any other 

ones that have been identified, to the dividends drawn from the 

Crown management boards, to the Property Management 

Corporation hidden funds, to the Provincial Auditor's reports 

with respect to all of the undetailed expenditures, this is a 

litany, a litany of financial mismanagement which will doom 

the Conservative Party never to return to power again in the 

province of Saskatchewan. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, new 

question to the Premier.  On Wednesday of this week, Mr. 

Premier, organized labour brought to you a report from an 

independent financial analyst of good repute in Canada who 

said, sir, that you have bloated your deficit by half a billion 

dollars.  You add 265 million to 180 million plus 58 million in 

GRIP (gross revenue insurance program), and you end up, sir, 

with over $500 million before you start.  And organized 

labour's own fiscal analysis in this province says that you, sir, 

have bloated those figures by half a billion dollars for purely 

partisan reasons. 

 

Sir, you are saying Don Gass misled this province; you are 

saying that Professor Sentance misled this province.  Would 

you stand in your place today and confirm that, sir. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- You know, Mr. Speaker, these people 

are more confused than I thought they would be.  On the one 

hand they say, look at Mr. Don Gass; he 

supports our contention.  On the other hand they say, don't buy 

Mr. Don Gass because some professor from P.E.I. says, don't 

buy Mr. Don Gass.  We picked this one.  We don't like that 

one.  We choose this one.  Maybe we pick this one, maybe we 

don't.  And that is exactly the position as they try to wiggle off 

the fact, off the hook, that they have created this crisis. 

 

Look, anybody in this province who has been reading 

newspapers and listening to the radio and the television, any 

independent authority in this area knows the situation fiscally 

that exists.  I say to the House Leader, to the deputy leader over 

there from Thunder Creek, the best thing for the Conservative 

Party to do is to make one simple confession.  You'll gain your 

credibility back by telling the people of Saskatchewan that you 

blew it and you blew it badly.  Get rid of the people who are 

party to that; that probably involves you and your desk-mates 

in the front row.  Start afresh and start with some honesty to the 

public finances of this province. 

 

Don't give me the business of citing Barb Byers.  You, of all 

people, attacking Barb Byers in support of your argument 

because you have no credibility whatsoever for creating this 

mess -- no credibility whatsoever. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  New question to 

the Premier.  Mr. Premier, the only confession that should 

come from anyone in this province is from you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Mr. Premier, your own Minister of Finance, 

at the cost of $400,000 to the people of this province, filed a 

prospectus in Washington D.C. just a short time ago that said in 

a sworn statement that the books of this province, at least since 

1985, as confirmed by the auditor, were fair and adjudicated 

properly.  In other words, he stood behind those numbers in the 

courts of the United States of America at great cost to the 

taxpayers in this province. 

 

Sir, are you saying that Don Gass misled this province, that 

Professor Sentance misled this province, and that your Minister 

of Finance has either misled the American courts or he's misled 

the people of this province?  Which is it, sir? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Mr. Speaker, I'm saying to the 

member from Thunder Creek that you're confused.  Part of that 

submission had appended to it the Gass report. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- I read it. 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- The member says, I read it.  But the 

member in his question . . . he admits that he read it, but note 

the political games he's playing.  He doesn't admit to it in his 

question; he doesn't say that you attached the Gass report to 

flesh out the entire picture to the New York people.  No.  He 

only says the Provincial Auditor, the Provincial Auditor who 

complained, by the way.  You remember he complained in 

1991 that he 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 115 

couldn't verify the books. 

 

Remember what Mr. Bob Andrew did when he maligned the 

Provincial Auditor?  He said . . . the Provincial Auditor said 

that 50 cents out of every taxpayers' dollar he couldn't verify.  

That report you referred to, we appended to that New York 

report, Gass; and with that the total picture was set out to the 

financiers.  Why didn't you tell that to the people in this 

legislature when you asked that question? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  New question to 

the Premier.  The Premier knows full well that that appendage 

in there simply stated that the difference in the debt was no 

different between accrual accounting and the cash basis that 

have always been used in this province.  And that's all it said, 

sir.  And now you are trying to mislead this Assembly by 

saying that. 

 

Sir, Donald Gass says you knew.  Organized labour's 

hand-picked accountant -- hand-picked accountant -- says you 

have bloated that deficit by half a billion dollars and that you 

knew.  And your own Minister of Finance can go south of the 

49th and borrow a billion dollars and say that the books were in 

order, sir.  Someone, Mr. Premier, someone is lying to the 

Saskatchewan people.  Someone is . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  Order.  The member from Thunder 

Creek knows full well that he's out of order in using that kind 

of language, and I ask him to withdraw the statement. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Mr. Speaker, I asked the Premier to answer 

the question. 

 

The Speaker: -- I ask the member one more time to withdraw 

the statement.  He knows it's unparliamentary, and I ask him to 

withdraw the statement. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- Mr. Speaker, I simply asked the Premier to 

answer the question. 

 

The Speaker: -- I will give the member this last warning to 

withdraw the unparliamentary remark that he made, and this 

will be your last warning, sir.  I ask you to withdraw that 

statement. 

 

Mr. Swenson: -- I respect your judgement, Mr. Speaker, but I 

simply asked the Premier to answer the question. 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  Order.  I have asked the member three 

times to withdraw that statement, which he has refused to do.  

Therefore I have no choice but under rule 28 to name the 

member, and I name you, Mr. Swenson. 

 

Therefore under rule 28, I ask the member to withdraw from 

the legislature. 

 

Order.  Will the member from Moose Jaw Palliser please come 

to order. 

 

ORDERS OF THE DAY 

QUESTIONS PUT BY MEMBERS 
 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: -- Mr. Speaker, this relates to the

The Speaker: -- Motions for return (debatable), questions 1 to 

9. 

 

MOTIONS FOR RETURNS (Not Debatable) 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: -- Mr. Speaker, as it relates to motion

documents. 

 

The Speaker: -- 2 to 5 tabled by minister. 

 

SPECIAL ORDER 

 

ADJOURNED DEBATES 

 

ADDRESS IN REPLY 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the address in 

reply which was moved by Mr. Sonntag, seconded by Ms. 

Hamilton. 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I count it 

a pleasure, and it's certainly an honour, again to stand in this 

Assembly and speak in reply to the Speech from the Throne. 

 

I however note as well, Mr. Speaker, that it is May 1, 1992.  

And, Mr. Speaker, when I first entered this Assembly, when I 

first entered the political sphere, I had a perception of this 

legislature possibly meeting a lot earlier in the year.  It's just 

too nice outside to be in these stone walls at this present time 

debating so late in the year, entering into a political session, a 

legislative session. 

 

But the reason I say I anticipated we would be here earlier was 

because of many of the indications that were left by the present 

government, the former opposition members, prior to October 

21, '92, that this place would operate in a more orderly fashion 

and that we would have dates more conducive to the operation 

of this House and certainly that would accommodate members 

of this Assembly and allow them to represent their constituents 

to the best of their ability. 

 

As I say that, Mr. Speaker, I've been looking through the 

Speech from the Throne, and I find the Speech from the Throne 

to be, in a few simple words, very empty and hollow -- just as 

empty and hollow as the NDP platform that was run last fall, 

Mr. Speaker, through the month of October when the then 

chairman of the NDP campaign suggested to the people of this 

province that indeed the NDP had no plan.  And they in fact 

they didn't need a plan to go into that election and indeed as we 

saw on October 



116 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

21, form the government of this province. 

 

Mr. Speaker, they were elected without a plan and what do we 

see today?  Almost seven months since the election day, we 

still have no plan being laid out before us.  We don't see a plan.  

And, Mr. Speaker, just recently in talking to constituents and a 

few people and individuals around the province, the same 

impression has been left with them, that there continues to be a 

lack of direction, a lack of a plan for this province.  I guess it 

indicates there hasn't . . . not much has changed with the NDP 

party forming government. 

 

It seems, Mr. Speaker, that not only to the members of this 

opposition, Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, but to many 

people in this province that a lot of people are very 

disappointed. 

 

I think, Mr. Speaker, that it is high time that the government, 

the NDP, accept the fact that they are now government and that 

they start dealing with what that means, rather than what we 

have witnessed over the last number of months and certainly 

this first week of this legislative session. 

 

Mr. Speaker, being elected to form the government of this 

province, the people of this province asked this government for 

some leadership.  And they may have felt they lacked some 

leadership prior to October 1991.  But, Mr. Speaker, as I get on 

in my speech I will indicate that there was indeed leadership, 

the people knew they were going . . . where they were going 

prior to October 21. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we have waited for about six months for new 

direction, or for some direction at all; for some responsibility, 

something of substance to come from this government.  But I'm 

sorry, Mr. Speaker, it appears that we continue to stand beside 

a well that is dry -- a well that doesn't have any substance, in 

fact lacks anything at all. 

 

As I said earlier, this government has tried its best to point its 

fingers towards the previous government as an excuse to not 

deliver any of the election promises they made prior to October 

1991. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, when we talk about election promises, we 

don't talk about just promises or indications given during the 

writ period.  And, Mr. Speaker, having sat in this House prior 

to October 1991 through the last four years, on many occasions 

members on this side of the House when they were in 

opposition promised that they would do things so much better.  

In fact if I'm not mistaken, the saying of the day was: waste and 

mismanagement.  Every time you turned around, members 

were talking about waste and mismanagement. 

 

And they would just eliminate waste and mismanagement and 

they would be able to deliver more into health care, more into 

education, more into social services, indeed the pot-holes on 

the highways in Saskatchewan would be repaired.  And I'm 

sorry to say, Mr. Speaker, but as I talked to many people we 

find that since October our highway system has probably really 

disintegrated and has indeed disintegrated.  In fact is that any 

wonder why ministers are flying around the province 

rather than driving?  It's much easier and much smoother. 

 

Well I'm afraid, Mr. Speaker, the people of this province are 

not going to accept the fact that this government continues to 

put all the onus on the former government, continues to blame 

the former government for everything they can't do or the 

things they'd like to do but can't because this so-called former 

government misled the public.  Well I'm afraid, Mr. Speaker, 

that's not good enough. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Premier and the government knew the state of 

the Saskatchewan economy.  They cannot continue to blame 

the former government for something they knew all along.  

And I believe, Mr. Speaker, that was pointed out in question 

period again today. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, they continue to say waste -- they said prior 

to October 21, waste and mismanagement; we'll do all this for 

you.  And now they're saying we can't do it because we didn't 

know. 

 

Well, Mr. Speaker, we are saying they did know.  They knew 

exactly what they were getting themselves into.  They knew 

exactly where they were going.  It's just, Mr. Speaker, is it 

possible that while they were saying they didn't know -- they 

only did that for one reason, one reason alone -- that the 

member from Saskatoon Riversdale had only one intention in 

his mind: to lead the people of Saskatchewan down a garden 

path with blinders on their eyes so they wouldn't know exactly 

what they were facing and, through the anger that the 

population faced at that time, slide into power and then do 

whatever they pleased. 

 

Mr. Speaker, on one hand the NDP are saying to the people, 

those bad, bad Tories left us nothing but a bare cupboard, so 

we can't increase spending to education or health care, anything 

else either.  So I guess we can't give the promises . . . or keep 

the promises we gave. 
 

Well, Mr. Speaker, they are going to have to answer to the 

people of Saskatchewan.  We in this as an oppositional party 

will continue to remind the people that they knew, that they 

knew exactly what the finances of this province were, that they 

knew exactly what they were facing, and they were not being 

honest . . . 
 

The Speaker: -- Order, order.  There's just too much noise in 

the Chamber.  I can't even hear the member speak from over 

here.  Could we just cut down the chatter a bit, and if you wish 

to have private conversation of a loud nature, go to your 

lounges, all right? 
 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, it would 

appear to me and to many people and to the electorate of the 

province of Saskatchewan that this government cannot 

continue to hide behind the façade of the fact that they didn't 

know. 
 

Mr. Speaker, I think when we look at the Minister of Finance 

and his about-face turn and his painting a completely different 

picture today, after trying to paint a bleak, barren picture of our 

economy to the public so they would all be ready to reach 

deeper into their pockets, the Minister of Finance has his 

signature on this prospectus. 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 117 

What I have, Mr. Speaker, is an application to borrow a billion 

dollars from the United States.  To do so, Mr. Speaker, do you 

think the Minister of Finance could go down with that bleak 

picture he was painting of the provincial economy and expect 

the Americans to all of a sudden hand him some money? 

 

No, Mr. Speaker, when it came to laying out the facts so that 

the lenders in New York would be more than willing to lend 

some more money to the province of Saskatchewan, he indeed 

took a serious look at the books as was indicated by Mr. Gass.  

And as we have seen, this professor Mr. Sentance from New 

Brunswick or Prince Edward Island indicate he took a fair look 

and he's indicated that indeed the books had been open, that 

indeed the numbers were there.  He laid them out for the 

Americans so that they indeed would continue to honour and to 

give the much-needed money, to lend money to the province of 

Saskatchewan so we could operate. 

 

So we see the Department of Finance prepared a prospectus on 

our province's finances for the past few years and those ahead.  

And I would like to just remind the Assembly of a few 

interesting things.  And, Mr. Speaker, while I indicated that the 

. . . shortly after the provincial election the budget figures 

bounced anywhere from 500 million deficit for the '91-92 fiscal 

year to -- and gradually every time you turned around it had a 

different number -- it was 800 million. 

 

And it seemed that the Premier didn't even know . . . the 

Premier and the Finance minister weren't even conferring 

together.  Because where the Finance minister would say 800 

million, the Premier was saying 900 million.  And eventually, 

Mr. Speaker, it ended up at, I believe, in the $1.2 million. 

 

And as I indicated again, Mr. Speaker, why in the world would 

a government inflate figures like that?  Why would they use 

those figures?  What was their purpose? -- when indeed the 

books . . . and the Finance minister himself recognized that the 

books were open, that the facts were there.  Otherwise they 

wouldn't have even gone to New York.  They did it, Mr. 

Speaker, because they wanted the province . . . people of 

Saskatchewan to look the other way as they reached deeper 

into their pockets. 

 

This document signed by the NDP Minister of Finance 

opposite me today says that the budgetary deficit in 1991 was 

indeed $360 million.  And it also states that in 1987, following 

serious drought, our deficit was 1.2 billion.  This document, 

Mr. Speaker, proves since 1987 through 1991 under the 

previous government, Saskatchewan's deficit actually 

decreased by over 60 per cent.  And you just take a look at the 

prospectus, it's all in there -- a decrease of 60 per cent, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

I would also like to add that given the fact harmonization 

would have added an additional 200 million or so to the 

government purse, the deficit in 1991 could have been less than 

200 million. 

 

Sort of makes you wonder why the member from Riversdale, 

the Minister of Finance, and the member from Elphinstone, and 

other NDP MLAs (Member of the 

Legislative Assembly) have been predicting a deficit anywhere 

from 500 million to 1.2 billion. 

 

(1045) 

 

Mr. Speaker, what is it?  It can't be one or the other.  It just 

seems the figures are given depending on the crowd they're 

with and the message they want to get across.  All these 

members have to do is study the documents of their own 

minister and the Department of Finance that they have put 

together, to find out where the true deficit lies. 

 

But, Mr. Speaker, this is not -- I say it again -- this is not what 

the NDP want the public to know.  If the public finds out the 

deficit is not as bad as the NDP say it is, what do you think will 

happen?  Mr. Speaker, I'm afraid that the expectations of many 

of those groups who voted for the NDP, when they find out the 

truth of this deficit, will the groups out there, Mr. Speaker, as 

they look at the books and as the Saskatchewan union of public 

employees have done, Mr. Speaker, in asking for an 

independent audit. It will indicate to them, as they've already 

indicated to the government opposite, that the numbers were 

cooked and that indeed I believe they will find members across 

this province rising up in anger at being misled by the 

government. 

 

And the fact that the government have said at one time, prior to 

October '91, that they would indeed put more money into 

health, they would put more money into education, that they 

would care for those hungry people out there, that they would 

be compassionate and honest as the throne speech indicates.  

Mr. Speaker, it appears to me that many people who had high 

expectations will be very annoyed and angered to find out that 

the government that they indeed elected to govern this 

province, and that has not been very honest with them 

regarding the deficit as they find out the truth, will rise up in 

anger. 

 

The public will expect promises made by the NDP to be 

honoured, increases in health care and educational funding, and 

-- read my lips -- didn't they say no new taxes?  And all of the 

other promises that have been made over the past number of 

years while they were in opposition, and we all know there 

were plenty of them. 

 

And I believe even the new Associate Minister of Finance 

indicated recently that maybe some of the comments they made 

while they were in opposition were maybe a little flippant and 

they shouldn't have been quite as open -- it may have given 

people the wrong impression. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the NDP are finding themselves in exactly the 

position they do not want to be in -- caught red-handed with the 

public finding out the truth.  After all, Mr. Speaker, they've 

been promising open and honest government, and I wonder if 

they have any intention of delivering on it. 

 

The members opposite must be taking their NDP colleague, 

Shelley Martel's advice.  Mr. Speaker, she is the NDP Minister 

of Northern Development in Ontario, 



118 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

who blurted out information about a Sudbury doctor's income 

and then claimed to have made up the charges.  Shelley now 

refuses to resign her portfolio in Ontario because, and I have to 

quote the article in front of me from the Leader-Post dated 

April 21, 1992: 

 

 This is the . . . young lady who has taken a lie-detector test to 

prove she is a liar . . . Her defence, in refusing to resign her 

portfolio, is that she has proof she is a liar. 

 

It's like saying, well I made it up and I meant it, so it's all right. 

 

Mr. Speaker, almost sounds like members across the way may 

have a defence for what they are doing after all.  Did they 

mislead the public intentionally? If they did, then I guess it's all 

right. 

 

Mr. Speaker, to further illustrate my point, in the first 

Economic Review put out by this government, the government 

Minister of Finance writes that economic growth will be 

supported by a second heavy oil upgrader, a fertilizer plant, and 

a pulp mill, and I quote from the Minister's document: 

 

 Saskatchewan's manufacturing sector is small but the 

construction of a second heavy oil upgrader, a fertilizer plant 

and a pulp mill will help support economic growth in 1991 as 

well as offer opportunities for more growth in (the) future 

when these new facilities come on stream or reach full 

capacity production. 

 

Very interesting, Mr. Speaker, very interesting.  All of a 

sudden we find that the members now, while they're on the 

government side of the House, find that maybe Saskferco isn't 

that bad a project after all. 

 

Now for those of us who were around prior when the previous 

government was putting these projects together, the opposition 

of the day was not pleased.  And let me remind you of some of 

their comments.  In fact, the member from Riversdale referred 

to the fertilizer plant at Belle Plaine as a white elephant. 

 

The NDP went on and on about how the fertilizer plant is not 

needed and how it will be a fiasco.  And yet the Minister of 

Finance indicates that it certainly has been a positive indicator 

for employment in the Province of Saskatchewan and will 

continue to be that. 

 

It is interesting that now they are hailing the economic 

spin-offs these projects will bring.  The NDP are admitting 

these projects are what will keep our manufacturing sector 

afloat. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I guess it's a good thing people with vision, 

people with plans, continue to work hard at achieving their 

goals, even though many are met with opposition from many 

short-sighted individuals.  I believe the comment by the 

minister is also quite a compliment to the former government.  

The statement made by the Minister of Finance in the 

Economic Review proves something, Mr. Speaker -- it proves 

that the former government was on the right track, that our plan 

was working, and Saskatchewan was growing.  Even the NDP 

Minister of Finance says so. 

But, Mr. Speaker, the NDP did not say the heavy oil upgrader 

or Weyerhaeuser or Saskferco were good ideas while they were 

in opposition.  At least I don't remember at any time having had 

a positive comment on them.  Instead it seemed, Mr. Speaker, 

every time we turned around, the NDP opposed each and every 

economic opportunity the government of the day brought 

forward. 

 

It would be interesting to see today where they stand on 

Saskferco, on Weyerhaeuser, on WESTBRIDGE.  And keeping 

true to form, they continue to walk blindly by other open doors 

by completely ignoring opportunities that lay on their doorstep, 

like AECL (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.) energy agreement 

and harmonization. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we're all familiar with what happened with 

respect to harmonizing the GST (goods and services tax) with 

the expanded E&H (education and health) tax in this Assembly 

last year.  How the NDP swore to never let harmonization pass.  

They would fight to the end because 4.5 billion was enough to 

run this province.  At least I believe that's what the Premier 

promised. 

 

Yes, in the Leader-Post, September 6 '91: 

 

 Romanow is promising a government that will "live within its 

means" and spend no more than the current budget Estimates 

of 4.5 billion annually. 

 

In fact, Mr. Speaker, they continue to say: it was those bad, bad 

Tories again, as they said that we're not increasing health care 

and education and funding enough.  Remember that, Mr. 

Speaker? 

 

While we were arguing about the fact that harmonization 

would simplify the tax, simplifies the taxation system as well 

as drawing new revenue and be fair to everyone, we're also 

increasing spending on health care and education. 

 

And they continue to hide behind those bad, bad Tories or the 

former government.  It was those bad Tories who are forcing 

people to pay a huge 7 cents on a hamburger at McDonald's 

when the then opposition said the province did not need the 

money.  Now what do we see them doing? 

 

As the former government tried to get the message out that 

revenue was needed and the fairest, most efficient way to raise 

that revenue was through tax harmonization, every special 

interest group in the province jumped on the NDP bandwagon 

to frighten the people and destroy rational debate. 

 

The member from Riversdale promised, and I quote the 

Leader-Post from September 6 again: that they would not need 

more than $4.5 billion annually to run the province, to 

administer the needs of this province. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, what do we have instead?  No new taxes.  

But what about SaskTel rates?  What about SGI (Saskatchewan 

Government Insurance) increases?  What about SaskPower 

bills, the rate increases?  Mr. Speaker, if those aren't taxes . . . 

tax increases, tax increases that were brought into effect 

without approval of this legislature, 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 119 

then I ask, what are taxes?  What do you call tax increases?  

That along with the NDP promises we have all heard over and 

over again for increased health spending, education funding, 

and the rest, and the list is long. 

 

Well it certainly is interesting isn't it, Mr. Speaker, that the 

member from Regina Elphinstone was quoted just a couple 

weeks ago as saying the NDP would look at harmonization.  

That is interesting that they would indeed look at 

harmonization.  The NDP would look to harmonize because it 

was the right thing to do a year ago, and it was needed, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

As the former minister of Finance indicated, it was needed, and 

it was the right thing and was the simplest form of revenue 

increase as well as simplifying the taxation system. 

 

The problem is, Mr. Speaker, the people had no idea that the 

NDP was talking about taking off harmonization only to 

replace it with a new provincial family tax on health care. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I remember hearing all the arguments after 

October 21, and maybe we all did.  How indignant people were 

when they went to buy products at the grocery store or at a 

number of businesses in this province only to find that there 

was still an education and health tax, that the PST (provincial 

sales tax) just eliminated a very small amount of taxation in 

this province. 

 

And now we find, Mr. Speaker, that not only were the NDP not 

totally honest at that time, but, Mr. Speaker, they have already 

indicated that they are going to put another tax on the people of 

this province -- a provincial family tax on health care.  The 

people had no idea that the member of Riversdale would rather 

tax the poor and the sick in our province than admit he was 

wrong.  People had no idea that the NDP would be increasing 

taxes because the Leader of the NDP solemnly gave his word 

this would not happen. 

 

In fact, Mr. Speaker, I believe the people of this province 

deserve an apology from the member of Riversdale.  He should 

stand up and admit that he was wrong and that he deliberately 

led the public of Saskatchewan down the garden path because 

of . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Order, order.  The member may not say that 

someone deliberately misled.  That's unparliamentary language, 

and I ask him to withdraw that statement. 

 

Mr. Toth: -- I'm sorry, Mr. Speaker.  I guess I should phrase it 

that he led the public of Saskatchewan down the garden path 

because it was more important to sit in that chair than it was to 

be forthright and open with the public. 

 

One of my colleagues hit the nail on the head when he referred 

to the October election as the election of deception.  It says it 

all. 

 

All of a sudden the member from Elphinstone thinks it is a 

good idea to harmonize.  He knew it all along, Mr. Speaker.  

The rest of the NDP knew it too.  They just didn't think it made 

good TV or good election promise.  Of 

course the member from Elphinstone couldn't quite muster up 

the courage to admit the former government was right with 

respect to harmonization, but it is obvious to everyone now.  

Chalk up one more for the previous government. 

 

But, Mr. Speaker, there is a huge difference here.  We must 

remember that when harmonization was proposed by the 

former administration it was proposed at the same time health 

care was receiving increases in funding, at the same time as 

education was receiving increases in funding, and there were 

no health care premium proposals, Mr. Speaker.  I guess a few 

cents on a restaurant meal pales in comparison to what the 

NDP are doing today. 

 

The NDP, Mr. Speaker, are stretching the old blame-the-Tories 

idea far too long.  And I believe, as I indicated earlier, people 

all across this province are catching on and are becoming 

annoyed.  They want this government . . . they're asking for 

leadership and they don't see it. 

 

For example, how about the "open the books" tour made by the 

NDP?  Members opposite held meetings talking about how the 

books have been closed by the Tories and I believe the slogan 

they liked to use was: open the books, jail the crooks. 

 

(1100) 

 

Well after being elected the NDP decided to have a review 

commission set up to examine the provincial financial 

situation.  And, Mr. Speaker, what was the outcome?  I'm sure 

the outcome came not only as a surprise to the government, but 

to the people of this province.  What do we find, Mr. Speaker?  

The Gass Commission said the books were open already. 

 

In fact the NDP cannot continue to blame the former 

administration for everything, Mr. Speaker, because the public 

knows better.  They heard Donald Gass, the chairman 

appointed by the NDP to open the books, talk on CKCK TV 

news and what did he say?  He said that the books were open, 

that the former government made no attempts to hide it.  He 

said the commission says the Tories made no attempt to hide 

the province's financial standing.  In fact the books were open 

all along, not only to credit agencies or to anyone else that was 

interested. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I believe we've heard enough over the last few 

months to indicate that indeed the books and the accounting of 

the former government was as wide open as you could find it.  

The books were open all along.  In essence, the NDP spent 

$300,000 on a commission that told the public what it was 

already aware of. 

 

Now that in itself is a good example, Mr. Speaker, I would 

think, of waste and mismanagement -- spending $300,000 to 

indeed indicate to the people of this province that the books 

that the former government talked about were open.  And, Mr. 

Speaker, I'm sure that was a hard pill to swallow for the NDP 

and for the government. 

 

Waste and mismanagement, Mr. Speaker?  Something the 



120 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

NDP said they would never partake in along with patronage, 

firings, dishonesty, and the like. 

 

And we look at the throne speech, Mr. Speaker.  When you talk 

about patronage, there wouldn't be patronage.  What do we 

find?  Five hundred and eighty or so people have already been 

hired to government agencies. 

 

I believe in the throne speech the government also indicated 

that it will be appointing a Provincial Health Council, that it 

will be appointing a Saskatchewan Education Council.  It 

seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that this government, now that they 

are government, while in opposition said that they wouldn't . . . 

there were too many boards and commissions, too many 

councils, too many patronage job appointments, have now all 

of a sudden flippantly looked the other way and are indeed 

adding more councils, appointing more people to positions.  

And I wonder why they are adding more councils or appointing 

more committees.  Is it, Mr. Speaker, to find jobs for more of 

the people who supported them? 

 

I would like to remind the members opposite of something, Mr. 

Speaker.  They were elected by the people and they raised 

some very high expectations.  And the NDP should also be 

reminded that the people will not forget.  The NDP can look at 

1991 and suggest it's the demise of the Tories.  Well, Mr. 

Speaker, we can look back at 1982.  And the people spoke in 

1982.  And I believe when this government gets the courage to 

call another election, the people again will speak.  And this 

government may be surprised to find out how the people of this 

province can remember. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I for one will be right alongside some of the 

people of this province rallying and decrying at what the NDP 

have done with their promises.  The public of Saskatchewan 

will not allow this government to continue to lead them in the 

opposite direction of what they promise.  They will not allow 

them to continue to betray them. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would also like to give the government a piece 

of advice.  In their Speech from the Throne they talked about 

being open and honest and helping the public through hearings.  

Let the people have a voice.  Mr. Speaker, if this government 

really believes in giving the people an opportunity to speak and 

if this government really believes that they are going to listen, 

then have the courage to listen.  Not just to people that you 

invite.  Not just to a few individuals that you want to invite to a 

meeting, but go out and let the average person on the street 

speak.  Listen to them.  Hear what they are saying. 

 

After promising open government, the NDP must hold public 

hearings on such important things as a flat tax on health care.  

You all promised that.  You said you would listen to the 

people.  You said you cared.  Now it's time to prove you were 

not telling tall tales to get elected. 

 

Mr. Speaker, as a member of this opposition, I cannot support 

this throne speech.  But I will indicate to you and all members 

and to the people of this province that I will continue to speak 

on their behalf.  I will continue to represent, not only my 

constituency, but people right 

across this province.  I will continue to speak out and hold this 

government accountable for all the promises they made and all 

the innuendoes.  And I will continue to speak out and ask this 

government to be open, to be honest, and to indeed admit that 

they knew where the finances were and indeed lead this 

province down the road. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I'm honoured to 

join into the debate on the Speech from the Throne today in the 

second session of the twenty-second legislature. 

 

This throne speech, Mr. Speaker, sets out a clear direction and 

goals that a New Democratic government value -- goals and 

values the people want from a government. 

 

While I read through the throne speech, I notice the first 

subheading, Mr. Speaker: "A Mandate for Change".  And I 

have to ask why, why did this government receive such a 

strong mandate for change? -- 55 seat majority. 

 

I guess the display from the member from Thunder Creek 

really says it all when he was rejected from the legislature this 

morning.  People are tired of those displays.  And they gave 

this government the mandate because of 10 years of 

mismanagement, because they've been ruling by division -- 

urban against rural, workers against farmers. 

 

Mr. Speaker, last January the Public Accounts Committee 

asked the Provincial Auditor to review all government 

organizations and report on instances where they first made 

payments to employees not working for them, made payments 

to advertising agencies for goods and services not received, 

where they provided goods and services to ministers of the 

Crown without charge, and provided goods and services to 

other government organizations without charge. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Whisky for Graham Taylor. 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- That's right. 

 

The review did not take the form of an actual investigation, 

leading the Provincial Auditor to admit that its results may not 

be complete.  Even with these restrictions, however, the 

Provincial Auditor's special report outlines dozens of cases 

involving millions of dollars worth of waste and 

mismanagement, if not possible corruption as well.  And that's 

shameful. 

 

Organizations reported there were 130 employees who for 

extended periods of time did not work for the organizations 

paying their salaries.  That's shameful.  Payments to these 

employees totalled approximately $5.166 million over the two 

years under review.  They included 32 people hired by 

government corporations and paid a total of 1.2 million when 

they actually worked as ministerial assistants and not for these 

corporations. 

 

If that's not enough, we had organizations reported that they 

paid $603,416 to 19 employees and didn't know 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 121 

where they worked. 

 

In addition, the following organizations . . . or we had 

organizations reported that they paid 3.364 million to 79 

employees who didn't work for them.  Didn't know who they 

were. 

 

They had five organizations who reported that they provided 

$42,000 worth of goods and services to cabinet ministers and 

others without charge.  The Department of Highways and 

Transportation did not ensure that all its equipment was 

accounted for when the ministers were changed.  Consequently 

the Provincial Auditor couldn't determine if there was a loss to 

the Crown here, or how much. 

 

The Saskatchewan Centre of the Arts reported that three 

ministers used private viewing suites containing four seats a 

total of 17 times for free.  That's abuse. 

 

SGI reported that it paid taxi fares of $682 for various ministers 

and their staff even though a charge account for this is 

available at the legislature.  Unacceptable to the people. 

 

The Saskatchewan Liquor Board paid expenses totalling 

16,162 for ministers to attend the Big Valley Jamboree. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Oh, that's the one where they had their 

own trailer and their own free whisky. 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- That's right.  They had their own trailer, 

free whisky.  Expenses which included passes to the grounds, 

food, trailer rental, alcohol, and miscellaneous expenses -- 

there was booze involved.  The Liquor Board also provided 

approximately $19,285 of liquor to ministers' offices without 

written requests to do so. 

 

SaskTel paid 6,172 for season tickets to Saskatchewan 

Roughriders and for memberships and expenses to the green 

and white lounge for its minister without any documentation 

for this purpose.  That is shameful. 

 

Nine organizations reported that they paid a total of 439,000 to 

advertising agencies for goods and services not received.  I'll 

read just a few of those. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Who was that?  Would that be Dome 

Media? 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- I notice Dome Media is on here.  

Department of Community Services payments total 9,314 of 

which Dome Advertising got $4,011 and Dome Media Buying 

Services $5,303.  Provincial Secretary is another one I see 

down on the list.  Payments totalled $206,600.  Roberts & 

Poole Communications Ltd., they got 51,000 of that; Dome 

Advertising, 19,000; Smail Communications, 26,000; 

Communigrafx, 36,000; Capital Communications, 48,000; 

Strategy West Public Relations, 25,000. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- And no remorse these people have, none. 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- None whatsoever. 

I see I have another news clipping here, Mr. Speaker:  "Auditor 

blasts STC expenses".  And it's clippings like this that are 

coming out in the news day after day after day.  In this one it 

says: 

 

 $17,500 for Regina restaurant meals were claimed by STC 

executives, even though there was little evidence these were 

for business purposes; 

 

An Hon. Member: -- And all this when there's hungry kids. 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- That's right, they're doing this when there's 

hungry kids. 

 

 $95,000 in travel -- including $2,913 (2,900) from a resort 

hotel in Clear Lake, Man. -- was charged to the company 

even though there was little evidence these were business 

trips; 

 

 Executive benefits included automobiles, RRSP payments, 

deferred profit sharing, football tickets and club memberships 

. . . 

 

And the list is on and on and on.  They said they didn't know 

who was getting it, they said they didn't. 

 

Well, Mr. Speaker, the people had had enough, and that's why 

we received such a large majority of mandate for change. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- They said they couldn't take any more 

abuse from the members opposite.  And that's why when I look 

through this throne speech and look at the subheadings, it tells 

us what people want, what they truly want of a government.  

They don't want us using theatre passes and football tickets and 

free booze in offices.  They want to have a government, Mr. 

Speaker, that's putting their financial house in order.  A new 

government and a new direction. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Working for the people, not themselves. 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- That's right -- working for people.  One 

determined to restore common sense and competence to the 

management of the public treasury.  Government must learn 

once again to live within its means. 

 

Also quoting from the throne speech: 

 

 A family which lives on borrowed money too long, loses its 

freedom to make spending choices and limits its ability to 

plan for the future.  So too with a society.  If we fail to get the 

provincial deficit under control, we will soon lose the 

financial freedom to spend what we choose on vital services, 

and we'll cripple our ability to plan and invest for the future. 

 

 Our children did not create this debt.  We have no right to 

burden them with it. 



122 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

And what the people want, Mr. Speaker, is just what's in this 

throne speech: open, honest and accountable government. 

 

Next subheading: "Jobs and Economic Opportunities." 

 

I see here in the throne speech it says: 

 

 In total, there are currently more that 700 companies which 

have expressed an interest in either relocating to 

Saskatchewan or expanding their operations here.  If these 

businesses proceed with their plans, they have the potential to 

create or maintain more than 16,000 jobs. 

 

And I wonder, Mr. Speaker, if perhaps some of these 

businesses are moving to Saskatchewan at this time or looking 

at moving to Saskatchewan at this time because there is a new 

government with a new set of priorities, a new set of directions. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- Well the people of the province give us a 

challenge, Mr. Speaker, and we took up that challenge.  We've 

taken up that challenge before.  This is the third time that a 

New Democrat-CCF (Co-operative Commonwealth 

Federation) government has been asked to clean up the mess of 

governments like those from the opposite side of the House. 

 

In 1944 Tommy Douglas had to clean up a mess.  In 1971 Al 

Blakeney took over from a Liberal government, and he had to 

clean up a mess and turn things around.  And now in 1991, Roy 

Romanow is given a mandate for change. 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  Order.  The member I think is aware 

that you do not use the names of individuals in this legislature.  

Therefore it's . . . okay? 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- I apologize, Mr. Speaker.  In 1991 the 

Premier of the province, the member from Riversdale, was 

given the mandate to clean up a mess that some of the members 

on the opposite side of the House were part of creating.  And 

we know we need to get this debt under control.  We have to 

get our financial house in order so that we can have our 

financial freedoms in the future and pass that financial freedom 

on to our children so that they can control their future. 

 

We have to become the administrators and administrate our 

own schools and hospitals, local governments.  We have to get 

this under control or Wall Street will control those for us. 

 

Mr. Speaker, agriculture is in a desperate situation.  And the 

situation in the south-west is in a critical state.  We've got 

possible drought, not much moisture in the south-west.  There's 

a loss of farmers through the '80s due to the trade wars, low 

price of grain, the terrible amount of federal off-loading.  I take 

this situation, this agriculture situation in the south-west very 

serious, as does the Premier and the Minister of Agriculture. 

 

But what disappoints me, Mr. Speaker, what really disappoints 

me, are some of the members opposite.  The 

member from Morse, member from Maple Creek, and member 

of Thunder Creek. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- If I really disappointed you, that would 

be in Shaunavon. 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- The member of Thunder Creek, yes you 

did.  You did disappoint me badly in Shaunavon, and I'll get to 

that. 

 

The members opposite have been playing cruel and silly 

politics at a time when rural communities and farmers have a 

great deal of stress, both mentally and financially.  And you're 

playing politics with them. 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  If the member from Prince Albert 

Northcote wants to speak again, he'll have to wait for another 

debate.  I think he spoke in this one last night. 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- And as the member from Morse stated a 

few minutes ago, that he was at the Shaunavon rally.  I was 

there.  I listened to him.  And I was disappointed to hear the 

member from Morse try and incite the farmers into hiring 

lawyers.  Go out and sue the government of which he's a part 

of. 

 

At a time when farmers are concerned about seeding, they're 

concerned about whether they have the financial wherewithal 

to be purchasing their fuel and their fertilizers, repairs for their 

equipment, he wants them to go and hire lawyers.  I don't know 

if that's going to get the crop in.  I don't think it will. 

 

In fact if the member from Morse hadn't been part of a 

government which put us so far in debt, a debt that we're 

paying some $700 million a year in interest payments alone, 

that would go a long ways to helping out those farmers in the 

south-west.  In fact that amount of money would pay the total 

premiums in the agriculture programs from the federal 

government, the provincial government, and producers -- all 

their share.  That's how much money we're talking about.  And 

he was part of that. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the other day members opposite called for an 

emergency debate and motions on agriculture.  I think that was 

a good debate, necessary because of the state of agriculture.  

The 1990 GRIP . . . the 1991 GRIP is seriously flawed.  We 

knew that by the recent news clippings from Alberta and 

Manitoba and the situation they have with the lentils there. 

 

And when they had to join up on the 1991 GRIP, the members 

opposite and the federal Tories were all part of it.  They forced 

farmers into joining the program.  They told them that if they 

don't join, there's no third line of defence coming.  There would 

be no help unless you joined these Conservative programs. 

 

That wasn't enough.  Farmers were still afraid to join the 

program.  So the federal government said, well we'll reduce 

your premiums; we'll give you cheap premiums for the year.  

Those reduced premiums aren't there now, and I don't see the 

member from Maple Creek or Morse fighting for them. 

 

And on this motion and in this debate . . . and on this 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 123 

motion the other day that was put forward by the members 

opposite our Minister of Agriculture made an amendment, and 

a very good amendment.  This amendment -- and I'm going to 

read this amendment to you, Mr. Speaker, first: 

 

 (1) to call on the federal government to meet its outstanding 

commitment to provide farmers with the $500 million 

deficiency payment for the 1990-91 crop year as soon as 

possible and to deliver on its commitment for the third line of 

defence program this year as agreed to at the recent first 

ministers' conference; 

 

That was the first amendment that the Minister of Agriculture 

put forward, and I think that's a good amendment.  It's 

necessary.  And the members on this side of the House 

supported it. 

 

But these south-west members from the opposite side of the 

House, they didn't support it.  The member from Maple Creek, 

the member from Morse, the member from Thunder Creek, in 

fact all the members over there, they voted against that 

amendment. 

 

And I wonder, don't they understand how serious it is in the 

south-west?  The member from Maple Creek spoke yesterday 

about how much dirt was in the air down there -- the wind and 

the dust clouds. 

 

And I asked him, don't you feel we should be receiving this 

$500 million deficiency payment?  Do you want the farmers to 

do it on their own again now that you can't play politics with it?  

Don't you feel the farmers are in need of that money?  I do.  I 

think they need that money. 

 

Why do you put the interests of the federal Mulroney 

government ahead of the interests of the farmers in south-west 

Saskatchewan who you claim to represent? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- You claim to represent those people.  You 

challenged me a few moments ago to run against you in the 

south-west.  Nothing would please me more. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. McPherson: -- The second amendment I'm going to talk 

of in a minute. 

 

We know that the 1992 version of GRIP has its problems.  I've 

raised these concerns with the Premier and the Minister of 

Agriculture and they're very concerned and they're listening. 

 

And the minister recognized the need to extend the deadline, 

and he did so.  And it was brought out in an amendment, the 

second amendment.  And I'll read it now: 

 

 (2) to extend, with the federal government's consent, the 

deadline to a date which is mutually agreeable for farmers, 

the provincial government, and the federal government; 

And once again I'd have to ask the members opposite, 

especially those from the constituencies of Morse, Maple 

Creek, and Thunder Creek, because they understand the 

seriousness of the south-west they say, why didn't they support 

that amendment?  They voted against it.  The members on this 

side of the House voted for that amendment. 

 

The good people of the south-west, they don't want that style of 

politics.  They want to be able to keep their farms.  They've 

asked you for your support and you're not giving it to them.  

Do you not understand the need for extending the deadline?  

Do you not understand the programs . . . (inaudible 

interjection) . . . That's right, voted against the third line of 

defence. 

 

The third amendment put forward by the Minister of 

Agriculture, Mr. Speaker, I'll get to that in a moment.  As I 

stated before, the '91 and the '92 version of GRIP both are not 

perfect.  There's flaws.  But we know we have to go back and 

work on it and be prepared to have a program which is 

acceptable to everyone and covers the needs.  We know that 

there's a need to have a farmer-influenced and represented 

committee.  And that's what this third amendment addresses, 

and I will read that now: 

 

 to accept the request of farmers to establish a review 

commission to design a long-term farm income stability 

program based on the needs of farm families and the actual 

cost of production. 

 

(1130) 

 

Well I think that's a good amendment.  It addresses what we 

have to have addressed.  And the members on this side of the 

House voted for that amendment.  But the members opposite, 

they voted against it.  And I find that disappointing, especially 

from the members from again Morse and Maple Creek and 

Thunder Creek. 

 

Once again I have to ask if these members don't understand the 

critical situation we're facing in the south-west, why they 

would vote against these amendments.  The people of the 

south-west need their support at this time.  They don't need 

their politics.  They need the $500 million deficiency payment 

and they need to have the federal government stop off-loading 

on the farmers.  What they don't need is the members opposite 

voting against us, voting against amendments which ask for 

help for the farmers.  Why are you against the farmers?  You're 

going to have to answer that one. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the throne speech sets out a clear and defined set 

of goals.  It's putting people first, not the corporate friends of 

the members opposite.  It's providing a quality of life so that 

people can raise their families and have the ability to give them 

quality life, education, and health care, and social service 

protection, and to pass that protection on to their children so 

that they can provide their children with the quality of life. 

 

And in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I spoke of the challenge 

before us earlier, and I think the throne speech addresses that 

rather well with what it sets out to do.  It begins the task of 

deficit reduction, sets a new standard of open, honest, and 

accountable government, provides hope for 



124 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

the disadvantaged, and renews the Saskatchewan spirit of 

co-operation and community. 

 

I thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  I rise today 

to enter into the debate of the second session of the 

twenty-second legislature on the Speech from the Throne.  I 

want to congratulate and commend the mover and the seconder 

in their excellent delivery and presentation on the speech. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I am particularly excited and encouraged by the 

speech delivered Monday last by the Lieutenant Governor of 

the province of Saskatchewan, because this throne speech 

exemplifies the four-year plan -- the vision for the future of this 

great province, the plan that sets the stage and provides all of 

us the blueprint to tackle the huge Tory debt of this province, 

and to rebuild Saskatchewan in the way we once knew it -- as a 

New Democratic government where we have responsibility, 

accountability, and a conciliatory process in government.  A 

plan, Mr. Speaker, that focuses our government on a mandate 

for change. 

 

In October of 1991 the people of Saskatchewan, as is the case 

today in spite of the Tory rhetoric, emphatically reiterated that 

never again in the history of this province will we tolerate a 

government whose principles and agenda are so totally out of 

touch with the needs and wishes of the people of Saskatchewan 

as was the previous Tory administration. 

 

For 10 years, Mr. Speaker, the previous Tory administration -- 

as history has already recorded and will reflect in the future -- 

has there ever been such a blatant waste, mismanagement, and 

obvious administrative incompetence as been identified in the 

recent reviewed and tabled auditor's reports and in the recent 

special report by the Provincial Auditor. 

 

Reckless spending, I might suggest, would be considered 

criminal had this practice occurred outside the walls of this 

building by a private citizen or by business. 

 

Never in the history of this province has there been an 

administration that has been so arrogant, and which has shown 

such an absolute disregard for the public accountability and 

physical management.  What disturbs me more is that today we 

have the members opposite, who were a part of that regime, 

defending their actions in the face of the facts of the auditor's 

report. 

 

Mr. Speaker, it is because of this exact behaviour and the 

arrogance that has them sitting over there in the numbers of 10.  

And if they don't start to come clean, Mr. Speaker, when we're 

in here in the next four years, they're going to be out of there. 

 

Today, Mr. Speaker, and in this province, because of the 

practice of the 10 years of a Tory administration, there is a 

reality in the financial . . . that the financial stability and the 

well-being of this province is in grave jeopardy.  And on 

several fronts I have witnessed, as we all have, broken 

spirits, hardship, and deflated will in the lives of many of the 

Saskatchewan folks.  This, Mr. Speaker, is the Tory legacy of 

10 years. 

 

New directions, Mr. Speaker, is our government's theme -- a 

government that is open, honest, accountable and fair and 

compassionate.  This is a New Democratic government.  These 

are New Democratic principles.  And that's what it will take to 

restore confidence and trust in government again. 

 

Our throne speech, Mr. Speaker, I believe has set the stage for 

us to restore those virtues and the belief in government which 

were so clearly destroyed by the Tory administration the past 

10 years. 

 

It is real that we have an overwhelming debt in this province -- 

14 billion -- that looms over us and it prohibits our freedoms to 

bring about change in an expedient and painless fashion.  But 

the women and men in this government and the people of 

Saskatchewan, we know that we didn't create this debt.  You 

people over there did.  The Tories created this debt, along with 

the two other previous debts in this province, which were 

created by the Liberals.  Never a debt under the New 

Democratic administration. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we rebuilt Saskatchewan then, and, my friends, 

we're going to rebuild Saskatchewan again. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- We're going to utilize the principles that we live 

by and that we practise -- compassion, trust, and co-operation 

-- because that's what community is about.  That's what this 

throne speech is about.  And that's what this plan is about and 

that's what this government is about and that's what the people 

of Saskatchewan asked for. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we have identified several priorities in our plan.  

Today our provincial debt is destroying opportunities to 

enhance services, expand programs, and create new economic 

initiatives.  Mr. Speaker, our first priority will be to get the 

deficit under control so we can use those interest dollars which 

are presently used to service the debt back working for the 

people of Saskatchewan in job creation, health, education and 

agriculture. 

 

Could you imagine what we could do with this province if we 

had that $700 million working for us?  Living within our means 

which will come about by making some tough choices, some 

tough choices, has been the message and the reality of the 

Finance minister as he's toured the province in his pre-budget 

consultations and as he prepares to bring down the budget in 

the next few days.  The future of this province and our children 

hinges on our will and commitment to mop up the previous 

uncontrolled government spending and reduce the deficit. 

 

This government is left with few choices, Mr. Speaker.  To 

date, in just five and a half months, our government has set the 

tone and begun the process for open, honest and accountable 

government.  This is exemplified in the Financial Management 

Review whose findings and 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 125 

report have been endorsed in virtually all sectors of this 

province as being a non-partisan, comprehensive, factual and 

futuristic report which even the member opposite from 

Thunder Creek had to commend on local television after its 

release. 

 

Albeit that just three months ago in this very same House they 

reiterated across the floor and opposed the report out of fear, I 

would suppose, of another document being exposed of yet 

another government . . . present government inaccountability of 

their actions. 

 

Not only is our government, Mr. Speaker, committed to 

implementing all the recommendations of this report in the 

future, but our financial minister and associate Finance minister 

have already incorporated recommendations into the 

accountability modem of our government's current operations.  

Truly, Mr. Speaker, a signal that our administration is 

committed to our principles of open and accountable 

government. 

 

In the weeks and months ahead our government will enhance 

this position through amendments to The Provincial Auditor 

Act to implement the Provincial Auditor's access to the books 

of all Crown agencies and to an early release of the Public 

Accounts, as well as introducing a new Members of the 

Legislative Assembly Conflict of Interests Act -- our 

government in action, Mr. Speaker, not just talk and rhetoric, 

which has been the case for the past 10 years of Tory 

government. 

 

As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, membership 

which also includes the member from Arm River, and Thunder 

Creek, and the member from Saskatoon Greystone, they so 

eloquently expressed on so many occasions at our meetings, 

their desire to see open accountable process which our new 

amendments will now provide.  I look forward, Mr. Speaker, 

when this Bill comes forward, that we will see the solid support 

of this entire House and this Assembly, if truly they too believe 

in those principles.  I guess we'll see. 

 

Throughout our campaign and during the past six months our 

members talked about jobs and economic opportunities.  Mr. 

Speaker, in order for our communities to remain viable and 

prosper, we will encourage and participate in creating new and 

expanded job opportunities. 

 

I am most pleased to hear and read in the throne speech the 

example of Harvest Meats in Yorkton and the expansion and 

growth of that operation.  I am also pleased to state that I was 

personally involved in that process as a member of the city 

council of Yorkton. 

 

This is an example of an aggressive entrepreneurship, working 

together with local government, communities, and province 

together, which today they enjoy record sales in Canada and 

across the United States and provide jobs and economic 

spin-offs, not only in our community but in our district. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our province is filled with incubating ideas, 

potential relocatable interests, and local viable enterprises.  

And we know that our government has today, and will continue 

in the future, to work in partnership to 

promote the type of growth and opportunity in this province. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that our government is 

committed to the concept of small is priority over big is better, 

because in 10 Tory years we know that there have been many 

big are better, and now they're all gone, leaving only the legacy 

of bankruptcy and huge provincial financial commitments left 

from the Tory buddy deals, and we know all of them. 

 

Communities coming together in support of local and regional 

projects, goes back to the philosophy of helping each other, 

developing ideas, and creating opportunities.  I know that there 

is enthusiastic interests out there in co-operation, because it is 

happening in my region and I know that it is happening in other 

regions across the province.  Through our Community Bonds 

Act amendments and other amendments to strengthen the 

review and appraisal process on community bond projects, 

Saskatchewan will again be a builder. 

 

(1145) 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- Being a builder, keeping people in Saskatchewan 

as opposed to doing nothing and watching some 80,000 people 

leave this province over the 10 years of your administration. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our government's commitment to restructure our 

department and agencies to better address programs and 

services to business will enhance productivity and will 

eliminate much of the duplication.  This will ensure the 

potential of economic opportunities to not fall through the 

cracks. 

 

Our government focus is to revisit and stimulate a Crown 

corporation development which will be exciting times in 

Saskatchewan, particularly with the focus on rural 

Saskatchewan.  Because not only are we addressing the 

prospects of creating jobs, using the example of co-generation 

power, we are also assisting the stimulation and the sustaining 

of futures of rural communities. 

 

Just another example, Mr. Speaker, of this government's 

commitment to maintaining and supporting a vibrant rural 

economic basis. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- Mr. Speaker, our government's creation of a 

Premier's Economic Action Committee, which will see 

broad-based representation from business, labour, agriculture, 

and local government and others, is the bright signal that 

employment creation and opportunities are an essential element 

for economic recovery in Saskatchewan, and that this process 

will involve Saskatchewan people in an eclectic effort as a 

community in rebuilding this province. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the matter of agriculture and the rural way of life 

remains a high priority for this government.  As a farmer I, too, 

understand firsthand and the crisis that farm 



126 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

families are experiencing today.  Within the past five and a half 

months and prior to this election, I know that our Minister of 

Agriculture and the agriculture caucus and our caucus have 

worked hard and long to make major strides in protecting farm 

families and farm communities -- our trek to Ottawa, the 

moratorium agreement with financial institutions, and the 

design and the implementation of GRIP '92. 

 

It's no secret, Mr. Speaker, that GRIP '92 package is far from 

perfect and we admit that it's not perfect.  But in our part of the 

world where we farm, the majority of farmers will tell you that 

it's as good or better as what you had last year under the GRIP 

Tory.  In fact I have farmers who wish that they were in GRIP 

'92 in 1991. 

 

We know that GRIP must be associated to a more realistic 

cost-of-production formula.  Ottawa's share must be greater, 

the producer premiums need to be reduced and negotiations are 

currently under way to put GRIP back into a workable 

perspective. 

 

We know, Mr. Speaker, that we have to make GRIP better, but 

it can't be a butterfly overnight when today it's a caterpillar.  

But rest assured, Mr. Speaker, that through our minister and 

through this government, we will make GRIP fly. 

 

The introduction of legislation this spring, Mr. Speaker, with 

amendments to The Farm Security Act, our government will 

provide protection and opportunities for farmers and farm 

families, a new lease for the future for farm families.  The work 

of the Farm Debt Advisory Committee is to be commended for 

its current work.  The future recommendation and input by this 

committee are anxiously being awaited across this province to 

assist in moulding the overall planning process in keeping 

Saskatchewan farmers and farm families on the farm, to ensure 

that we don't lose another 15,000 farmers in this province as we 

did during the past 10 years of Tory administration. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our government is proposing an independent 

Environment Assessment Commission to administer a more 

open and effective assessment process for major projects which 

will again place this province as a leader in environmental 

assessment process in this country.  Protecting our park land 

and our natural habitat for wildlife is also a priority of this 

government. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- Mr. Speaker, a major initiative and undertaking 

by our government is to address the issue of quality of life and 

to do so in an efficient, caring, and responsible fashion.  For the 

past several months our Minister of Health and our government 

have been emphasizing the new approach to the health care 

delivery.  Wellness is what we call it. 

 

Today, Mr. Speaker, health care is the largest cost item on our 

budget.  The bottom line is that we can no longer afford to 

deliver services and programs from the traditional health model 

that we have grown accustomed to.  Furthermore, decisions on 

health care costs today, Mr. Speaker, cannot be made on the 

prospect of a member's 

political future by building a facility to buy a vote, as has been 

the case in the past governments. 

 

Wellness is our new plan for the next generation of medicare, a 

model based on community-centred programs and services, an 

integrated approach providing care to people and services in 

their homes and communities, because this is where people 

convalesce and thrive best, with common utilization of 

facilities, resources, and health care workers. 

 

In this province the concept of co-operation, amalgamation, 

and resource sharing are not new, as was mentioned yesterday 

by one of the members opposite.  But the process of integrating 

these services is new.  Having personally pioneered 

community-based, integrated services at a community level for 

many years and as a human service professional and from the 

perspective of people understanding wellness, our 

government's proposal of this model will truly enhance 

well-being, independence, and quality of life in this province. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- Involving the community in health care reform is 

critical, and through the appointment of a health care provincial 

council, consumers, health care providers, and community 

leaders can participate and take ownership of this new model 

because New Democratic governments include people in their 

decision-making as opposed to excluding. 

 

Mr. Speaker, within our quality of life spectrum our 

government has placed a high priority on the education of our 

children, our most precious commodities.  In this vast province, 

we recognize the need to be sensitive to the issues of high rates 

of student drop-outs, out-migration of our university students, 

accessibility to educational facilities, quality of education, and 

to improve equity and access for aboriginal students . . . 

(inaudible interjection) . . . That's right. 

 

Like in health, local government bodies, consumers, and 

professionals are pooling their resources, their skills, and their 

expertise to develop strategies to manage the changing needs 

for the '90s.  Mr. Speaker, our government's creation of the 

Saskatchewan Education Council is a welcome step to that 

partnership across the province, and further emphasizes our 

government's commitment to be responsive and sensitive to the 

needs of communities and local centres on an individual basis. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our government's current review of the 

Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences and the 

up-coming appointment to review the university's structures 

and programs and the new institute to create and enhance skill 

training for Metis people, reflects the significant investment 

our government has in enhancing educational standards and 

opportunities for our future generations. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, New Democrats put people as their first 

priority which is what makes a New Democratic government so 

fundamentally different from the previous administration and 

that of the Liberals. 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 127 

The principles of this government are those of fairness and 

those of compassion.  Mr. Speaker, in 10 years this province 

has become one of the leaders in child hunger in this country -- 

poverty in staggering numbers.  Ten years of Tory government 

that has built the debt in this province that will take decades to 

erase, not because they spent the money on our disadvantaged, 

on our poor, and on our hungry children.  Not at all.  They gave 

it to their friends, on megaprojects, and on themselves.  That's 

who comes first for Tory administrations. 

 

Hungry children, Mr. Deputy Speaker, can't learn.  Hungry 

families don't function.  Hungry children are afraid.  Hungry 

children are abused, and in some instances I know personally 

that hungry children die.  An issue that the previous 

administration, Mr. Deputy Speaker, through their members 

and through their individuals who were responsible for the 

Social Service ministries, from Melville and from Rosthern, in 

my mind were totally oblivious to. 

 

Attacking poverty is our very first priority and I am pleased to 

say, on a sad note, occurring in a province like Saskatchewan 

which is supposed to be, Mr. Deputy Speaker, the bread basket 

of this country. But our government will be enhancing hunger 

and nutrition programs and will work with communities to 

alleviate child hunger and poverty. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, our government 

agenda is clear.  Today in this great province we have a 

challenge before us that is unprecedented by no other period in 

the history of provincial government -- a staggering Tory debt, 

several major Tory financial commitments that are high risk, 

bad privatization deals, an abandonment of commitment to the 

federal level of government on health, social programs, and 

agriculture, food banks across the province, hungry children 

and poverty; our Crown assets have been sold off, our money is 

gone, the cupboard is bare.  Not a pretty picture the past Tory 

administration painted for the province of Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our blueprint of this throne speech for this term is 

that we are all in this project together of rebuilding 

Saskatchewan.  Together we will reduce the deficit.  We will 

have open and accountable government.  And together we will 

be the hope for the disadvantaged, for the farmers, for the 

workers of this province, for the hungry, and for the poor. 

 

Governments, Mr. Deputy Speaker, are not all the same.  For 

us as a New Democratic government, people come first.  And 

throughout this term I know that our government will develop 

its policies and implement change with compassion through the 

democratic process of consultation and inclusion. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: -- Because, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Saskatchewan is 

our community and together we're going to rebuild it.  Thank 

you very much. 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

(1200) 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.  Mr. 

Speaker, how can anyone in Saskatchewan believe a single 

word contained in this throne speech.  How can they? After the 

course of deception the NDP have taken the Saskatchewan 

people on, or should I say the back-seat ride that the people of 

Saskatchewan have been taken on, who can believe a word that 

falls from their lips? 

 

Mr. Speaker, the NDP members across the floor have no regard 

or respect for the Saskatchewan people.  They give the 

Saskatchewan people no credit whatsoever.  Do they really 

think, do they really believe, that the people have forgotten the 

promises they made before forming government?  Do they 

honestly believe that they have the mandate to inflict such pain 

on the people of our province? 

 

I say, Mr. Speaker, that this NDP government has inflicted 

more pain on the people of Saskatchewan in seven months than 

any government in the history of our province -- more pain 

than any government, any government ever, in the history of 

Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, the previous government did not hide the 

fact that there was a deficit.  Never did they tell the people 

there was an over-abundance of money.  The previous 

government went to great lengths to inform the people of the 

state of the province's finances. 

 

And let me quote a Leader-Post columnist: 

 

 The excuse we've been given (by the NDP) is that the fiscal 

problem is far worse than they expected.  There is probably 

some truth to that, but the fact the province is broke, deep in 

debt and the economy flat is hardly news. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, that's from the Leader-Post of April 16, 

1992. 

 

The previous government went to great lengths to let the 

people know where money was being spent.  Although times 

were tough, Mr. Speaker, at budget time the previous 

government was able to maintain funding or increase funding 

in areas such as health, education, and agriculture.  The PC 

(Progressive Conservative) administration was able to do this, 

Mr. Speaker, by making choices and setting priorities.  Mr. 

Speaker, some of the decisions were not easy, but they enabled 

the government to maintain funding levels. 

 

How did the NDP members react to the previous 

administration's budgets, Mr. Speaker?  They cried foul.  They 

demanded -- demanded, Mr. Speaker -- that more money be 

spent.  Never did a day go by when the members opposite 

didn't claim that health was underfunded.  Not a day went by 

without them demanding more money for health care, that 

more money be spent on education, that our youth were being 

denied their rightful future, that more money be spent on 

agriculture, that social assistance rates be increased, that 



128 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

the minimum wage be increased, that the government wasn't 

paying nurses, teachers, the SGEU (Saskatchewan Government 

Employees' Union) employees enough money.  And the list 

goes on. 

 

We all remember those days, Mr. Speaker.  It's all recorded in 

Hansard.  It's in the public record.  It was reported all over the 

newspapers all over this province, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Now we hear the NDP government denying that they knew the 

state of the government coffers.  They claim they didn't know 

there was no money.  Well, they must have been the only ones.  

They must have been the only people in Saskatchewan not to 

know.  I know that their supporters knew there was no money 

when I visited them on the doorsteps. 

 

Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to 

figure out that the government cannot continue to spend money 

-- no matter what on -- a government cannot continue to spend 

without taking in revenue. 

 

But apparently that's what the NDP thought.  After all, they 

unilaterally opposed harmonization.  Yes they did, Mr. 

Speaker.  They opposed 7 cents on a price of a hamburger, Mr. 

Speaker.  Quite bluntly, they claimed it would destroy 

Saskatchewan; that people would lose their jobs; that 

businesses would close; that children would go hungry. 

 

Mr. Speaker, they chose to eliminate harmonization, a selective 

tax, a tax that affected higher income earners.  What a wise 

choice.  What a wise choice.  They chose to eliminate 7 cents 

on the price of a hamburger and rather to increase the price of 

heating a home. 

 

Let's stop and think about that for a moment.  Let's think about 

the low income families.  How often, Mr. Speaker, do lower 

income families treat themselves to a McDonald's hamburger -- 

not often.  It's not often they can afford to do so. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, how often do low income families pay their 

heating bills?  Every month, Mr. Speaker.  How often do they 

pay their phone bill?  How often do they pay their natural gas 

bill?  And if they have a car, how often must they buy a 

licence?  Every year, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our low income people in Saskatchewan do not 

have a choice.  They cannot choose as to whether or not they 

will heat their homes.  They can't.  After all, we live in 

Saskatchewan.  They have to heat their homes. 

 

And what is the alternative?  This government had a choice.  

They did not have to increase all the utility rates.  They did not 

have to increase the cost of insuring a vehicle.  SGI has a rate 

stabilization fund.  Why were insurance rates increased?  Why, 

Mr. Speaker, if times are so tough, why, Mr. Speaker, did the 

government allow the president of SaskPower and the 

executive vice-president of SaskPower such enormous car 

allowances? 

 

Why was Jack Messer driving a brand-new Lexus ES 300 at 

the taxpayers' expense? 

Why was Carole Bryant driving a brand-new Lexus ES 300 at 

the taxpayers' expense?  Luxury cars -- and as quoted in the 

paper -- for Lexus lefties. 

 

Why, Mr. Speaker, are they renovating their executive offices 

at SaskPower?  Carole Bryant -- remember her, she deals with 

the soft side of SaskPower.  Carole Bryant's response to the car 

issue was, and I quote from the Leader-Post on April 15, 1992: 

 

 The (car) allowances are standard for Crown executives, and 

contended cars are important to (the corporate) image. 

 

In the same article, Mr. Speaker, Carole Bryant stated: 

 

 If you had your chief executive officer driving a beat-up old 

Chev with rust on it, you've got to wonder about the 

corporate image that's portraying. 

 

The corporate image, Mr. Deputy Speaker, now there's a 

priority.  There's a priority. 

 

Mr. Speaker, Sam Walton drove a beat-up old Chevy.  Mr. 

Speaker, Sam Walton only had billions of U.S. dollars.  He 

started and built the WAL-MART department store chain.  

Sam Walton's image priority was with service, not with being 

seen as a high-flyer.  But the NDP can't have their top 

patronage appointments driving ugly cars.  How would it look? 

 

I know how the existing situation looks, Mr. Speaker.  It looks 

like waste and mismanagement to me.  It was only after it was 

in the media that the patronage appointment executives handed 

in their car keys, apparently for cheaper models. 

 

Isn't it funny how they handed in their keys just before the 

House went in session.  I guess the member from Regina 

Elphinstone didn't want to have to answer to this outrageous 

example of waste, mismanagement, and patronage.  And was 

this an isolated example, Mr. Speaker?  Only at SaskPower?  

What kind of cars do the other patronage appointments drive?  

Do they all, as the Leader-Post phrases it, pocket $10,000 a 

year in car allowance cheques? 

 

While the NDP are taking from the public in rate increases, 

they are heaping loads of privileges on to their friends.  Sure 

sounds like waste and mismanagement to me, Mr. Speaker.  

Looks like they are once again attempting to pull the wool over 

the public's eyes.  They are following through with their 

agenda.  They are continuing to tell the people one thing and 

proceeding to do exactly the opposite. 

 

Mr. Speaker, they are doing it to their own caucus.  I would 

like to know how many of the back-bench MLAs knew that 

once the NDP formed government that their election promises 

would be totally ignored.  How many of those folks across the 

floor knew that their upper echelon members would kibosh 

each and every promise that was made to the Saskatchewan 

people.  Did they ever dream that they would have to defend 

health care premiums or, Mr. Speaker, cuts to education or cuts 

to revenue-sharing grants or the gutting of the GRIP program?  

Did they  



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 129 

believe that the PST would be removed, or were they as 

surprised as many of those who voted for them that they still 

had to pay the E&H tax? 

 

I would like to know how many of the rural MLAs realized 

how bitter and vindictive their party is.  Did they ever dream 

that their NDP government would so viciously attack rural 

Saskatchewan?  I wasn't surprised.  None of my colleagues 

were.  I'll tell you who was surprised, Mr. Deputy Speaker; 

those who live in rural Saskatchewan were surprised.  After all 

they helped to vote this government in.  After all, Mr. Speaker, 

they believed the NDP's empty promises.  The NDP should 

have told the truth.  They should have told the truth that they 

would embark on the wholesale destruction of rural 

Saskatchewan. 

 

Let's reflect on what the NDP government has done for rural 

Saskatchewan.  What did they do about decentralization, a 

program that many small towns and villages in Saskatchewan 

were counting on?  The NDP, after promising during the 

election to consider each move on a case-by-case basis, the 

NDP government cancelled decentralization outright.  Mr. 

Speaker, on May 30, 1991, the following appeared in the 

Regina Leader-Post: the opposition says it won't reverse the 

Agriculture department's move to the Humboldt area if it forms 

government. 

 

The member from Humboldt, the former Agriculture critic said 

on May 29, 1991, on CKCK radio that: we will continue this 

process of decentralization.  The member from Quill Lakes that 

very same day was quoted in the Saskatoon Star-Phoenix 

stating: the NDP isn't opposed to decentralization. 

 

On June 10 the member from Saskatoon Riversdale said: for 

the PCs to say that we would cancel Fair Share is an outright 

lie -- Tisdale Recorder, June 10, 1991.  On June 13, 1991, the 

member for Saskatoon Riversdale said: the NDP will freeze the 

Fair Share program and then evaluate each program moved 

against six criteria -- Star-Phoenix, June 13, 1991.  The NDP 

also said they would not move any employees back who had 

already been decentralized.  This is the one promise they kept, 

Mr. Speaker.  It made headlines because the one employee who 

did move to Hudson Bay from Regina was fired -- a single 

mother who moved early so that her child would not have to 

move during the school year.  The NDP did nothing but fire the 

one employee who moved because it was in her family's best 

interest. 

 

(1215) 

 

Mr. Speaker, this is an uncaring government -- an uncaring and 

vindictive government.  This example proves how vindictive 

they can be.  Imagine.  They fired a single mother because she 

moved to Hudson Bay.  She moved for her job, Mr. Speaker, or 

so she thought.  Perhaps she was fired because she moved 

against the union's wishes.  Perhaps the government was 

keeping the union happy by firing this single mother or, Mr. 

Speaker, perhaps because it was the best way for the 

government to illustrate its distaste for decentralization. 

 

Whatever the reason, Mr. Speaker, it will not be good 

enough.  Whatever the reasons, whatever the excuse, it could 

never compensate for the heartache and concern that this 

woman must have experienced or may still be experiencing 

after being fired. 

 

Mr. Speaker, this is an uncaring government, an uncaring 

government who is conducting an all-out assault on rural 

Saskatchewan, an all-out assault.  Let me give you some 

examples, Mr. Speaker, to drive home my point.  Mr. Speaker, 

one of the first acts of the NDP government was to contact all 

rural hospital boards and tell them that no new health care 

facilities would be allowed in rural Saskatchewan -- no new 

hospitals. 

 

The next item on their agenda was the rural school system.  

The NDP government started a low-key campaign to convince 

people of the need to close rural schools.  Mr. Speaker, they 

even put a number on it.  Mr. Speaker, any school division with 

fewer than 700 students was apparently scheduled to be 

eliminated.  You would be hard pressed, Mr. Speaker, to find 

many school divisions in rural Saskatchewan with more than 

700 students. 

 

Mr. Speaker, seeing that the NDP are doing their best to tear 

down rural Saskatchewan, they are doing all they can to drive 

folks out of their towns and villages.  They have decided to 

withdraw the electoral boundaries.  They have said they will 

redraw the electoral boundaries to reduce the number of rural 

constituencies and increase the number of constituencies in 

Regina and Saskatoon. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the NDP government plans to eliminate the 

Department of Rural Development, the co-ordinated voice of 

rural people throughout Saskatchewan.  It will be amalgamated 

into Community Services.  Mr. Speaker, at the SARM 

(Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities) 

convention the NDP announced they will be eliminating many 

rural municipalities.  They have extended the idea further to 

include the elimination of towns and villages in a massive 

rationalization effort. 

 

Mr. Speaker, if the NDP government believed that churches 

were of any value to rural Saskatchewan, they would eliminate 

them also. 

 

The NDP government made changes to GRIP that farmers have 

made clear that they do not like.  Perhaps farmers do not like it 

because the majority of them can not afford it.  The changes 

will award the farmers with good crops and penalize those with 

poor crops.  What kind of safety-net program is that? 

 

Mr. Speaker, down at Carnduff the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool 

held a meeting to discuss GRIP.  One of the members of the 

GRIP committee was there in attendance to explain the new 

GRIP program.  Approximately 150 farmers were there. 

 

After the GRIP committee member explained the program, 

there were a number of questions. And the first person to stand 

up, Mr. Speaker, was an older gentleman who said he had been 

farming for more than 40 years.  In that time period he had 

seen a number of government programs come and go and never 

in his wildest dreams, he said, did he ever hope to receive a 

program that would 



130 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

cover him for 100 per cent of his production. 

 

The 1991 program, Mr. Speaker, he said, gave him that.  The 

1992 program takes it all away again.  And, Mr. Speaker, this 

gentleman, well-known in his community, is also well-known 

as a strong supporter of the government.  I'm not sure, Mr. 

Speaker, now how strong that support is. 

 

A question was asked at that meeting, Mr. Speaker, how many 

people there were in favour of the 1992 GRIP program.  And, 

Mr. Speaker, this is at a Saskatchewan Wheat Pool meeting.  

Mr. Speaker, not a single farmer there was in favour of the 

1992 GRIP program. 

 

But to be fair, the chairman asked the following question: how 

many people would like to return to the 1991 program?  Mr. 

Speaker, over three-quarters of the farmers in that room that 

night wanted 1991 back.  I believe that's a clear indication, Mr. 

Speaker, along with all the rallies that are happening around 

this province, in Shaunavon, at the Agridome in Regina, 

Paradise Hills, and the various meetings put on by the 

Department of Agriculture to try and explain their GRIP 

program, where the farmers are complaining in hordes that they 

do not like the new GRIP program. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the NDP have also eliminated the rural 

gasification program.  They no longer subsidize farmers' access 

to this natural resource.  They can no longer afford it, Mr. 

Speaker, because it is going to cost each farmer over $12,000 a 

mile from the nearest gas source to hook up gas to their 

operation.  Mr. Speaker, there was only about 10 per cent left 

to do in this province.  That would have created a large amount 

of employment this summer -- jobs that are desperately needed 

in Saskatchewan -- and the program was eliminated.  Why? 

 

Mr. Speaker, as you can see from the examples I've cited, the 

NDP have been engaged in a kind of guerrilla warfare against 

rural Saskatchewan.  I can go on.  The NDP put a $20-a-day 

user fee on rural cancer patients who must stay in the Regina 

cancer clinic.  A user fee, Mr. Speaker, on health care.  If you 

don't have to stay overnight, you don't have to pay.  The NDP 

government no longer pays Crown leaseholders their surface 

rights fees for oil and gas wells.  They have increased the stud 

fees in community pastures to $35 a cow.  The community 

bond program has been frozen except of course for Piper 

Aircraft. 

 

Mr. Speaker, when you put this NDP package together with 

other government policies that penalize rural Saskatchewan, it 

is difficult not to believe there was a carefully thought out and 

dishonest plan to ensure that rural Saskatchewan loses its 

social, political, and economic base of existence. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the NDP accused the PC Party of creating a 

rural-urban split in Saskatchewan.  I ask you: who is carrying 

out this attack on rural Saskatchewan?  Who is making this 

perceived split a reality?  The NDP government.  The NDP 

government is carrying out an attack on the rural residents of 

Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the NDP finally had the courage to call the 

legislature back.  We in opposition now have an 

opportunity to question the NDP on actions such as the ones I 

just mentioned.  Mr. Speaker, many people had high 

expectations from the NDP government. 

 

It is obvious from this throne speech that once again the people 

will be disappointed -- disappointed by the lack of vision and 

the broken promises.  Mr. Speaker, the government's very own 

MLAs are disappointed.  Why else would we have seen the 

number of budget leaks preceding this House being called to 

session?  Why else would the member from Regina Rosemont 

be the first to say, it wasn't me who leaked the information.  

Was it because he would have been the first accused?  I'm sure 

the member from Rosemont was very vocal during caucus 

meetings; vocal enough that he had to claim innocence before 

being accused. 

 

These are interesting and trying times we live in, Mr. Speaker, 

particularly for the NDP government and its disillusioned 

caucus.  More devastating to Saskatchewan is the fact that 

these people are running our government.  Mr. Speaker, we on 

this side of the House will continue to offer positive 

alternatives to the government.  We will offer solutions that 

will work, Mr. Speaker.  Thank you. 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy 

Speaker, and I want to thank my colleagues for the very warm 

applause and welcome to this debate.  I rise today with a great 

deal of pleasure to add a few words in support of the motion 

with respect to the Speech from the Throne as read by Her 

Honour the Lieutenant Governor. 

 

But before I do so, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I believe this is the 

first time that I've had an opportunity to address the House 

since the election a few months ago, and what I want to do is to 

communicate to you, sir, as Deputy Speaker, my 

congratulations on your elevation to this very important 

position.  Of course also to Mr. Speaker.  The two of you are 

very important officers of the Assembly, and I know that you'll 

acquit yourselves with dignity and the appropriate competence 

that we have come to expect of you. 

 

And as well, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I want to congratulate all the 

members who were successful in the election campaign of 

October of 1991.  A special word of congratulations to the 

first-time members who have won election. 

 

I don't know how you have felt or are feeling about the 

experience, but I can tell you about my own -- looking back at 

it now, many years ago -- the sense of kind of exhilaration and 

wonderment and intimidation and awe and high expectation, 

and then some frustration that enters into the system because 

the system does have a way of, in a way, leavening the high 

expectations which we bring.  But at the end of the day I 

accepted very early that there probably could be no higher 

honour bestowed on any person in a civilized, democratic 

community than that honour of being elected to a legislative 

body, municipally, legislatively, provincially or federally. 

 

When you stop to think of the number of people who are in this 

province and the actual few number that have had the privilege 

of sitting in the Chamber, we are indeed a very select group.  I 

don't say this from any elitist point of 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 131 

view, far from it.  When I say select group, I really say this 

from the point of view of a group which has a very high trust 

on it, a very high onus to act as honestly and as capably as we 

can in the best interests of all of the people of the province of 

Saskatchewan. 

 

And I think that if we approach our duties from that standard, 

from that point of view, regardless of what particular ideology 

we may carry, then this legislature will be well served and the 

people of this province will be very well served. 

 

And I want to congratulate all of the members who have been 

elected, each and every one of us.  But a special welcome to the 

newcomers and a special word to them.  We want your new 

ideas.  We want your contribution to the process of building a 

better Saskatchewan for the 1990s. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Now, Mr. Speaker, I intend this 

morning, in the time left to me, to basically discuss with you 

what I believe is the main mandate given to us by the people of 

Saskatchewan in the election of a few months ago. 

 

As I see it, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that mandate was a mandate to 

end and to turn the corner, to end nine years of practices and 

philosophies which have at the end of nine years brought this 

province to its knees.  They have not destroyed the province, 

because thankfully the people of this community called 

Saskatchewan are stronger than any ideology or any political 

party. 

 

(1230) 

 

But after nine years of privatizations, nine years of enormous 

expenditures, nine years of enormous taxation with little to 

show for it except a massive debt, a lot of heartache, a lot of 

hurt for ordinary people on the farms or in the towns, the 

villages, the cities, the people in October said to us, the New 

Democrats: you are elected to put an end to that; you are 

elected to turn the corner and try your best to redirect the 

Government of Saskatchewan and this province along the lines 

that historically is this province, the lines of co-operation and 

community and compassion; to provide opportunity, to provide 

hope, to provide some vision for the people, to provide them 

some sense of community that we can overcome, not only the 

misdeeds of the government opposite, but the many challenges 

which we face in the global eyes of the world that is the 1990s. 

 

That is what I see is the main mandate.  And in six months, Mr. 

Deputy Speaker, I doubt that few governments have been as 

active and as successful in tackling that mandate as we have 

been. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- In the six months since the election, 

and I will spare you the description of the various events, this 

government has acted decisively and quickly.  We have the 

smallest cabinet in 20 years.  We saved over $28 million in 

various expenditure cuts to 

government programs.  We have no legislative secretaries.  

That's not to say that we don't need them or that we don't need 

more cabinet ministers.  The cabinet and the caucus is 

overworked as in this period of transition it tries to get a handle 

on the finances and turn things around. 

 

We've eliminated the trade offices in Hong Kong and 

Minneapolis and Zürich, other far-away, exotic places 

populated by the members of the governing party of the day, 

saving millions again. 

 

I noted that the speaker of the Conservative Party who spoke 

just before I did was referring to the cars and the automobiles 

of the Power Corporation president currently, and one of the 

vice-presidents.  And he is correct, as he's described the story, 

in part, but only in part. 

 

What he has refused to tell the people in this Chamber is of 

course that the president followed identically the policies with 

respect to the purchases of cars which that former government 

instituted and implemented and adopted for nine years.  

Perhaps we should have been more sensitive to the fact that 

they were in existence. 

 

None the less, in a way there is a silver lining behind every 

cloud, if I can put it that way.  And the silver lining in this 

situation is that unlike the Conservatives, we have indicated 

that there shall be no continuation of those kinds of perks and 

policies and that there is . . . 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- We've changed it -- a new direction.  

In fact my colleague, the minister in charge of the Power 

Corporation, gives me a memorandum which describes how the 

past president, George Hill, of the Power Corporation leased a 

Cadillac with his executive car allowance.  In '87 the executive 

car allowances for Crown corporation presidents was 481.  By 

1991, Mr. Deputy Speaker, by 1991 the party opposite had 

increased this car perk from this amount to $850, or an increase 

of 100 per cent, which now of course the member opposite 

attacks us for. 

 

And he's right. We shouldn't have adopted that approach.  But 

he is wrong, and I'm telling him and the people of this 

Assembly and the public that when this review of Crown perks 

is completed, and on this particular one that kind of outrageous 

expenditure will not be tolerated by this government and is not 

being tolerated by this government. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- So we have taken many steps in six 

months.  But as I said, I was not going to talk about that 

because that in itself is a lengthy speech, and time does not 

permit this morning. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about, in the context of the 

mandate, what it was that we specifically offered the people of 

Saskatchewan during the election campaign.  And then I want 

to describe briefly how we're making out in the six months in 

the context of the Speech from the 



132 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

Throne. 

 

I have here in front of me, sir, the New Democratic Party 

campaign platform for the October 1991 general election.  

You'll see it's called "The Saskatchewan Way," "Let's do it the 

Saskatchewan Way".  And it's a relatively small document, 

concise, printed on both sides.  I remember all too well when 

the document was revealed at an appropriate press conference 

during the course of the campaign, the then premier, now 

Leader of the Opposition, saying, is that all there is?  Is that the 

NDP plan?  Where is the plan, was the argument.  Is this all 

you're campaigning on? 

 

And the answer was, yes.  We're campaigning on this.  We 

want to receive the approval and the mandate of the people of 

Saskatchewan to do this.  And if we can accomplish this within 

four years, we will have fulfilled that over-all direction of 

which I have just spoken a moment or so ago, Mr. Deputy 

Speaker, namely we will have turned the corner and changed 

the path of nine years of destructive mismanagement and waste 

and privatizations and all the things that the people of 

Saskatchewan got so fed up of that they defeated virtually 

every one of them except the small rump group which sits to 

your left. 

 

I want to review this, and I want to review this platform card in 

the context of the Speech from the Throne, "The Saskatchewan 

Way".  It says as follows: 

 

 It's time to renew the Saskatchewan community.  Working 

together, we can turn our economy around in the 1990's and 

ignite the spirit of community which built Saskatchewan.  

The values of co-operation, compassion and fairness can help 

build a future of hope, opportunity, and prosperity for all 

Saskatchewan people. 

 

That was the preamble.  And now the specifics: 

 

 First Things First (this pamphlet said) -- Common Sense 

Financial Management. 

 

I repeat again to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, first things first -- 

that was our platform -- common sense financial management. 

 

And we had three specific items under this platform: 

 

 Open the books. A public, independent audit of the province's 

financial affairs to cut government waste and 

mismanagement. 

 

 (Secondly) A comprehensive review of all PC privatizations 

and business deals, to determine if they are in the public 

interest. 

 

 (And thirdly) A balanced budget in our first term of office, 

and a 15-year plan to eliminate the accumulated Devine 

Deficit (end quote). 

 

That is what we stood for on the first things first, common 

sense financial management proposal that we made to the 

people of the province of Saskatchewan. 

I want to say a word about this.  How far have we come in six 

months in fulfilling this four-year program?  Well first things 

first, we did open the books.  And we designated a committee 

headed by Don Gass, subject of a lot of debate — I would add 

a lot of debate and comment unbecoming of parliamentarians, 

mainly from the members opposite who attacked four people, 

three of whom volunteered their services without pay in public 

interest and devoted many hours and effort to do the study of 

opening up the books; an attack on an individual like Mr. Don 

Gass who politically is not associated with the government of 

the day politically, and is a very, very well acknowledged and 

reputable chartered accountant in his field.  I think those kinds 

of comments belittle the political process, and they continue to 

this day. 

 

This document tells the story.  Open the books has 

demonstrated that what we suspected all along since the budget 

of 1987 right after the PCs got elected, which was so wildly out 

of whack from what they said it would be in 1986, what we 

suspected was correct.  This province is on the virtual brink of 

bankruptcy, that the debt is now $9 billion if nationally 

accepted accounting standards are adopted, and that in the 

course of the examination, a litany, a horrible litany, of the 

kinds of wasteful mispractices and expenditure mispractices 

that I've talked about are documented in this Gass report. 

 

Again time doesn't permit me, but I just want to give you one 

example, reading on page 81, talking about the transactions, the 

following is said by this commission: 

 

 The timing of the sale of the Province's shares in the Potash 

Corporation of Saskatchewan (get these words, Mr. Deputy 

Speaker) was contrary to the advice provided by the Crown 

Management Board's external advisors . . . (contrary to the 

advisors) Unless an argument is mounted that the assets of 

the company were overstated, we have concluded that the 

timing of the issue resulted in a loss to the province. 

 

How much of a loss?  Four hundred and forty-one million 

dollars loss to the province of Saskatchewan in this Gass 

report. 

 

There are numerous other examples: the Rafferty experience, 

Cameco.  I can go on and on to describe those.  The fact of the 

matter is that the Gass books finally put the province's financial 

record out there for the sun to shine in and for everybody to see 

and it has given us a proper financial base from which now, in 

reality and realism, we can fashion our budget and plan the 

next four years.  So we did open up the books. 

 

The second thing that we promised here was a comprehensive 

review of PC privatizations.  We did that too, Mr. Deputy 

Speaker.  I have here in front of me a document called Crown 

Investments Corporation, a study done by Ernst & Young - 

_ all members will know is an internationally accepted large, 

reputable chartered accountants firm. 

 

This is a study of the Crown corporations side of the ledger.  

And here, as in the Gass situation, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we've 

seen nine years of a horrible 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 133 

mismanagement of affairs.  Today, according to Ernst & 

Young, the corporation's accumulated debt is $2.9 billion.  I'm 

talking about plus to the $9 billion of Gass. 

 

It says, this report, that $875 million is what they called dead 

weight loss, namely the money which was borrowed against 

certain assets.  Those assets no longer exist, or if they exist, 

they're not able to generate enough revenue to pay off the 

interest charges and it's a dead weight loss. 

 

Let me give you an example of what I mean by some of the 

dead weight losses identified by Ernst & Young: 361 on a 

privatization of PCS (Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan); 

118 SEDCO (Saskatchewan Economic Development 

Corporation) non-recoverable losses; forest products -- the 

secret Saskatchewan diversification corporation.  One could go 

on and on, including our good old friend, GigaText. 

 

And one that I found interesting, a diversion of $312 million in 

the years '89-90 and '90-91 from Crown Management Board, a 

diversion from those dividends again contrary to the advice of 

the officials of Crown Management over to the treasurer in 

order to keep the size of the deficits down.  In fact they forced, 

according to this report of Ernst & Young, the Crown 

corporations, which were on a sounder financial footing, to 

borrow money just to make payments over to the treasury to 

keep the size of the debt down.  And you don't have to be 

genius to figure out that you can't finance any corporation, or 

for that matter any organization, on that basis for a very, very 

long time. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I'm going to table for this legislature a 

report under date of December 16, 1991 prepared by Deloitte & 

Touche which takes out one aspect of the Ernst & Young report 

and describes how the Crown Management Board carried out 

the process of emptying its coffers in order to try to make it 

look like the deficit was not as large as it really was.  And I 

here am now referring with respect to this report which the 

members I hope will get, on page 2.  And it says this -- it's a 

very short chronology:  the board of directors of CMB (Crown 

Management Board) met on December 13, 1990. 

 

I'll stop here to add the board of members included the minister 

of Finance as he then was, Mr. Hepworth, and the premier as 

he then was, the member from Estevan.  And during the 

meeting dealt with the payment of a dividend -- that's a fancy 

word for transferring funds from the Crown corporations -- to 

the Heritage Fund in the amount of $310 million.  The amount 

was included in the revenue Estimates for the '90-91 budget, 

schedule 5. 

 

(1245) 

 

It's important to understand that by order in council dated 

December 22, 1983, CMB is prohibited from declaring 

dividends in excess of the retained earnings calculated on a 

non-calculated basis.  Now that gets a bit technical, but here's 

the part that tells the story, quote:  The documents presented to 

the CMB board of directors indicate that the management of 

CMB -- the management, my words now, the advisors -- 

believe that the corporation did not have the financial capacity 

to pay the dividend of $310 

million and that the CMB's present financial situation would 

deteriorate by this payment because of the assumption of 

additional interest-bearing debt.  In fact management 

recommended that the board not approve the payment by CMB 

of the $310 million dividend. 

 

(1245) 

 

And notwithstanding the best legal and financial advice that 

this group of people at CMB gave the board, what did they do, 

Mr. Deputy Speaker?  They in fact transferred the $310 million 

and note the timing -- December of 1990, now looking at a 

possible April budget, maybe April election.  Remember, we 

were beginning the rally round Saskatchewan series then and 

they wanted to keep that deficit somehow under manageable 

proportions.  And they did it and they did it by bankrupting the 

Crown corporations.  That's the situation.  We suspected all of 

this and during the course of the campaign raised all of these 

issues, and before the campaign raised these issues. 

 

Now, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I tabled right after question period 

today, so I won't do it again, how my suspicions were 

formulated in correspondence.  I wrote to the then premier 

under date of September 22, 1991.  And I'll read just a portion 

of this letter to you.  It says as follows: 

 

 Dear Premier: 

 

 I write concerning an issue of major importance to the people 

of Saskatchewan, that being the current state of the provincial 

government's finances.  By way of this open letter, I am 

calling upon you to agree to an independent verification of 

the provincial government's current revenue and expenditure 

statements, and the current year's deficit forecast. 

 

Listen to these words: 

 

 For the good of the province, I believe that we should agree 

on a procedure for such an independent verification prior to 

October 21st, (which as you know is election day) so that all 

the voters will have an opportunity to know the full, true 

picture of the province's financial state in advance of election 

day. 

 

From my part obviously, what promises we were to be making 

would be dependent upon the true state of the financial 

situation in Saskatchewan. 

 

And then I suggest an independent accounting expert which of 

course as you know in the letter the next few days from the 

Minister of Finance, a six-page letter which I have here, this 

idea was rejected.  Not only was it rejected, there was a 

defence of the budget and an explanation of all of the 

assumptions, including the deficit forecast and the revenue 

forecasts. 

 

And then the Minister of Finance concludes by saying, quote: 

 

 As you can see . . . I see no reason to alter our target of a 

$265 million deficit. 



134 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

That was the situation headed into the campaign. 
 

Now maybe you can call me naïve.  But I still believe that 

when a Minister of Finance under letter-head of Minister of 

Finance of the province of Saskatchewan and not under 

letter-head of the PC Party, in response to my letter to the 

premier of a province, I'm still old-fashioned enough to believe 

that when a minister of Finance writes a letter and puts his or 

her signature to that letter in a detailed six-page documentation, 

I'm naïve enough to believe that he has an obligation to tell the 

people of this province the truth.  That's what I believe. 
 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- We now know through the Gass report 

and Ernst & Young that that was the farthest thing from the 

truth.  Now we know how bad it really was. 

 

You know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, very often I get asked by 

people: Roy, what was your biggest surprise when you got into 

the Premier's office?  And for a while I couldn't quite think of a 

nice, easy answer.  And then it occurred to me that the late 

American president, J.F.K. -- John F. Kennedy -- had the best 

answer. 

 

Somebody asked Kennedy: Mr. President, what was your 

biggest surprise when you first were elected and you entered 

the Oval Office?  And Kennedy said, roughly translated, 

something like this.  He said: you know what my biggest 

surprise was?  That all those things we said about those other 

guys were actually true. 

 

That was, in a sense, my biggest surprise -- that all of the 

suspicions proved to be true and documented and worse. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, Deputy Speaker, we have a strange 

opposition logic which is entering into this debate.  Today in 

question period their logic goes like this.  They say: you know, 

we nearly bankrupted the province.  We knew that we nearly 

bankrupted the province.  Everybody knew that we cooked the 

books.  We cooked the books.  We didn't tell you the truth in 

all of these documentation.  Everyone knew that; therefore you 

shouldn't have trusted our minister of Finance when he wrote 

you the letter to say the figure was only 265. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Boy, weren't we dummies.  Everybody 

knew that the minister of Finance shouldn't have been trusted.  

They knew that their minister of Finance shouldn't have been 

trusted.  Boy oh boy, I guess we got snookered on that one, Mr. 

Deputy Speaker. 

 

Can you believe this from a responsible opposition in a crisis of 

1992?  You know, even if one . . . We can laugh a little bit 

about this, but this is a financial crisis of immense proportion.  

Mr. Speaker, even if we were to believe what they were to say, 

that everybody knew, the fact of the matter is, everybody did 

not know. 

 

I have here in front of me the Special Report By the Provincial 

Auditor dated April 21, 1992.  Again I could make a whole 

speech on what he says.  I just simply at random, page 7, quote: 

"Eight Government organizations 

 reported that they provided goods/services without charge to 

other Government organizations."  And the value totalled 

approximately 1.755 million. 

 

Nobody knew anything about it.  The auditor didn't know about 

it.  A hundred and thirty employees worked elsewhere.  

Nobody knew anything about it -- at $5.1 million. 

 

Here's one on page 11: The following corporations reported 

that they hired 32 people at a cost of $1.2 million, and the 

auditor did not know about it.  So it's not true that we knew. 

 

But they say they knew.  Now that is going to be an interesting 

little debate in the next few days because the member from 

Thunder Creek and the member from Rosthern, they say 

everybody knew and all of their speeches today are saying we 

knew and you should have known. 

 

Well then by golly, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we're going to find 

out in the next 10 days and over the budget debate exactly how 

much of this they knew -- exactly how much of this they knew. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Then there is the other argument 

which also I find strange.  The opposition then changes its 

attack.  First of all Gass is no good; now Gass is good.  Well 

maybe Gass is only partly good.  Maybe he's partly no good. 

 

Then we have Professor Sentance from Prince Edward Island.  

He's good partly but maybe not so partly good.  Barb Byers is 

good, maybe not so good.  I'm not so sure. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Everybody has some good in them. 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- And the member from Arm River says 

everybody's got a little bit of good in them.  I'll tell you, I 

would be very hard pressed to accept that proposition when it 

comes to the PC caucus. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- But my Catholic upbringing, I guess, 

has to get me to agree with the member from Arm River. 

 

But here is the other argument which I find about the 

opposition on this budget on the record, Mr. Deputy Speaker, 

which is really . . . Again, it's a joke but it's serious.  Now get 

this argument.  They say now: but you knew -- I've made that 

point.  They say now this, you know, they say that NDP 

government, they're over bloating the deficit. 

 

You know, Professor Sentance from P.E.I. says, you don't have 

to take into account the unfunded pension liabilities and add it 

to your deficit as Gass says.  Sentance says, you don't have to 

put in the $2 billion bankruptcy of the Crown corporations and 

add it into the budget.  You don't have to do that.  What you do 

is you just keep it separate and in effect, as my colleague, the 

Minister of Finance 



May 1, 1992 Saskatchewan Hansard 135 

says, just forget it and write up an ordinary budget without 

those indebtednesses being accounted for. 

 

Which is what they did for 10 years, Mr. Deputy Speaker.  But 

I tell the Conservatives opposite, whether you account for these 

indebtednesses in this budget or not, a debt here or a debt there 

still equals a debt.  And the debt is massive.  You can make 

book entries all the ways that you want.  If I wanted to take the 

PC political way out of it and make book entries on these 

various operations, I'd be continuing 10 years of the former 

administration's rule.  I'd be doing that. 

 

But I tell you, I would be not telling the people of this province 

the truth.  And they're fed up with not being told the truth.  We 

are telling it like it is.  No sugar coating on our pills.  It's time 

to turn the corner and start rebuilding this province of 

Saskatchewan on the fairness and the opportunity to be there. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- So we've opened the books.  We've 

started a review of the PC privatizations, and there'll be more to 

be said about that in the weeks and months ahead. 

 

Now comes the promise of balancing the budget in our first 

term of office.  Now that, Mr. Speaker, I've got to tell you, is 

one that we may not be able to fulfil, given the massive size of 

the fiscal fiasco we find ourselves in.  That is one which may 

be difficult for us to achieve.  We're doing the best that we can, 

but it may not be possible. 

 

But again we'll have to be judged over the next years, budgets 

ahead, as to how close we come to that.  But even if we miss it 

by a year or two, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I believe the province of 

Saskatchewan people know the size of the job ahead of us, and 

if we do miss this they will still -- seeing the proper results, 

seeing the right direction that we're headed in -- will support us 

in the approach that we take, and that this commitment will 

also be legitimately fulfilled. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Now what else did we campaign on?  

I read: "New Directions, New Priorities."  Our second plank: 

"Jobs, Fair Taxes, and Wealth Creation." Three points. One: 

 

 A commitment to save 7,500 jobs threatened by the expanded 

7% PST.  We will repeal this unfair tax. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, done.  Two: 

 

 Work with local manufacturers and businesses to increase the 

value-added processing of our resources and commodities for 

both the domestic and export markets. 

 

Done. Consulting and working and more results in the months 

and the years ahead.  Third: 

 

 Jobs and savings through a comprehensive energy 

conservation strategy and the development of new 

technology to improve the application of renewable 

resources. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, done.  The institute of energy options 

which these people opposed and which we have established is 

right into this, jobs and savings through a comprehensive 

energy conservation approach. A brand-new direction to not 

only provide jobs but to save the valuable resources.  Done, 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, and the people of Saskatchewan support 

us on that. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- Then I have the next one: "A Better 

Quality of Life." Here much more has to be done, I candidly 

admit, but we're taking steps immediately. 

 

The first point under this heading: 

 

 Work with students, families, and educators to develop a 

world class, accessible education system. 

 

Expect the Minister of Education to have much more to say 

about this in detail in the weeks and months ahead. 

 

Next one: 

 

 Commitment to a new, community-based health care system 

based on the "wellness" model. 

 

We're moving here very quickly.  Those people opposite don't 

understand this, but we are pioneering the next generation of 

medicare and health.  It's not going to be easy, but we're going 

to achieve it. 

 

The next commitment: 

 

 A commitment to Saskatchewan's Aboriginal people to 

honour land entitlements and promote self-government. 

 

We're committed to that and we're moving on the negotiations 

and in constitutionals. 

 

Next item: 

 

 Introduce an Environmental Bill of Rights to guarantee the 

public access to information and participation regarding 

environmental impacts. 

 

Done. Announced in the Speech from the Throne.  And finally: 

 

 Fair labour laws, developed in consultation with working 

people and employers to promote harmony in the workplace. 

 

Done in the Speech from the Throne in this session.  The next 

one: 

 

 Fighting for Agriculture and Rural Communities. 

 

 Fight for $500 million cash payment from the federal 

government . . . 



136 Saskatchewan Hansard May 1, 1992 

The third line of defence.  We've done that and we're going to 

continue to do that.  I say to the opposition, join us instead of 

supporting and defending the Ottawa PCs in denying this aid to 

the farmers. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: -- The other three items I can mention as 

well -- time is running out -- with respect to the Canadian 

Wheat Board and redesigning GRIP and NISA (net income 

stabilization account), fighting federal cuts and services to our 

rural communities. 

 

The last major commitment: 

 

 Open, Honest and Accountable Government. 

 

 A Code of Ethical Conduct . . . 

 

That's done, that'll be in this session. 

 

 General elections every four years, and by-elections . . . 

within six months . . . 

 

That's been done. 

 

 Restore fair and open tendering for government contracts. 

 

That's been done.  Even advertising, so that we got rid of all 

those PC advertising firms like Dome and Roberts, taking 

hundreds of thousands of dollars without fair tender -- now 

that's open tender. 

 

You see my point, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as time runs out.  This 

is our platform.  First things first -- common sense financial 

management; new directions and new priorities; a better quality 

of life; fighting for agriculture and rural communities; open, 

honest, and accountable government. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, if you look at this platform and what we 

stood on and what we were elected for and compare it to this 

Speech from the Throne, you will see that in six and a half 

months we have taken a giant step forward already to 

completing a four-year mandate within a year or two years.  

Mr. Speaker, we have turned the corner, we have put an end to 

four years of incompetent and wasteful and wrong-headed 

government.  We are building a brand-new Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have many more things to say about this 

important issue, I therefore beg leave to adjourn the debate. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 1 p.m.
