LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Fourth Session — Thirteenth Legislature 

35th Day 

 

Wednesday, March 30, 1960 

 

The House met at 2:30 o’clock p.m. 

 

WELCOME TO STUDENTS 

 

Mrs. J.E. Cooper (Regina City):  Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day, I wish to welcome a 

group of students from Regina. They are here with their teachers, Mrs. Bevlin and Mr. McNiel, and they 

come from a special interest Grade 7 class in Regina. I am sure we all welcome them here very much 

and hope they will enjoy their visit with us, and that they will profit by it. 

 

Mr. A.T. Stone (Saskatoon City):  Mr. Speaker, I too would like to welcome a group of pupils from 

St. Paul’s North School from Saskatoon, with their teachers Mr. Oliver and Mr. MacDonald. I am sure 

the members will join with me in saying how pleased we are to have them with us today, and hope that 

their trip will be an enjoyable one. 

 

NEWSPAPER CORRECTION 

 

Hon. J.T. Douglas (Minister of Highways):  Mr. Speaker, I beg to bring to your attention, this 

morning’s ‘Leader-Post’ which stated: 

 

“The Minister of Highways admitted that fees had been raised very materially since he took office.” 

 

That should read the “weights” have been very materially raised; not “fees”. There is quite a difference. 

 

The Assembly then adjourned at 5:30 o’clock p.m.
