INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to you 
and through you it’s an honour today for me to introduce a very 
good friend of mine, Krystal Kwiatkowski. I met Krystal and 
her dad over a decade ago out at Porcupine Plain at a trade 
show, and since then our friendship has grown. And she’s 
grown into a lovely lady that has moved from Porcupine to 
Regina. She’s promised me all session she’s going to come in to 
see us, and today she’s here. So welcome to your Assembly and 
thank you for coming. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Meewasin, the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wish to 
introduce to you and through you to all members of the 
Legislative Assembly some visitors from the beautiful 
constituency of Saskatoon Meewasin who are seated in the west 
gallery, Mr. Speaker. We have 33 students from St. Anne 
Elementary School with their teacher, Mr. Denis Sanche, and 
chaperones Mrs. Derksen, Mrs. McKay, Mrs. Anweiler, Mrs. 
Dumas, Mrs. Blue, and Mrs. Carter. If all members of the 
Assembly will join me in welcoming them to the Assembly. I 
hope I can meet with them to the extent that it’s possible given 
my obligations to committee work this morning, Mr. Speaker. 
Again I hope members will join me in welcoming them to the 
legislature and to the capital city. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
also want to introduce to you and through you and the members 
of the legislature a group from near Saltcoats, Saskatchewan 
from Countryside School: 11 students with their teacher, Evan 
Penner, and chaperones Doug Regehr, Viona Regehr, Bonnie 
Penner, Val Wohlgemuth, Ray Isaac, Sheryl Isaac, and Sue 
Toews. And, Mr. Speaker, I welcome them to their legislature, 
and I’m going to meet with them later and ask all members to 
welcome them here today. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Eastview. 
 

Mother’s Day 
 
Ms. Junor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Graycie Harmon once 
said that: 
 

My mom is a neverending song in my heart of comfort, 
happiness, and being. I may sometimes forget the words 

but I always remember the tune. 
 
It’s important for us to remember this, Mr. Speaker, since 
Sunday is Mother’s Day. Every year for a single day in May, 
we make a special effort to show our mothers the appreciation 
that they deserve — appreciation for a life time of devotion. 
 
Mr. Speaker, from our earliest days, mothers are the ones that 
provided us with comfort, guidance, education, and love. Mère 
in French, mother in English, nikawi in Cree — all refer to 
those women that shape our lives from the start. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to wish all the mothers in the Assembly today, on  
all of Saskatchewan’s mothers a very happy Mother’s Day. And 
I would like to close with a quote from Oliver Wendell Holmes: 
 

Youth fades; love droops, the leaves of friendship fall; A 
mother’s secret hope outlives them all. 
 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
Margaret Mead once wrote and I quote, “One of the oldest 
human needs is . . . [to have] someone wonder where you are 
. . . [and why you didn’t] come home at night.” Mr. Speaker, 
this Sunday we will celebrate mothers in our lives who, I’m 
sure at least one occasion and maybe more, wondered why we 
didn’t come home at night or were late. I know my mother had 
that opportunity on a number of occasions. 
 
On Mother’s Day, we pay tribute to the women who brought us 
into this world and who nurtured us and raised us to be the 
people we are today. Mr. Speaker, my mother watches the 
legislature Assembly every day that it’s on, is one of our 
greatest fans in here. And, Mr. Speaker, I also want to pass on 
to her that my colleague from Lloydminster, who backs me up 
every day when I’m up in question period, also wants to tell her 
that people of English and Norwegian ancestry is a great mix 
because he also has that same background. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to tell you today that my mother’s 
greatest fear is that when I’m up in question period, that at some 
point I will cross the line, and you will have me removed. I 
have reassured her, Mr. Speaker; I have reassured her that 
you’re a patient and understanding man and that will never 
happen. 
 
Mr. Speaker, our mothers are special every day of the year, but 
this Sunday just reminds us how special they are to all of us. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Douglas Park. 
 

70th Wedding Anniversary 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, May 
12, is the 70th wedding anniversary of Hubert and Elsie Elkin, 



May 10, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1579 

constituents and friends of mine. They met and were married in 
Moose Jaw and have lived most of their adult lives in Regina. 
 
Over the years, Elsie has been the strong centre of the family. 
She taught everyone the importance of caring for your family 
and looking after each other in difficult times. She encouraged 
everyone to do their best and to reach higher than they may 
have thought possible. She has made herself available again and 
again to provide support and direction to her children, including 
the member for Regina Rosemont, and her grandchildren to 
ensure they followed a good path. 
 
Hub is a lifelong activist. He has never ceased caring about 
what is happening in this world and having an opinion and 
expressing it each and every day — like the member for Regina 
Rosemont. He has a long history of putting his mouth where his 
mouth is, all to the benefit of our community and our planet. 
 
This weekend Elsie and Hub’s extended family will gather to 
acknowledge the importance and good fortune of 70 years of 
health, continuity of relationship, and principled living. Mr. 
Speaker, Hub and Elsie Elkin epitomize a generation whose 
primary focus was not only on the care of their children, 
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren but also on the 
well-being of their community. Their anniversary allows us all 
to celebrate those people in our lives who choose the path of 
working through their problems and providing continuity to our 
lives and our efforts to build a better world. Happy anniversary, 
Elsie and Hub. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 

Love Your Neighbour Fundraising Banquet 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, last 
night I and several of our legislative colleagues joined more 
than 1,000 people at the fourth annual Love Your Neighbour 
fundraising banquet at the Conexus Arts Centre. This was the 
first year the event was hosted by the new joint venture known 
as Souls Harbour Rescue Mission. 
 
Last night Ken Porter, the CEO [chief executive officer] of the 
mission, reported on 10 miracles that have happened to that 
organization this past year. And they include the following: the 
merger of Souls Harbour and the Regina Rescue Mission in 
January into a larger, more effective organization, the relocation 
of both missions to a renovated building on Halifax Street, the 
paying off of $270,000 in mortgage on the life change program 
building, the purchase of Sacred Heart Church, the opening of a 
new women’s home in the rectory of that church, a new men’s 
family wing, two new chapel ministries, the serving of more 
than 100,000 nutritious meals in the last year, and finally many 
lives changed for the better as evidenced by the graduates of the 
life change program last night. 
 
Mr. Speaker, last evening’s guests were also treated to a 
wonderful performance by Juno award winning artist Steve 
Bell. And I would like to ask now all members of this Assembly 
to join me in thanking everyone involved in the Souls Harbour 
Rescue Mission for the amazing and much needed work they do 

in this city. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Walsh Acres. 
 

Showcasing the Talents of Young People 
 
Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s 
International Youth Week, a time to recognize the 
achievements, talents, and contributions that young people 
make to their communities and to the province as a whole. 
Earlier this week I had the opportunity to attend an event that 
reminded me of the wide range of opportunities available to 
young people here in Saskatchewan and the many areas of 
interest in which they can apply their talents. 
 
For the last three years Avant-Garde College here in Regina has 
hosted a fashion show event as a fundraiser to provide full 
bursaries for students wishing to study aesthetics and 
cosmetology, and I had the great pleasure of attending this 
year’s show. It was a remarkable event, Mr. Speaker, with 
hundreds in attendance and consisted of a fashion show 
featuring the work of six young Saskatchewan-based fashion 
designers, many of whom are already well known on the 
national stage, as well as a fantasy competition to showcase the 
talents of a team of fashion specialists. 
 
The winners of this year’s fantasy competition were the Frozen 
Masquerade entry by April Schoenthal, Ashley Nelson, Diana 
Peigan, Mandy Leonard, and Joezi Ulvild. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank everyone involved with this year’s 
event, in particular co-ordinators Lori Pawson and Margaret 
Titanich, for providing this excellent opportunity to showcase 
the talents of young Saskatchewan people. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Melfort. 
 

World Lupus Day 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today is the 
fourth annual World Lupus Day, a day set aside to increase 
awareness of the disease, to promote diagnosis, treatment, and 
research for a cure. On this day lupus organizations worldwide 
campaign for increases in funding for research into lupus, 
educational campaigns for patients, health professionals, and 
the general public, as well as global acknowledgement of lupus 
as a significant public heath issue. 
 
A complex disease affecting many aspects of life for more than 
50,000 Canadians, lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease that 
can strike any tissue or organ in the body. Mr. Speaker, one of 
the frustrating aspects of this disease is that the symptoms of 
lupus can mimic other illnesses, making it very difficult to 
diagnose. That’s why early detection, diagnosis, and treatment 
of lupus helps to slow its debilitating effects. Mr. Speaker, 
effective treatment lupus can minimize symptoms, reduce 
inflammation, and improve a patient’s overall quality of life. 
 



1580 Saskatchewan Hansard May 10, 2007 

By observing World Lupus Day we can make a difference for 
those living with lupus by helping to increase awareness and 
understanding of the disease, and improving awareness of lupus 
symptoms that can literally save lives. Mr. Speaker, I’d ask all 
members of this Assembly to join me in recognizing World 
Lupus Day 2007. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[10:15] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Meewasin. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As have been 
noted, today is World Lupus Day. Lupus is a potentially fatal 
autoimmune disease capable of damaging virtually any part of 
the body, including the skin, heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain. In 
its most severe form lupus can cause disfiguring rashes and 
scaring; multiple miscarriages; kidney, heart, and lung failure; 
and paraneuralogical functions — strokes, heart attacks, and 
even death. 
 
More than five million people worldwide have a form of lupus. 
Nine out ten people with lupus are women. Eighty per cent of 
new lupus cases are diagnosed amongst women ages 15 to 44. 
Despite its enormous public health implications, lupus remains 
a dangerously under-recognized and underappreciated women’s 
health issue. 
 
World Lupus Day is observed each year to bring worldwide 
attention to the often debilitating effects of lupus and to act as a 
call to action for governments around the world to increase their 
financial support for lupus medical research, awareness, and 
patient services. Medical research efforts into lupus and the 
discovery of safer, more effective treatments for lupus patients 
are underfunded in comparison with diseases of comparable 
magnitude and severity. 
 
Lupus organizations around the world, such as the Lupus 
Erythematosus Society of Saskatchewan or LESS, are also 
striving for targeted education programs for health 
professionals, patients, and the public. I commend the 
organizations involved with lupus and World Lupus Day in 
their mission to gain worldwide recognition of lupus as a 
significant public health issue. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosthern-Shellbrook. 
 

Future of Prince Albert Pulp Mill 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, what is going on with this NDP [New Democratic 
Party] government? In March the Minister Responsible for the 
Forestry Secretariat announced in front of a room full of people 
in P.A. [Prince Albert] that there was a deal with Domtar. 
Domtar had to clarify with the media that there was no such 
deal. Yesterday the minister held a news conference to say that 

there was no deal with Domtar and that Domtar was selling 
their assets. Domtar had to again go to the media to clarify their 
position because the minister again got it wrong. 
 
To the minister, Mr. Speaker: does the minister even speak to 
Domtar before he misinforms the public about the company’s 
intentions? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister 
Responsible for the Forestry Secretariat. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, let me say to 
members of the House this. I can live with a radio station 
inappropriately and improperly attributing statements to me, but 
when they mispronounce my name, I get a little bit offended, as 
I heard this morning. 
 
But having said that, Mr. Speaker, we have been working with 
Domtar since the merger to see if we can put together an 
agreement that will make the assets of the forest management 
agreement operational. We’re going to continue to do that. 
 
What I indicated to the public yesterday was the likelihood of 
the mill starting operations this fall were slim. And I did that 
because the business people in that area have a right to know. 
They need to make some business decisions. 
 
Mr. Speaker, having said that, we have an industry that has seen 
40 closures since Weyerhaeuser made its announcement. We’re 
going to continue to work with the industry to see if we can find 
a solution. We haven’t found one yet. Mr. Speaker, that is my 
role; that is what this government is going to do. And I want to 
say, Mr. Speaker, that the community is four-square behind 
those efforts. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosthern-Shellbrook. 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. Domtar 
shouldn’t have to clarify their position every time the minister 
opens his mouth. Domtar said they were surprised by the 
minister’s comments yesterday and that the company hasn’t 
made a decision yet. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have a minister that makes announcements 
without knowing the facts. We have a minister who insults 
potential investors from China. We have a minister who has 
paid over $417,000 of taxpayer money to Tom Waller for help 
with this portfolio. 
 
Mr. Speaker, here’s an idea. Why doesn’t the minister just stop 
making announcements until there’s something to announce, 
and then get the facts straight? Will the minister just keep his 
mouth quiet? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for the 
Forestry Secretariat. 



May 10, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1581 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, the answer to that is 
simply no. The people of Prince Albert have the right, the 
people of Big River have the right to know what’s happening 
with respect to the discussions that we’ve been taking place 
with Domtar. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Domtar had information given by this 
government. They saw the press release Friday. They had the 
press release Friday. Mr. Speaker, they knew what my 
comments were going to be. They knew I was going to clarify 
the process that had taken place. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, I will never apologize for informing the 
Prince Albert people and the Big River people of the work 
that’s been going on by the forest secretariat, by Mr. Waller, 
and by myself, Mr. Speaker. We have done everything in our 
power to move this file forward. And I want to tell members on 
that side we’re going to continue to do that. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosthern-Shellbrook. 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well I know 
why this minister won’t apologize. Look what happened with 
SPUDCO [Saskatchewan Potato Utility Development 
Company]. This minister has a track record that everybody in 
the province knows. 
 
The NDP government created a completely new department to 
deal with the P.A. mill. The NDP government has paid Tom 
Waller probably close to half a million dollars by this point and 
Waller appears to be as misinformed about the details as the 
minister is. Yet after all the minister’s bungling of this issue, 
yesterday he said he didn’t see this closure as a failure. He sees 
it as a success. 
 
Mr. Speaker, after all the misinformation and mishandling of 
this issue, how can the minister stand and say that this is a 
success? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for the 
Forestry Secretariat. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I read with some 
interest that member’s press release yesterday and in it he 
quotes a Calgary consultant from, a Calgary consultant on the 
forest sector. And I want to say, Mr. Speaker, this is the 
credibility they have. This guy’s office is in a crescent. When 
he was charged as to where he was going to get the money from 
to open this mill before Christmas two years ago, he couldn’t 
find it. Mr. Speaker, when Weyerhaeuser challenged him, he 
couldn’t find the money. We didn’t know where the Asian 
company came from. We didn’t know that this guy had four 
companies that weren’t registered all over North America. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that’s their credibility. They come in here wanting 
us to cut a deal with this backroom consultant from Calgary. 
And I say, Mr. Speaker, we’re going to work with legitimate 
companies. We’re going to work with the industry. And we’re 
going to be successful. This is not over. We’re only halfway 
through. 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 

Child Protection Issues 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
when I asked for an audit of organizations caring for children in 
Saskatchewan, the Minister of Community Resources accused 
me of a witch hunt. The minister yesterday, and I quote, said 
that he didn’t know of other concerns at other facilities. 
 
However, now the Children’s Advocate has spoken. Mr. 
Bernstein says that problems with the children’s welfare system 
extend well beyond the issues raised this week with Four 
Directions, and they go well beyond the issues of Oyate. Mr. 
Bernstein said he’s expressed concerns about the areas of 
dysfunction; he’s expressed concerns about the lack of 
vigilance and areas of deficiencies. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Children’s Advocate is doing his job. Why 
isn’t the minister protecting the children under his care? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister for 
Community Services. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, I see a disturbing pattern 
emerging from the Saskatchewan Party and the critic opposite, 
Mr. Speaker. When it comes to the health care field, what are 
they asking for? More auditors, Mr. Speaker. Not more doctors 
and more nurses — more auditors. 
 
When it comes to Indian Child and Family Services, what are 
they asking for? Not more workers, not collaboration with the 
federal government, not working hand in hand with the FSIN 
[Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations], not working hand 
in hand with the agencies that we’re speaking of, not working 
closely with the Children’s Advocate, Mr. Speaker. What do 
they want? They want more auditors, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And now I’ll point out I’d much rather have more child care 
workers, more involvement from the federal government, more 
involvement from the Children’s Advocate, and of course more 
resources to finally afford the First Nations people of 
Saskatchewan adequate facilities, adequate trained staff, and 
certainly a plan to help First Nations children all across the 
province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — A pretty simple answer, Mr. Speaker. If he 
was doing his job, we wouldn’t have to ask any of these 
questions. When difficulties at the Oyate Safe House came to 
light, the minister asked if there were any other agencies 
experiencing difficulties. This was while he was dealing with a 
serious problem at the Four Directions home. 
 
The only reason he shut down the Four Directions was that the 
Children’s Advocate was threatening to conduct his own 



1582 Saskatchewan Hansard May 10, 2007 

investigation and make it public. Mr. Speaker, this minister 
doesn’t seem to know what’s going on in his own department, 
and worst of all he doesn’t seem to care. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why is this minister more interested in covering 
up and trying to save his personal reputation than finding out 
whether his department is protecting children under his care? 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. I would ask members in their 
questioning and in their responses to deal with the issues and 
stick with the issues and leave personalities out of the issue. 
 
The Chair recognizes the member for . . . Order. Order please. 
Order please. The Chair recognizes the minister for Community 
Services. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
And that’s exactly why that member has no credibility amongst 
the First Nations people and amongst many, Mr. Speaker, 
amongst many agencies that are out there. One of the purpose I 
think it’s really important that people ought to know is that 
there are many CBO organizations, community-based 
organizations, that do wonderful work, wonderful work. And 
many of the First Nations CBOs also do wonderful work, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
And every single problem area that that member identified, 
every single area, our department knew of some of the 
problems. And our department was actively working to solve 
some of those problems, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And yes, the Children’s Advocate certainly has his work to do. 
And I’ve stated many, many times we respect his work, and 
we’ll continue working alongside the Children’s Advocate and 
the First Nations people to find solutions, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Again all that is important for them is the Saskatchewan Party 
politics, not the Saskatchewan people, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — It’s interesting, Mr. Speaker. The minister 
continues to acknowledge he knew something about it, but it’s 
evident he did nothing about it. The Children’s Advocate is 
very clear. He says: 
 

. . . there are “areas of dysfunction” with the provision of 
residential care for children. 
[He said] . . . the problem is more pervasive than Oyate 
and Four Directions.” 

 
Any sane person would be seriously concerned about comments 
like this. Anyone who cared about the fate of children in their 
care would want to do something about it. But not this minister. 
All we get from this minister is arrogance and contempt. 
 
Mr. Speaker, will this minister do the right thing? Will the 
minister commit today to conducting a full investigation? And 
is he willing to do his job? Will he at least get out of the way so 
somebody else can do it? 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order please. Once again, I had asked 
the member to be careful with his wording, not to cast 
aspersions on the personality of a specific person, particularly a 
member in the House. I’d ask him to now stand and withdraw 
the offensive statement. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — I withdraw that statement. 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. The Chair recognizes the 
minister for the Community Services. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Again I’ll point out that one of the problems that we have is 
certainly trying to make sure I reach out to people and engage 
as many of these CBOs and First Nations CBOs as well to try 
and get them together to make sure we find some lasting and 
permanent solutions. We’re able to work our way towards a 
very good model that all the rest of the country can follow, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
So I’ll point out that I’d much rather spend my time there and 
the resources and my staff’s time to work on solutions, Mr. 
Speaker, as opposed to hiring a bunch of auditors to go on a 
witch hunt, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I don’t personally 
consider the Children’s Advocate as an auditor. I pursue him as 
doing the job that he’s so elected to do. 
 
In his report last September, the Children’s Advocate said the 
Oyate Safe House was putting lives at risk by failing to 
adequately deal with the problems. Now the minister’s own 
report talks about safety concerns at Four Directions, problems 
with programming, problems with physical restraints. The First 
Nations child and safety agencies that the minister likes to talk 
about so much, they were dissatisfied with their working 
relationship with Four Directions and have pulled their children 
out. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this minister allowed dangerous situations to 
continue and he doesn’t even seem to care or acknowledge the 
seriousness of what’s going on. Mr. Speaker, why is this 
minister showing a lack of interest in what his department is 
doing and what the Children’s Advocate is saying? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[10:30] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister of 
Community Services. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, let me again point out to 
the people of Saskatchewan, that’s why that member and that 
party have no credibility on this issue. All they’re doing is 
playing politics. I did not refer to the Children’s Advocate as an 



May 10, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1583 

auditor, Mr. Speaker. And for that member to get up and make 
that particular statement, that is absolutely galling. 
 
And I’ll also point out that if he’s not able to provide some 
solution, if he’s not able to provide some direction from their 
party . . . Which they have no platform. They have no idea as to 
what they’re going to do, Mr. Speaker — hire a bunch of 
auditors, and oh by the way, we’re going to cut $50 million 
from this budget. So, Mr. Speaker, how is hiring auditors and 
cutting $50 million from the social services budget and really 
playing politics with the First Nations people, that’s going to 
cost the people of Saskatchewan much progress, Mr. Speaker. 
 
We are going to keep a level head. We’re going to engage as 
many people as we can to help find solutions and that’s exactly 
what leadership’s all about, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Mr. Speaker, the best solution I could give 
would be that the Premier would relieve that minister of his 
responsibilities. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Merriman: — And I’ll certainly be prepared to stand on 
my personal record of dealing with Aboriginal children in this 
province at any . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order. Order. Chair recognizes 
the member for — order, please — Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I’d certainly 
be prepared to stand on my personal record of dealing with 
Aboriginal children in this province on any day of the week. 
 
Mr. Speaker, due to safety concerns, someone’s going to die 
because of this minister’s carelessness. Lives will be damaged 
forever because of the minister’s complete . . . [inaudible] . . . in 
what’s going on. Mr. Speaker, kids came out of Four Directions 
worse off than they went in — with criminal records. That’s not 
how the system’s supposed to work. 
 
We have a moral and a legal obligation to help these children in 
need. That’s what the people of Saskatchewan want to see. 
They don’t want to see these children being further harmed. Mr. 
Speaker, when is this minister going to start doing his job? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Community Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
What I’ll point out is that I instruct my staff on a continual basis 
that they must respect the role of the Provincial Auditor. They 
must respect the role of the Children’s Advocate. They must 
respect the role of First Nations people, and yes, we must 
engage the federal government. There are many partners, Mr. 
Speaker, in finding some of the solutions that we ought to find 

in Saskatchewan and finally find a lasting resolution to some of 
the problems plaguing Indian Child and Family Services 
agencies throughout the province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I will point out that as a parent that has accepted the 
responsibility for all children, on- or off-reserve, that it is very 
important that any minister realize that in order to be a good 
parent that you look for as many partners to share in that 
responsibility, Mr. Speaker. And that’s exactly what this 
government is doing, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 

Investigation into Budget Leak 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. A few weeks 
ago the NDP were desperate to change the subject from the 
Murdoch Carriere scandal, so somebody leaked the budget. The 
Finance minister mustered up all the mock outrage he could 
find and promised an investigation. Now that investigation is 
done and it turns out to be a complete waste of time and 
taxpayers’ money. 
 
The investigator didn’t talk to any of the prime suspects. He 
didn’t talk to the minister. He didn’t talk to the NDP MLAs 
[Member of Legislative Assembly]. He didn’t talk to the 
minister’s political staff. He didn’t talk to the Premier’s staff. 
He didn’t talk to anybody that would have been trying to 
change the subject from the Murdoch Carriere scandal, and yet 
the Premier sits there and natters about the soap opera. The soap 
opera is his government. 
 
Mr. Speaker, who did this phony-baloney investigation, and 
will the minister table the investigator’s report? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
can tell you that the issues that the member has outlined are the 
reasons that this report is not yet complete, and we have said, 
go back and finish the report; go and finish the investigation 
and let us get some answers to this. 
 
But it is interesting that the only way I can get a question about 
the budget is to have a question about the budget leak. Do they 
want to stand and ask about the drug plan? No. Do they want to 
stand and talk about the graduate tax credit? No. Do they want 
to talk about the increased spending in health care? No. 
 
There’s nothing that that opposition wants to talk about in terms 
of policy because they’ve got no alternative. And that is exactly 
what the game plan is for that Sask Party between now and the 
provincial election. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 



1584 Saskatchewan Hansard May 10, 2007 

Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
The minister admits that the investigation was a complete sham, 
yet it was turned in to the Premier’s deputy minister, Mr. 
Speaker. And whose fault is that? Apparently the investigator 
didn’t get any directions. He didn’t get any sort of terms of 
reference, and obviously seems to be unable to be 
self-motivated. 
 
It’s pretty clear the NDP don’t really want to find out who the 
source of the leak is because the leak was their own idea, Mr. 
Speaker. Will the minister table the terms of reference the 
investigator received, if he received any terms of reference, and 
will he table this so-called investigation report? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — I have said very clearly, Mr. Speaker, 
that the investigation quite clearly is not yet complete, because 
what it appears happened is that the investigator treated this as 
if it was a normal review of a leak of a document within a 
department. And that is not in fact the way that we should be 
dealing with a potential budget leak. 
 
Now in this case no one got an undue access to information. But 
I will tell you this. I want to know who leaked that budget. And 
I said to the deputy minister and to the Premier that we need 
that investigation completed. 
 
Now what is it that members of the opposition want to talk 
about? They want to talk about the leak and the investigation. 
Why don’t we in the last five and a half minutes talk about what 
was contained in that budget? Why don’t we talk about why it 
is that those members voted against the drug plan? Why don’t 
we talk about why those members voted against the graduate 
tax credit? Why don’t we talk about why they voted against the 
budget that increased health care spending and hospital 
spending and spending on highways and spending in so many 
areas of social policy? Why not talk about that? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well by the 
minister’s own admission this investigation was not complete 
and yet the report’s been turned in to the Premier’s deputy 
minister. This so-called investigation was a fraud from the start, 
Mr. Speaker. It’s so bad that the minister is now asking for a 
mulligan. He wants to be able to go back and do it all over 
again. How much is that going to cost? Mr. Speaker, how much 
did the first phony-baloney investigation cost and how much is 
the next phony-baloney investigation going to cost? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Well I half expect the member 
opposite to soon start providing advice on how the investigators 
should go at it. I can only imagine. Can we borrow the secret 

hidden camera? That would help cut down on costs, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — We’re always happy to get advice 
from the opposition on how to investigate this. Let’s let these 
officials conduct their investigation, conclude their 
investigation. If I felt the investigation was complete, I would 
have released it. It is not. They need to go back. They need to 
do their work. And why don’t we go back and do some work in 
this Assembly debating what the real issues are? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, I’m not sure that they need a hidden camera. They just 
perhaps need to set up a camera in the minister’s office. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, who did this first 
investigation, Mr. Speaker? Who did this first . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Order. Member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
who did this first phony-baloney investigation? Was it the 
former chief of staff for the NDP caucus? Who’s going to do 
the do-over investigation? Is it the former chief of staff for the 
NDP caucus? He has experience and he’s available now, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Will the minister table the terms of references for both of the 
investigations, and who did and is doing the next investigation, 
Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Mr. Speaker, the investigation is being 
undertaken by the investigative unit at Property Management 
corporation. It’s their responsibility to do it. 
 
The terms of reference are simple. Do what it takes to find out 
the circumstances around the leak of the budget. That was it. It 
was a very simple task. This is a process that has been used and 
when we have an answer, we will be in a position to provide it. 
 
But I do welcome this debate in the remaining two minutes — 
since we are talking about the budget — as another opportunity 
for us to debate what the differences are between these two 
parties. Because there are significant differences. We believe in 
a universal drug plan for seniors. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — We believe in a graduate tax credit for 
young people. We believe in a highways program that dedicates 



May 10, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1585 

all the on-road gas tax to that and more to rebuilding our 
highway system. 
 
What is it that members of the opposition believe? We just 
don’t know. And that’s exactly how they’ll keep it until the 
election. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, if the investigator has the 
ability to do what it takes and the task is simple, why does the 
government have to go back and do this all over again? I’ll tell 
you, Mr. Speaker, why. 
 
Every time there’s problem in this NDP government, they look 
the other way. When there was fraud going on in the NDP 
caucus, the NDP looked the other way. When Murdoch Carriere 
was harassing women, they looked the other way. When the 
safety of children are threatened in group homes throughout the 
province, they look the other way; the minister looked the other 
way. 
 
And now the Finance minister promises to find out who leaked 
the budget. He doesn’t really want to find out, so he gets a 
phony-baloney investigation done so he can look the other way. 
But, Mr. Speaker, he needs to be careful when he shaves in the 
mornings. 
 
 Mr. Speaker, when is the NDP going to stop pretending to take 
responsibility and actually start to take responsibility for their 
mismanagement and incompetence? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Well this is the most bizarre assertion, 
that we are somehow attempting to look the other way, when I 
have just said to the investigators, keep looking; keep looking 
— that the report that was provided is not acceptable — keep 
looking. 
 
And I’ll tell you this, Mr. Speaker. We too will keep looking for 
what it is that that party promises to Saskatchewan people. We 
will keep looking to see whether they have a true alternative to 
the agenda that we have presented that is helping this province 
create thousands of new jobs; is welcoming young people back 
to this province; is protecting the quality of health care for our 
seniors. We will see whether there is anything in an alternative 
from that party or if it is simply a desire to be a government. 
That, Mr. Speaker, is what we will see. That will be the 
decision. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORDERS OF THE DAY 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Government House 
Leader. 
 

Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, with a wish to all hon. 
members that we’ll have some quality time to spend with our 
mothers this weekend, and also in order to accommodate the 
good work of the Standing Committees on Human Services as 
well as Intergovernmental Affairs and Infrastructure, I move 
this House do now adjourn. 
 
The Speaker: — Before I entertain that motion, I just want to 
advise members that I’m going to ask Pages to distribute a little 
message from the Speaker. So they can pick it up before they 
leave. You can do that right away. 
 
It has been moved by the Government House Leader that — 
perhaps you could stand at the doors — that this House do now 
adjourn. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. This House stands 
adjourned until Monday at 1:30 p.m. 
 
[The Assembly adjourned at 10:46.]
