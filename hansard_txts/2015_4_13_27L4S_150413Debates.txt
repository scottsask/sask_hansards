 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 6895 
 April 13, 2015 
 
[The Assembly met at 13:30.] 
 
[Prayers] 
 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thanks very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to 
present a petition calling for support for better schools here in 
Saskatchewan. We know that far too many of our classrooms 
are overcrowded and under resourced and that the Sask Party 
government eliminated hundreds of educational assistant 
positions, that students often don’t get the one-on-one attention 
they need and that the condition of our schools are rundown, 
unsafe, were uninspected, and this government has refused to 
release information on the $1.5 billion of known repairs that are 
needed in our schools, and the government’s plan is to rent 
schools from private corporations which is expensive and 
reckless. 
 
None of this is acceptable, Mr. Speaker, given the record 
revenues this government has had over the last eight years. I’d 
like to read the prayer now: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully request 
that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan call on this 
government to immediately stop ignoring schools and start 
prioritizing students by capping classroom sizes, increasing 
support for our students, and developing a transparent plan 
to build and repair our schools. 

 
Mr. Speaker, I do so present. Thank you very much. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise once 
again to present petitions to call this government to act to 
ensure safety on Dewdney Avenue. Of course this government 
acted to create unsafe conditions on Dewdney Avenue, 
inundating it with heavy-haul truck traffic, not planning a safe 
route for that traffic. And the prayer reads as follows: 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 
honourable Legislative Assembly call on the provincial 
government to immediately take action as it relates to the 
unacceptable danger, disturbance, and infrastructure 
damage caused by the heavy-haul truck traffic on Dewdney 
Avenue west of the city centre, to ensure the safety and 
well-being of communities, families, residents, and users; 
and that those actions and plans should include rerouting 
the heavy-haul truck traffic, receive provincial funding, 
and be developed through consultation with the city of 
Regina, communities, and residents. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
These petitions today are signed by concerned residents from 
Regina. I so submit. 
 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Opposition Whip. 
 
Mr. Vermette: — I rise today to present a petition. 
Homelessness is a major problem in La Ronge and other parts 
of the North, and getting worse. Shelter is a basic need for 
everyone, but under this government it’s getting harder and 
harder for people to find adequate housing, especially families, 
seniors, women, and children who face abusive situations. The 
problem is getting worse because of the rising level of poverty 
and skyrocketing home ownership cost. The prayer reads: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully request 
that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan take the 
following action: to cause the Saskatchewan government to 
build a homeless shelter in the Lac la Ronge area to meet 
the needs of addressing homelessness in the Lac la Ronge 
area. 

 
It is signed by many good people of northern Saskatchewan. I 
so present. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased today 
to rise again to present a petition in support of safe staffing 
levels in long-term care. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the petitioners point out that many aspects of 
long-term care are deteriorating under this government. The 
petitioners point out that the Government of Saskatchewan 
actually recognize the need . . . they need to recognize the need 
for safe staffing levels to provide hands-on care to residents. 
They point out that the government removed the regulations 
requiring a minimum standard of care for seniors, which has 
resulted in neglect. And the petitioners talk about how chronic 
understaffing in long-term care facilities results in unacceptable 
conditions, including unanswered calls for help, infrequent 
bathing, and a rise in physical violence amongst residents. I’d 
like to read the prayer: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully 
request that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan 
take the following action: to cause the government to 
commit to the creation of safe staffing levels for all valued 
members of the health care team and to re-introduce actual 
numbers of staff to match the level of care needs and the 
number of residents under their care in long-term care 
facilities. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 
 

Mr. Speaker, this petition is signed from residents of Saskatoon. 
I so submit. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to present a 
petition in support of retaining Yarrow Youth Farm. The people 
who have signed this petition wish the following: that 
Saskatchewan currently offers a variety of facility options to 



6896 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2015 

house youth offenders according to an assessed level of risk to 
their communities, and that Saskatoon had Yarrow Youth Farm, 
a facility for low-risk teens who benefit from an open-custody 
home with a caring, supportive environment and programs to 
help the residents live more productive lives. 
 
The government is planning to close Yarrow Youth Farm and 
create an open-custody wing in Kilburn Hall, and the provincial 
Advocate for Children and Youth declares he cannot endorse 
such a rationalization as low-risk teens could be influenced and 
pressured by close proximity to high-risk youth. 
 
The prayer reads as follows: 
 

They respectfully request that the Legislative Assembly of 
Saskatchewan take the following action: to cause the 
government to keep Yarrow Youth Farm open to ensure a 
caring home environment for youth who have committed 
minor offences, and provide support to help these young 
people redirect their lives by setting more positive goals. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
Mr. Speaker, this is signed by people from Saskatoon. I so 
submit. 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 
Qu’Appelle Valley. 
 

2015 Paragon Awards 
 
Ms. Ross: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Last week I 
had the opportunity to bring greetings on behalf of the 
government at the 2015 Paragon Awards hosted by Regina and 
District Chamber of Commerce. This award ceremony 
celebrates the hard work and success of local businesses. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to announce that Harvard 
Development took home the prestigious Business of the Year 
award. The Young Entrepreneur award went to Tara Bokitch of 
Solitude & Soul Home Decor & Gift Studio. Mr. Speaker, St. 
John Ambulance, Fries Tallman Lumber, CanMar Grain 
Products, Harley-Davidson, the Regina Food Bank, Potash 
Corp, ManpowerGroup, Delta Hotels, Cobs Bread, Dr. Shirif, 
and Dr. Henni also took home awards. 
 
Mr. Speaker, our government is committed to encouraging job 
creation and capital investment. That is why the 2015-2016 
budget included new growth tax incentives. The new 
manufacturing and processing exporter tax incentive will 
provide tax credits to eligible exporting corporations that 
increase their number of full-time employees. The incentive 
will also apply to corporations involved in the commercial 
development of new products, including interactive digital 
media and creative industry products. 
 
As we know, Saskatchewan is a great place to own and start a 
new business. Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in 
congratulating the winners of the prestigious Paragon Awards 
and commend the Regina and District Chamber of Commerce 
for hosting such a fabulous event. Thank you very much, Mr. 

Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 

Tribute to Saskatoon Music Community Leader 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, it’s with great sadness that I rise 
in the Assembly today to recognize the passing of an important 
leader in Saskatchewan’s music community, Dr. David Kaplan. 
David Kaplan was well known in Saskatoon and across the 
province as a composer, a music educator, an orchestral 
conductor, a band director, and he died last Monday at the age 
of 91. 
 
David Kaplan moved to Saskatoon to teach music at the 
University of Saskatchewan in 1960 and only planned on 
staying for a few years. But like so many others who have come 
to Saskatchewan, he never left. He spent nearly 40 years at the 
Department of Music where he composed a number of works 
for band and orchestra, and founded the University of 
Saskatchewan Wind Orchestra, an ensemble that continues to 
perform across our province and around the world. 
 
David Kaplan was also a key leader at the Saskatoon Symphony 
Orchestra. He served for many years as the orchestra’s music 
director and continued to give engaging pre-concert talks well 
into his senior years. 
 
He was also committed to helping our province live up to its 
motto, “from many peoples, strength,” through his music and 
volunteerism. His compositions brought together many different 
musical styles, and he was a founding member of Saskatoon’s 
Festival of Faith. 
 
A short list of his awards and accomplishments includes the 
Order of Canada, the Saskatchewan Order of Merit, the Queen’s 
Diamond Jubilee Medal, and the Saskatchewan Centennial 
Medal. It is hard to imagine how anyone could have been more 
deserving. 
 
And so I ask all members of the Assembly to join me in 
recognizing the remarkable life and contributions of Dr. David 
Kaplan, a man whose music and life truly embodied the 
Saskatchewan spirit. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Melfort. 
 

Melfort Team Wins Provincial Basketball Championship 
 
Mr. Phillips: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it 
seems like just three short months ago I was standing in this 
House to bring attention to the Melfort Comets football team 
who won the provincial 4A championship. Well, Mr. Speaker, a 
couple of weeks ago, the Melfort Comets basketball team won 
the 4A provincial championships at Hoopla 2015. 
 
The first game for Melfort at Hoopla was against Moose Jaw 
Central, and the Comets won that game 71 to 47. Comets’ high 
scorers were Alex Linnell with 20 points and Troy Taylor with 
13. The next game was a gold medal game against Meadow 
Lake. Melfort won that 73 to 65, and again Alex and Troy led 
the way with 21 and 20 points respectively. It was an exciting 



April 13, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6897 

game from start to finish, coming right down to the final buzzer. 
In the last 40 seconds, Alex hit six critical free throws to seal 
the game for Melfort, six in a row. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the memories of winning a provincial title is 
something that will last for a lifetime with these students. But 
for some of these students, to win two in the same school year 
is absolutely incredible. I would ask that all members join me in 
congratulating the Comets on their second title. And, Mr. 
Speaker, it is only April. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 

Ehrlo Outdoor Hockey League 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, although the ice is 
retreating from many ponds and lakes across Saskatchewan, I’m 
pleased to announce that the great Canadian tradition of outdoor 
hockey was very much alive and well here in Regina this past 
season. The outdoor hockey league, also known as the OHL, is 
a very successful program that has been run by Ranch Ehrlo’s 
sport venture for more than 20 years. This program ensures that 
kids from all walks of life have the opportunity to take part in 
our country’s national pastime. 
 
I volunteered for many years as a coach in the OHL, and I have 
so many great memories of young people growing and building 
relationships through hockey. This year was no different. More 
than 300 young people from all across our city take part in this 
program in nine different rinks each and every year. 
 
But like all things in our community, the OHL relies on the hard 
work and dedication of donors and volunteers. I’d like to 
specifically thank Amanda McConnell, Kelly Buchinski from 
Ehrlo sport venture; two of the Rosemont coaches, Megan 
Johnson and Cole Kowalyk; two of the Rosemont shack 
keepers, Dennis and Judy Zawryucka; and the generous 
supporters, sponsors including RBC [Royal Bank of Canada], 
The Co-operators, the Access children’s fund, the town of Pilot 
Butte, and Weston Ltd. 
 
I ask all members of this Assembly to join with me to recognize 
and to thank all of those that make the outdoor hockey league 
such a meaningful and successful program. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 

 
Labour Force Survey Shows Saskatchewan’s Growth 

 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Saskatchewan is 
growing, and I’m happy to report that more and more citizens 
are finding opportunity here. The Labour Force Survey report 
was released last week and Saskatchewan continues to remain 
strong. Saskatchewan again has the lowest unemployment rate 
among all provinces at 4.4. This marks 18 consecutive months 
of lowest unemployment, well below the national average of 
6.8. In fact, Mr. Speaker, we had beaten our old record from last 
month with a further decrease of 0.6 per cent. 
 
There is an all-time high of citizens 15 years of age or older, 
some 859,000 individuals living in Saskatchewan. This means 

more people working, contributing to their own families’ 
success. Labour Force statistics also reported an increase of 400 
jobs for Aboriginal employment. Youth unemployment rates 
also saw a decrease, is now sitting at 8.6, well below the 
national average of 13 per cent. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we realize that Saskatchewan is seeing some 
recent economic challenges, but these numbers truly attest to 
the diversity of our economy and the people who work hard to 
keep their own families strong and secure. With a robust 
economy, Stats Canada predicts not only that Saskatchewan 
will continue to grow in 2015, but our province’s current and 
future job prospects remain robust. We truly do have what it 
takes to keep Saskatchewan strong. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
[13:45] 
 

Honorary Ambassador for Autism Speaks Canada Event  
 

Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, recently 
Jayden Johnson, the son of Lee and Kerrie Johnson of Margo, 
was named national honorary ambassador for Walk Now for 
Autism Speaks Canada. As the most important funding event 
for Autism Speaks Canada, the Walk Now for Autism will 
support scientific research, services, advocacy, and awareness. 
Mr. Speaker, Jayden will be the ambassador for over 100 walks 
that’ll take place this summer right throughout Canada. 
 
Jayden, now five and a half years old, did not speak until he 
was three years old. Since his diagnosis, he has improved 
immensely in the areas of communication, socialization, and 
behaviour. Jayden enjoys swimming, fishing, and riding along 
in the tractor and the combine on his family farm, and he started 
to play hockey this year. Team Jayden, including his parents 
and his brother Gavin, will walk in Saskatoon on June the 21st. 
As well the family is planning a fundraiser in Wadena on April 
the 22nd. 
 
Mr. Speaker, an avid blogger and a parent of an autistic child 
writes that autism means, and I quote, “I accept my child 
wholly. I celebrate his differences and his quirkiness. I do not 
think he needs fixing.” But, Mr. Speaker, that doesn’t mean that 
each of these children and their families doesn’t need our help. 
Autism now affects 1 in every 68 children, a 78 per cent 
increase from six years ago. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask this Assembly to join with me in 
congratulating Jayden for being chosen the honorary 
ambassador for this year’s Walk Now for Autism Speaks 
Canada. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 

Project Heroes Exhibit  
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to our country’s fallen heroes. April the 
9th marked the 98th anniversary of the beginning of one of the 
greatest military victories in our country’s history. The Battle of 
Vimy Ridge lasted three days, but on April the 12th it was 



6898 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2015 

Canadian troops who held the high ground. They accomplished 
what others could not do. 
 
From Europe to Afghanistan, almost a century later, Canadians 
have led the fight for freedom. Though these battles are almost 
a century apart, the stories of heroism and sacrifice from both 
conflicts touch us deeply. 
 
A stirring tribute to our fallen soldiers in Afghanistan, the 
Project Heroes exhibit was launched at Government House last 
Thursday on Vimy Ridge Day. Mr. Speaker, working from 
family photos, the three artists behind this ongoing tribute have 
completed oil paintings of 78 of the 158 Canadians killed in 
Afghanistan. They are accompanied by each soldier’s personal 
story. These moving portraits line the halls and corridors of 
Government House. Shoulder to shoulder, they stand on guard. 
In addition, a maple tree with yellow ribbons representing all 
Canadian soldiers who served in Afghanistan stands as a 
sentinel in the foyer. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is a tribute not to be missed. I encourage 
everyone to visit Government House where the exhibit runs 
until June 21st. We will remember them. Thank you. 
 

QUESTION PERIOD 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Provision of Hyperbaric Treatments 
 
Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Dr. David Amies sent 
me a letter late last week which says this government clearly 
doesn’t have its facts straight when it comes to the hyperbaric 
chamber in Moose Jaw. Dr. Amies is the expert on this. My 
question to the Premier, Mr. Speaker: will he agree to meet with 
Dr. David Amies so he can finally get his facts straight about 
the hyperbaric chamber in Moose Jaw? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, I’ll answer that question in 
the absence of the Premier on behalf of the Government of 
Saskatchewan. Mr. Speaker, I’ve had the opportunity to meet 
with Dr. David Amies in the past in my office here in Regina. 
He had the opportunity to talk about the service that has been 
provided. I would be happy to speak with Dr. Amies at any 
time, Mr. Speaker, as we look to how we’re going to provide 
the service into the future. But if Dr. Amies would like to meet 
with me, I’d be happy to, more than happy to meet with him 
again. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, this government shouldn’t simply 
meet with someone, they should listen to what the physician is 
raising, Mr. Speaker. And if they had been listening, you 
wouldn’t see the approach that this government has taken when 
it comes to the hyperbaric chamber in Moose Jaw. 
 
Dr. Amies is especially frustrated that this government claims 
that the hyperbaric chamber could simply be moved to a clinic. 
He talks about the need for a special conductive flooring, a 
controlled high-humidity atmosphere, the ability to pipe in large 

volumes of oxygen, and the need for an auxiliary high-pressure 
oxygen tank. He also talks about, Mr. Speaker, the physicians 
and the respiratory therapists at the Moose Jaw Hospital who 
have travelled to South Carolina for the specialized training in 
order to provide this hyperbaric treatment. My question, Mr. 
Speaker, is to the Premier. How can he possibly dispute these 
facts? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Again in the 
absence of the Premier, I’d be happy to take that question on 
behalf of the Government of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is information that we are certainly aware of 
in terms of what would be required in order to operate, whether 
this be in a in-patient acute care facility or whether it be in an 
outpatient facility like a clinic, Mr. Speaker, which happens in 
many parts of North America. In fact we contract some services 
for hyperbaric services out of an outpatient clinic in Alberta, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
So whether it’s an in-patient or whether it’s an outpatient, yes it 
does have some costs. We don’t dispute that. In fact that’s a 
part of the calculation and the analysis that we’re doing, Mr. 
Speaker. So again to the Leader of the Opposition, that is a part 
of the work that we are doing. We don’t discount that. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, they do discount it because 
they’re actually moving in the opposite direction. They’re 
taking this important service out of the hospital setting into a 
clinic potentially or not at all. That’s the plan right now. No 
plan whatsoever when it comes to the future of the hyperbaric 
chamber, and it’s causing confusion and concern among 
patients and residents in this province. 
 
According to Dr. Amies, there’s absolutely no alternative to 
hyperbaric treatment for acute cases like severe carbon 
monoxide poisoning. This is what he writes: 
 

Emergencies arrive at the ER, are assessed by one of the 
three doctors on call 24-7 for the HBO unit, and transferred 
there immediately. For carbon monoxide poisoning, three 
treatments are given within 24 hours and the subject then 
goes home. 

 
Dr. Amies says that 30 per cent of treatments in the hyperbaric 
chamber in Moose Jaw were in-patient treatments, and he says 
the remaining treatment for outpatients are best provided in the 
hospital setting. We know that the hyperbaric chamber saves 
money because it reduces the need for amputations, and it 
allows those with severe wounds to heal more quickly. 
 
My question, Mr. Speaker, is to the Premier. Is he listening to 
these arguments being made by Dr. Amies, and will he finally 
commit to save hospital-based hyperbaric treatment here in 
Saskatchewan? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 



April 13, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6899 

again on behalf of the Government of Saskatchewan in the 
absence of the Premier, I’ll take that question. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is information that certainly we are aware of, 
that the vast majority of treatment in the hyperbaric unit over 
the last 16 years has been of an outpatient nature, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, we certainly know the information in terms of the 
treatment, the type of treatment that’s provided by a hyperbaric 
unit, as well as the alternative treatment, Mr. Speaker, that can 
be provided. 
 
I am also aware, Mr. Speaker, that not every single case of 
somebody using the hyperbaric services in this province is 
treated in Moose Jaw, Mr. Speaker. Some people do go outside 
of the province for treatment. Mr. Speaker, that may be part of 
the solution going forward. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we are doing our analysis on whether or not this 
will be housed in an in-patient unit or whether or not we’ll look 
towards a clinic type of setting. Mr. Speaker, we know that 
there are a variety of different reasons, for radiation, for other 
reasons, Mr. Speaker, why somebody uses hyperbaric. That’s 
all going into the decision of how we’re going to provide 
hyperbaric services in the future. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, it’s absolutely bizarre and 
head-scratching why this government would insist on taking us 
backwards when it comes to the treatment that many patients 
need in the province. We have a properly functioning 
hyperbaric chamber in Moose Jaw where patients can receive 
the training, where the professionals are, where the 
infrastructure is there now and should have been planned for 
properly, Mr. Speaker. We know that 30 per cent of hyperbaric 
treatments in our province are in-patient treatments. Many 
require acute care for carbon monoxide poisoning. 
 
When 36 per cent of hyperbaric treatments in our province are 
for non-healing wounds, when 46 per cent of hyperbaric 
treatments in this province are for cancer patients — cancer 
patients who require treatment for the severe side effects of 
radiation — this government ought to recognize the tremendous 
value of hyperbaric treatment here in Saskatchewan, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
My question to the Premier: why does he dispute the facts 
presented by Dr. Amies? Or will he finally admit, finally admit 
that this treatment is incredibly valuable and it needs to be 
saved in a hospital setting? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As part of our 
analysis, we’re looking at all the uses of the hyperbaric services 
over the last 16 years, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in terms of the use of the hyperbaric services, the 
vast majority of that has been on an outpatient basis over the 
last 16 years, Mr. Speaker. I believe the numbers, I don’t have 
them in front of me, but I believe the numbers that the ministry 
and the region have presented over the last 16 years is over 90 
per cent of services have been on an outpatient basis, Mr. 

Speaker, whether that be for a healing of wounds, whether that 
be for follow-up after radiation treatment, Mr. Speaker, or other 
concerns. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is something we are looking at in terms of 
how we’re going to provide this. For the Leader of the 
Opposition to stand in his place and say that an in-patient 
setting is the only way to provide hyperbaric services in the 
province, is the only way that any other jurisdiction provides 
hyperbaric services, is just not correct, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, there are a variety of options that we’re looking at, and 
we’re doing our analysis now. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, they are reducing services for 
Saskatchewan patients. We have a physician, Mr. Speaker, in 
the province, Dr. Amies, who points out that 30 per cent of 
hyperbaric treatments in our province are in-patient treatments, 
many of whom require acute care for carbon monoxide 
poisoning. 
 
You know, Mr. Speaker, at the end of March the Premier stood 
and he said this: “Its presence in the new Moose Jaw Hospital is 
potentially [still] an option . . .” That was just at the end of 
March. The Health minister said they’re looking at possibly 
adding on and expanding to the still-under-construction Moose 
Jaw Hospital, Mr. Speaker. 
 
My question to the Premier: will he admit, will he admit that his 
government made a mistake, that it shrunk the Moose Jaw 
Hospital too much, that it was a mistake to leave out the 
hyperbaric chamber? And will he commit to fixing that mistake 
today? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, what I will commit to is 
that later this day, Mr. Speaker, again on behalf of, in the 
absence of the Premier on behalf of the government, what I will 
confirm today, Mr. Speaker, is that the new hospital in Moose 
Jaw is going to be opening later this year, Mr. Speaker. This 
government has committed to, that this government has 
invested, along with the foundation and local communities, Mr. 
Speaker, nearly $100 million to build that hospital. 
 
And what they’ve also committed to, and what we’ve 
committed to, Mr. Speaker, is providing the operational dollars 
for a new MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] to serve the 
people of southern Saskatchewan, the people of Moose Jaw, 
and the surrounding areas in the Five Hills Health Region. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we are looking at, in terms of how we’re going to 
provide that service going forward in the future, Mr. Speaker, 
continue to rely on out of province, which we have in the past, 
Mr. Speaker, whether or not there is an opportunity for 
in-patient or outpatient, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I can tell you that outpatients versus in-patients — 
this is the utilization of the chamber from 1997 to 2012, so yes, 
I am missing a few years at the end — but for the vast majority 
of that time, 94 per cent was on an outpatient basis, 6 per cent 
on an in-patient basis, Mr. Speaker. Those are the actual 



6900 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2015 

numbers, that utilization for that particular chamber. But we’re 
going to continue to work with the region to find how we’re 
going to provide services into the future. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, once again we see a track record 
from this government of just dismissing what people in the 
province are saying, like Dr. Amies coming forward, Mr. 
Speaker, with the actual facts, not this spin from the minister. 
 
At the end of March, Mr. Speaker, we know that the Premier 
stood in the Assembly and said that they are still looking at the 
option of having the hyperbaric chamber in the new Moose Jaw 
Hospital. The Health minister said that they are looking at 
adding on to the Moose Jaw Hospital, Mr. Speaker. 
 
My question to the Premier: does he stand by the remark that 
was made earlier? Does the Health minister stand by the 
remarks that he made earlier? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Again, Mr. Speaker, in the absence of 
the Premier, I’d be pleased to take that question on behalf of the 
Government of Saskatchewan.  
 
Mr. Speaker, we’re doing our analysis in terms of what it will 
cost on a capital basis, on an operational basis, to provide it in 
an in-patient unit, Mr. Speaker. We’re also doing our analysis in 
terms of on an outpatient basis, Mr. Speaker, in a clinic type of 
setting, what type of capital costs it would require to do the 
outfitting that would take place. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s important though that I put on the record that 
hyperbaric therapy is generally used as an adjunctive therapy to 
assist the primary medical treatment after emergency 
stabilization of a patient, Mr. Speaker. Hyperbaric oxygen 
therapy may be considered as a part of the secondary treatment 
after primary treatment takes place. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I think it’s also important to note, to put on the 
record, this is an important service, Mr. Speaker, but let’s put it 
in perspective. In 2009-2010, the number of patients that went 
through the hyperbaric services in Moose Jaw, 13; 2010-11, 13; 
’11-12, 20; ’12-13, 19, Mr. Speaker; and ’14-15 year-to-date, 
12 patients, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So it’s an important service, but for a very small number of 
people. Mr. Speaker, that’s why we decided to invest with the 
foundation in an MRI because that’s . . . we know where the 
most use will be made. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Usage of Foreign Workers and Relationship With Developer 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, does the Premier agree 
that temporary foreign workers should never displace 
Saskatchewan workers? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Immigration. 
 

Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Well, Mr. Speaker, we’ve said that we 
take an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to our labour 
market here in the province. Of course we would like to see 
Saskatchewan residents hired first for available jobs, Canadians 
as well. And if we need to go abroad, Mr. Speaker, then we 
definitely need to look at that. And that’s why we have been 
bringing in newcomers at a record pace here in the province, 
Mr. Speaker — 5,500 nominees this year, a record amount — 
far more than the NDP [New Democratic Party]. And we 
believe that that’s an important part of our province going 
forward. 
 
[14:00] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, the minister maybe didn’t 
hear the question for the Premier. The question was whether 
foreign temporary workers should ever displace Saskatchewan 
workers. Certainly on this side of the Assembly, we believe that 
should never be case, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Troy Jessop is here today. He was a painter with Deveraux 
Developments, but he has shared with us that he was displaced 
by temporary foreign workers and laid off. Does the Premier 
agree that this entirely inappropriate and unacceptable? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Immigration. 
 
Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 
the absence of the Premier, I’ll be taking that question. As I’ve 
said, we take an all-of-the-above approach when it comes to our 
labour market. That means that we want to see Canadians and 
Saskatchewan residents hired first for available job 
opportunities. And we’ve seen that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Just on Friday, we saw new job numbers released by Statistics 
Canada showing Saskatchewan having the lowest 
unemployment rate in the country by far: 4.4 per cent, Mr. 
Speaker, national average nearly 7 per cent. We saw as well 
record numbers of folks working here in the province, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
We do, like I said, want to see Canadians and Saskatchewan 
residents first in line for jobs, but we do know as well that our 
economy has been creating such a volume of opportunity here 
in the province that we need to look abroad as well for skilled 
labour particularly, Mr. Speaker. And we’ve done that through 
our nominee program: very, very successful, I think generally 
regarded as the most successful nominee program in the entire 
country, Mr. Speaker. We’re going to continue to do that. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, why is it so hard for that 
minister and government to say that Saskatchewan workers 
should never be displaced, full stop, period? Troy had his own 
painting company. He started working for Deveraux in January 
2014 as an employee. In May 2014, Deveraux hired three 
foreign or temporary foreign workers. 
 
Troy helped train those foreign workers and helped settle them 
here. And then on January 19th of this year, Deveraux laid off 



April 13, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6901 

Troy. And it laid off two other Saskatchewan workers, but 
Deveraux kept the temporary foreign workers employed. So 
three Saskatchewan workers lost their jobs and three temporary 
foreign workers are still working, Mr. Speaker. Does this 
Premier agree that this should not be happening at all, and will 
he actually commit to doing something about it? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Immigration. 
 
Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Thank you, thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. With regard to the temporary foreign worker program, 
we know in December 2013 the temporary foreign workers 
made up only about 2 per cent of our workforce here in the 
province. We also know, Mr. Speaker, of the immigrant 
nominee program, approximately 50 per cent of our nominees 
through the immigrant nominee program started out as 
temporary foreign workers. 
 
I would be very interested to know if the position of the official 
opposition is that the temporary foreign worker program should 
be shuttered. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, it’s pathetic that the 
minister won’t even come close to addressing the actual issue 
and the displaced Saskatchewan worker that’s in the Assembly 
here today. 
 
This is the same company that was handed a health region 
contract in Prince Albert. This is the same company that walked 
away from a low-income housing unit contract in Regina with 
this government’s blessing. In fact this government let them 
scrap the contract and keep the 48-unit housing project. The 
Social Services minister said, “I think our relationship with 
Deveraux warrants the fact that we don’t thump on them.” And 
we’ve heard from Troy that the Premier himself may have a 
pretty cozy relationship with Deveraux, as apparently the VP 
[vice-president] of Deveraux brags that the Premier has stayed 
with him at his condo, the VP’s condo, down in Mexico. 
 
Now the Premier knows about these facts, about Deveraux 
laying off Saskatchewan workers and keeping temporary 
foreign workers. Will this government actually do something, 
or will the Premier let his special relationship continue to cloud 
his judgment? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Immigration. 
 
Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Mr. Speaker, I think the member 
opposite, if he’s making a specific allegation with regard to the 
Premier, he needs to do it, put it on the floor right now. Make 
that allegation outside; let’s hear what it is. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, if you think that minister 
can get up and scare us away from doing our job and standing 
up for displaced Saskatchewan workers, that minister and that 
government has another think coming. We have a displaced 
worker that’s in this Assembly here. That worker has shared 
this other piece around the very special relationship that the 
Premier has, and time and time again this Premier and this 

government has showed that this very special relationship has 
clouded their judgment. 
 
So today, not to the minister: will the Premier explain his 
special relationship with Deveraux and why his government has 
given this company special treatment, and really finally do the 
right thing and stand up to this company? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Immigration. 
 
Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Well, Mr. Speaker, in the very obvious 
absence of the Premier, I will be taking that question. 
 
Again, Mr. Speaker, we see some very, very serious 
insinuations being made by the Deputy Leader of the 
Opposition about knowledge that the Premier may or may not 
have had, refusing, refusing on the floor of the Assembly — 
protected by privilege, mind you — to put on the floor what 
those actual allegations are. I think he has an obligation, Mr. 
Speaker, that if he has specific allegations, he puts them on the 
floor of the Assembly. He knows he’s protected by privilege in 
here. He’s not out there. I challenge him to do it out there as 
well. He should do that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
He’s asking economic questions. Let’s talk about the economy, 
Mr. Speaker. Let’s talk about job creation here in this province: 
4.4 per cent, the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country 
by far, Mr. Speaker, 18 consecutive months of the lowest 
unemployment rate in the entire country. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the 
allegations that have been brought forward of displaced 
Saskatchewan workers, and a cozy relationship with the 
Premier, Mr. Speaker, you bet we’ll go out into the rotunda and 
we’ll stand up for Saskatchewan workers. 
 
This minister’s all over the map, Mr. Speaker, but hasn’t 
answered a single question here today, hasn’t stood up for 
Saskatchewan workers saying it’s wrong to displace them, Mr. 
Speaker, and hasn’t spoken to this very special relationship that 
this Premier and this government has with this developer, the 
same developer that they gave a housing project to, Mr. 
Speaker. Why won’t this minister, why won’t this government, 
why won’t this Premier stand up for Saskatchewan workers? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Immigration. 
 
Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Again, Mr. Speaker, in the very 
obvious absence of the Premier, I’ll be taking that question on 
behalf of the government. 
 
You know, again the member is alluding to or making certain 
allegations against the Premier, about the Premier, about some 
sort of special relationship that the Premier apparently has. He 
refuses though to put any semblance of detail onto the floor 
about what that supposed special relationship is, Mr. Speaker. 
 
In terms of the economy, in terms of the economy, which they 
guffaw about this over there, Mr. Speaker, they take every 
chance they can to talk down the economy over there. We know 
that, Mr. Speaker. We had some spectacular job numbers on 



6902 Saskatchewan Hansard April 13, 2015 

Friday, showing Saskatchewan leading Canada in a whole 
bunch of categories with regard to our labour market, Mr. 
Speaker: 18 consecutive months, the lowest unemployment rate 
in Canada; the lowest youth unemployment rate in Canada by 
far, by nearly 5 per cent, Mr. Speaker.  
 
We don’t hear anything about that from them. They have 
nothing to say about the economy other than Buy Local Day, 
which you know, that’s fine. We’ll be happy to do that, Mr. 
Speaker. That’s the only economic policy they have over there. 
We have a serious plan for our economy, Mr. Speaker, laid out 
in the plan for growth, which we’ve been delivering on. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 

Conditions at Health Facility 
 
Ms. Chartier: — After a vulnerable senior with dementia ate 
detergent pods and died late last month, the CEO [chief 
executive officer] of Providence Place facility in Moose Jaw 
said there was no sign of any unresolved issues from residents 
or staff. The CEO and a health region vice-president said there 
were no issues with short-staffing. And the Health minister said, 
“I take the region at face value.” 
 
But then we learned that the union representing front-line 
workers wrote to that particular care facility and the health 
region back in January, raising major concerns about 
short-staffing putting residents at risk. Does the Health minister 
still stand by the facility CEO and the health region 
vice-president, or will he admit now that the government knew 
about major problems at Providence Place but ignored them? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
what I can tell the House and what I can tell the public is 
Providence Place in Moose Jaw, the number of beds at that 
facility haven’t changed under this government. Same number 
of beds as it was under the NDP as it is today, Mr. Speaker. 
What has changed though is that funding to that facility is up 46 
per cent in the last seven years and staffing levels are actually 
up 9 per cent, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So when the member opposite presents petitions asking the 
government to re-establish, Mr. Speaker, the staffing numbers 
that they had in the past, Mr. Speaker, we don’t want to do that, 
because what that would mean, Mr. Speaker, it would have to 
mean that we’d have to actually reduce staff in long-term care 
all across this province. We’d have to reduce nearly 800 
full-time positions to get back to the staffing levels of the NDP. 
 
What I’m also not going to do, Mr. Speaker, in any of these 
cases, is I’m not going to jump to conclusions as did the 
members opposite when they issued a news release about a 
serious situation, Mr. Speaker, that was riddled with mistakes, 
inaccuracies, speaking about an individual, Mr. Speaker, in 
circumstances that actually weren’t factual to that individual. 
I’m not going to do like the NDP and jump to those 
conclusions. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — The letter sent by SEIU [Service Employees 
International Union] West to the care facility and the health 
region talked about having “. . . cause to be alarmed that 
chronic unsafe staffing levels can lead to serious consequences 
for residents, family members, and workers.” It said, “Workers 
within Providence Place cannot be expected to work in an 
environment that is regularly and continuously short-staffed.” It 
said, “Workers and residents should not have to carry the 
burden of managing more with less on a constant basis.” And 
the letter warned that a major incident could happen because 
residents are being put at risk. 
 
This warning letter was sent in January. Two months later a 
vulnerable senior in the facility ate detergent pods and died. 
When did the Health minister become aware of this warning 
letter? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Again, Mr. Speaker, I think it’s 
important to put on the table, in terms of what is actually taking 
place at Providence Place, I know that there had been 
accusations that had been made, I believe, by members opposite 
when this case first came up, Mr. Speaker, that alluded to the 
use of not filling shifts at that particular facility and the heavy 
use of overtime at that facility, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I can tell the members opposite, over the first quarter of this 
calendar year at Providence Place, 8,365 shifts, Mr. Speaker, 
only 46 of those shifts went unfilled. Mr. Speaker, that is 0.54 
per cent. And the amount of overtime of those 8,365 shifts, Mr. 
Speaker, 142 were filled using overtime. Mr. Speaker, that is 
less than 2 per cent. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with respect to ensuring that we know the facts, 
Mr. Speaker, I think that’s very important. In the case that the 
members opposite raised, knowing what exactly happened, 
finding out what exactly happened, I’m not going to, as 
members opposite have done, jump to conclusions and issue a 
news release that is factually incorrect, Mr. Speaker, where a 
family actually learns things that aren’t true about their own 
family member, Mr. Speaker, about themselves through the 
news report, Mr. Speaker. I’m not going to do that. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Mr. Speaker, to the minister: when did he 
learn about the warning letter? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Well, Mr. Speaker, obviously the health 
region will have conversations with their union leadership, with 
their staff, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask of the member opposite, who actually 
issued the news release on the 10th, last week, when did she 
actually learn, Mr. Speaker, that the senior didn’t actually have 
dementia or Alzheimer’s, but then put it in a news release, Mr. 
Speaker, for that individual to actually read in the news? 



April 13, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6903 

Imagine the trauma of that, Mr. Speaker, asking your family 
member, why is the media saying this about me when this 
actually isn’t true, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Or saying that the police had to locate somebody, Mr. Speaker, 
when actually in fact what happened was it was a staff member 
that found the individual a block away, who decided to go out 
on a nice day, Mr. Speaker, after going out for church. This 
individual didn’t have dementia, Mr. Speaker. I think he had the 
love of the Lord in his heart and wanted to go to church and 
then enjoy nature afterwards, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it is irresponsible for the members opposite to 
issue a news release like this, but it’s not the first time they’ve 
done it. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 

POINT OF ORDER 
 
Hon. Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. I wish to raise a point of order regarding statements 
made by the Deputy Leader during the question period just 
previous. He made certain allegations regarding a special 
relationship that the Premier has, and certainly those are 
unfounded allegations. He was asked to elaborate on them and 
did not, Mr. Speaker. 
 
We would ask that you look into this matter and rule on a point 
of order. 
 
[14:15] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Opposition House Leader. 
 
Mr. McCall: — Mr. Speaker, certainly the member in question 
substantiated what he had to say. And if you review the records, 
Mr. Speaker, you’ll certainly find that to be the case, and you’ll 
find that the allegation by the member opposite is not well 
taken. 
 
The Speaker: — Thank you. I listened during question period. 
There were insinuations put forward, but there was no 
accusations of impropriety or criminal activities. If there are 
issues of criminal activity, then it’s incumbent on the member 
to bring that forward to the proper police authorities. Therefore 
I rule the point of order is not well taken. 
 
I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move 
that this House do now adjourn to accommodate the work of 
committees this afternoon and this evening. 
 
The Speaker: — The Government House Leader has moved 
that the House do now adjourn. Is it the pleasure of the 
Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Carried. This House stands adjourned to 1:30 
p.m. tomorrow. 
 

[The Assembly adjourned at 14:17.]
