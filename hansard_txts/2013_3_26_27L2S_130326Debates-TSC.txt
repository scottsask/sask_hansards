 SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON TRAFFIC SAFETY 3 

 March 26, 2013 

 

[The committee met at 17:07.] 

 

The Chair: — Welcome, members of the committee. To my 

left I have Deputy Chair Ms. Chartier, and with her of course is 

Mr. Vermette. To my right is Mr. Parent, Ms. Wilson, Mr. Cox, 

and Mr. Steinley. We have no substitutions tonight for this 

committee meeting. So welcome, everybody. 

 

The agenda today is to discuss the steering committee report 

which I would like to now table with the committee. You’ve 

just arrived, I know, but if you can look at the minutes there in 

front of you. Any questions on the report? 

 

Okay. Seeing no questions arising from the report you’re 

reading, I’d ask a member to move: 

 

That the first report of the steering committee be adopted. 

 

Mr. Cox: — So moved. 

 

The Chair: — Mr. Cox moved. Approved? All in favour? 

Carried. 

 

This report and other documents of the special committee will 

be available on the Legislative Assembly website. Since there’s 

no further business today, I will ask a member to move a 

motion to adjourn the meeting. 

 

Ms. Wilson: — I so move, Mr. Chair. 

 

The Chair: — Ms. Wilson so moves. All in favour? Approved. 

Thank you for attending. 

 

[The committee adjourned at 17:09.]
