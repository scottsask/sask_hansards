LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Fourth Session – Twelfth Legislature 

18th Day 

 

Monday, March 5, 1956 

 

The House met at 2:30 o’clock. 

 

On the Orders of the Day. 

 

Budget Address 

 

Hon. C. M. Fines (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, this is the twelfth occasion upon which I 

have been given privilege to rise in this House to introduce the traditional motion of Supply. A year ago, 

in the observance of Saskatchewan’s Golden Jubilee, it was also my very great honour to present the 

Province’s fiftieth budget. I suggested then that we had reached a notable milestone in our history – the 

end of the beginning. Now we are entered upon a new phase of development, conscious of our heritage, 

tempered by our trials, looking forward to the second half-century. 

 

Those who would assume a position of leadership in building for the future of Saskatchewan face a 

grace and heavy duty. Abundant as our new-found resources may be, as firm in spirit as the people are, 

nevertheless the tasks of the years ahead are many and great. The facts of our geography are no less 

harsh. The strains of Canadian nationhood are not yet resolved. And the course of international trade and 

political relations remains stubbornly unpredictable. In the face of difficulties such as these, the 

responsibility of democratic government to guide and assist in the continued economic growth and 

social progress of our Province is many-sided and perplexing. Its successful accomplishment calls for 

decisive judgment tempered by understanding, technical knowledge with administrative efficiency, 

vision rooted in realism. 

 

The annual budget may be likened to a mirror, testing whether the government of the day, or of those 

seeking to be the government, are possessed of such qualities and are equal to the challenge of the years 

ahead. In presenting the budget today, I am also conscious that the Government is now competing its 

twelfth year in office. I hope today, therefore, while concentrating upon our hopes and places for the 

future, to give as well a broad account of our stewardship over the past decade. 

 

National and International Trends 
 

In turning to the customary reviews of the economic background, I should like first to draw attention to 

a few highlights of the national and international scene. You will recall that a year ago, we were much 

concerned by the economic decline which had occurred in 1954. In both Canada and the United States, 

production had fallen while unemployment had risen to the highest level since the war. Fortunately 1955 

brought the overall recession to a welcome and early end. Recovery and expansion proved exceptionally 

strong; so much so that by the late fall inflationary tendencies had

provoked relatively severe restrictive policies by the monetary authorities in both countries. These 

economic trends were similar in part to those which had developed somewhat earlier in Western Europe, 

and particularly in the United Kingdom. In the latter county, moreover, a widening gap between imports 

from and exports to the dollar area caused a fairly sharp fall in gold and dollar reserves, thus pointing up 

once again the difficult trade position of the traditional market for our wheat. 

 

In Canada itself the national economy as a whole moved on to new high levels in 1955. Growth in 

population and consumer demand, capital investment and industrial production, inventories and foreign 

trade, employment and earnings, were all of marked importance. The “gross national product”, which 

measures the total value of all goods and services produced in the economy, recovered the ground lost in 

1954 by advancing some 10 per cent. 

 

The most disappointing aspect of 1955, however, was the failure of the recovery to extend to the farm 

income sector. Greatly increased physical production in agriculture in Western Canada contributed to a 

substantial gain in accrued personal income for the country as a whole. But farm cash returns declined 

by a further 2 ½ per cent. Prairie farmers were particularly affected. Here the decline amounted to over 5 

per cent. The basic explanation for this contradiction between production and income may be traced in 

the data on foreign trade. Although total exports from Canada reached a new height in 1955, the export 

value of what and what flour fell about 10 per cent below the level of the previous year. The relative 

movement of prices, moreover, brought further serious problems to our farmers. The remarkable 

stability in the general price level is now seen to be due to the fact that the inflationary pressure 

generated by the industrial boom has been largely offset by continuing weakness in farm product prices 

and has been largely offset by continuing weakness in farm product prices and reduced demand from the 

agricultural sector. In a sense it may be said that to date the farmers of Canada have had thrust upon 

them an involuntary burden of restraining inflation throughout the national economy. 

 

Saskatchewan Economy 
 

With respect to the Saskatchewan economy itself, I need not dwell at any length upon the familiar story 

of recent developments. Nevertheless, I should like to re-emphasize certain broad trends and draw 

attention to some significant aggregates which underlie the growth in our provincial finances. 

 

Although the current fall in farm cash income is not doubt our most pressing problem, in my view the 

most significant economic development of 1955 was the amazing recovery in the physical output of our 

farms. The damaging effects of rust, floods, curtailed acreage, weeds and insect pests, were successfully 

overcome. In the result, one of the best crops in the fifty years’ history of the province was grown and 

harvested. All told, the physical output of grain jumped from 302 million bushels in 1954 to over 572 

million in 1955. With substantial improvement in quality, the aggregate value of this production was 

approximately doubled. 

 

Unfortunately, as we all know, the grains in production were not 

  



 

March 5, 1956

matched by any upturn in cash income. The decline in exports, and the failure of the Federal 

Government to assure maximum use of available storage capacity, have curtailed deliveries to country 

elevators in the first half of the current crop year by almost 25 per cent. In this province total farm cash 

receipts from all sources amounted to $449 million in 1955, compared with $473 million the previous 

year. As against this, a first estimate of accrued net income, taking into account the value of larger farm 

inventories, is placed at about $310 million. This is a gain of some 150 per cent over the exceedingly 

low level experienced in the previous crop failure year. But it is evident that the worsening relationship 

between the prices of goods and services paid for by farmers and the prices received for farm products 

continues to eat into net income. This cost-price squeeze upon net income remains as perhaps the most 

disturbing aspect of the current and prospective farm picture. If the ratio of costs to prices in 1945 is 

taken as 100, the comparable ratio in 1955 has risen to approximately 162.4. The latter calculation 

makes no allowance for final payments on western grains, but it is clear that the relationship has swung 

against the farmers by at least 50 per cent. It had, in fact, deteriorated to the unfavourable situation 

existing before the last war. 

 

Non-Farm Expansion 
 

In the budget address of one year ago, I noted that despite the severe difficulties encountered by our 

farmers in Saskatchewan economy in 1954 was maintained at a very high level. The same buoyant 

forces have been operative in even stronger degree throughout 1955. We have had a further object 

lesion, a further demonstration of new-found resilience and diversity in our economic foundations. I 

have already mentioned the vigorous physical recovery of agricultural output. It has been matched by a 

steady expansion and an increasing relative importance of the non-farm industries. In 1945, these 

industries accounted for only 22 per cent of the net value of commodity output as compared with 78 per 

cent for agriculture. In 1955, in contrast, while agriculture still remained the major activity as much as 

40 per cent of net production came from the mines and power stations, the oil and gas fields, the lakes 

and forests, the factories, workshops and construction industry. The remarkable growth in these other 

basic industries has gone far toward taking up the slack in our economy caused by the decline in farm 

earnings. 

 

As in 1954, the most striking gains have again been recorded in the mineral industries. The Federal 

Government for the first time has published data on radio-active ores. It is now possible therefore to give 

a complete figure for mining in Saskatchewan. In 1955 uranium production rose to an estimated $14 

million, and the total value of mineral output jumped by 23 per cent, rising to some $84 million in 

comparison to only $24 million ten years ago. The oil industry continued to forge ahead, again doubling 

its physical output and advancing 120 per cent in value. The number of productive oil and gas wells has 

now risen to 1,850, and proven reserves of crude petroleum to more than 500 million barrels. In the 

north, the production of base metals gained a further 17 per cent in value; our southern coal mines 

accounted for a fifth of total Canadian output; and new high levels of activity were achieved in a wide 

variety of industrial minerals, including brick and clay, sand and gravel, common salt and sodium 

sulphate, and in potash development. 

  



 

March 5, 1956

The other resource-based industries – forestry, fishing and trapping – all enjoyed a particularly good 

year in 1955. Strong market conditions were combined with effective management and utilization 

programs, resulting in substantial gains for production, employment and income. In electric power, the 

extremely rapid rate of increase in provincial consumption continues unabated. The output of central 

electric stations rose by over 16 per cent to reach some 850 million kwh. In the construction industry the 

value of work performed reached $274 million in 1954. The intentions forecast at the beginning of 1955 

showed a slight decline, but final figures are likely to show that the level of activity was maintained at 

the previous peak. In manufacturing, the value of factory shipments rose to $282 million in 1954, 

making the largest annual increase since the inflation of the Korean war and double the average rate of 

growth since 1951. Employment in manufacturing has remained strong throughout 1955, and production 

values for the year have been forecast at close to $300 million. 

 

Population, Employment and Income 

 

In tying together all the many strands of the provincial economy, it is obvious that for the second year in 

succession the depressing influence of lowered farm earnings has been substantially resisted. At June 1, 

the Dominion Bureau of Statistics estimated our total population at 889,000. It is gratifying to not that at 

the recent Ottawa conference on health insurance, the Saskatchewan population is forecast at 905,000 in 

1956 – a gain of 9 per cent in five years. This is particularly significant when it is recalled that between 

1936 and 1946 our population declined from 932,000 to 833,000 persons. At the seasonal peak last 

August, the labour force had risen to a postwar record. The total number of employed persons was 

estimated at about 324,000 – a rise of 10,000 over the previous high in 1953. This is also reflected in the 

substantial gain in labour income, estimated at about $420 million compared with $404 million in the 

previous year and only $161 million in 1944. In total, while the realized income of all Saskatchewan 

residents remained at just about the same level as in 1954, accrued personal income climbed again over 

the $1 billion mark. In per capita terms this will be about equal to the national average. 

 

Economic Prospect in 1956 
 

Now what of the prospect for the year ahead? Obviously the most important questions concern markets 

for farm products and the continuing problem of cost-price relationships in the farm economy. These are 

difficult and perplexing problems. Their solutions must clearly be sought within a framework of national 

and international policy. The Wheat Board has made the careful statement that exports in the current 

crop year ending next July will approximate the same level as in 1954-55. If this is true, and adequate 

measures are taken immediately to utilize storage capacity to the full, farmers’ marketings should 

undoubtedly improve substantially. The latest reports on foreign crops indicate some prospect for 

improved wheat markets in the next crop year. Despite the refusal of the United Kingdom to enter a new 

International Wheat Agreement, we are still hopeful that helpful results will emerge from the current 

discussions in Geneva. This may be achieved if the talks lead to some softening of policies of 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

5 
 

greater agricultural self-sufficiency in Western Europe. As the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 

United Nations points out, such a development would be greatly assisted by a relaxation of world 

tension and the easing of international payments difficulties. In all of this we must certainly continue to 

urge that the Canadian Government should provide a dynamic, constructive lead. 

 

In any circumstances, if deliveries this year equal the level of 1954-55, farmers will still have on hand 

about 260 million: — grain at July 31 next. About 156 million will be wheat of very high quality, so that 

the economy will be well insulated against any possible crop disaster. Cash income would of course be 

greatly improved if the Federal Government would agree to cash advances on farm-stored grain. 

However, we do welcome the pending legislation under which storage charges are to be paid on that part 

of the wheat carryover in commercial position exceeding 178 million bushels. This plan, together with 

the interim payment on the 1954-55 wheat crop, should add about $36 million to normal agricultural 

income in Saskatchewan this calendar year. Provided price declines can be avoided, the rising livestock 

population on our farms noted in the annual December count, suggests a further increment of cash 

income from this important source. 

 

As to the balance of our economy, I am confident that the gains achieved to date will be surpassed in 

1956. True there are many signs that the industrial boom in both Canada and the United States is now 

slackening off, and this may weaken markets slightly. But growth factors are strongly operative within 

the provincial economy. Important increases in mineral production are well in sight. The exploration and 

development program continues to grow in scope and intensity. According to the magazine “Oil in 

Canada”, total expenditure on petroleum development in Saskatchewan in 1956 will reach $95,500,000, 

up by more than $10 million over 1955. Copper, uranium and potash will also share the spotlight. 

Interest is higher than ever in the potential utilization of forest resources. This applies not only to our 

pulp and paper potential, but also to other wood-using industries such as plywood, blockboard and 

wallboard, and studies now underway may well lead to important new projects being launched this year. 

The imposing list of new plants and plant expansions already line up – steel pipe, cement, wire and 

cable, strawboard, sewer pipe, and so forth – all point toward a record year for manufacturing 

investment. Both engineering and building construction seem likely to remain at peak levels. The service 

sector will be greatly stimulated by the further growth in basic industries and the anticipated upturn in 

total realized income. In the overall picture, capital investment should be maintained at a very high level 

and as the budget detail will disclose, the provincial government’s own plans for capital construction 

will continue to play a vital role in Saskatchewan’s continued economic growth in 1956. 

 

Dominion-Provincial Relations 
 

Before proceeding to the budget itself, I must deal with a further broad and important topic. Those 

members of the House who have served here since 1944 (and it is a real pleasure to observe just how 

numerous they are, especially to your right, Mr. Speaker) will recall that one of the first tasks of the 

present Government was to settle some 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

6 

 

long-standing financial problems with the Dominion. My first three budget addresses dealt at some 

length, therefore, with such major issues as the repayment of the seed-grain loans, the settlement of the 

tremendous relief indebtedness incurred during the thirties, the resolution of the natural compensation 

dispute, and the first post-war tax rental agreement which grew out of the Conference on 

Reconstruction. During the past year a series of federal-provincial meetings and conferences has also 

dealt with several basic issues, all of which are of particular relevance to our financial position. 

 

The first of these has to do with the recurrent question of unemployment relief. As I have already 

recalled, the economic downturn in 1954 brought in its wake a serious fall in employment. By the time 

the first federal-provincial meeting was held in April, the unemployment level had climbed so high and 

such pressure had been brought to bear upon Ottawa, that it was clear the Federal Government would be 

impelled to face up to the problem. As the printed record of the meeting will indicate, the provinces 

were united in their hope that the Dominion would indicate, the provinces were united in their hope that 

the Dominion would at last move to carry out in full the proposal it had made in 1945, “to establish a 

practicable and comprehensive system of assistance to able-bodied unemployed persons. . .” 

 

The federal plan is finally presented to the provinces following a further meeting in June fell far short of 

these expectations. In principle it requires the provinces to continue to carry the full burden of aid for 

unemployable persons in need. But in addition, it expects the provinces to carry 50 per cent of the cost 

of relief for the able-bodied unemployed not protected by unemployment insurance. Admitting the 

practical difficulty of distinguishing clearly between the employable and the unemployable categories, 

the plan provides for an arithmetic formula to draw the required line. The provinces and their 

municipalities are left with complete responsibility for all persons receiving social aid up to the level of 

.45 per cent of the total provincial population. When the social aid rolls exceed this percentage, the 

Federal Government will then contribute 50 per cent of actual expenditures on the excess number. 

 

Several important conditions and exclusions are written into the agreement as drafted by Ottawa. I shall 

not attempt to comment upon these, other than to note that their main effect is to reduce the extent of 

responsibility to be shared by the Federal Government. Over the past several months we have conducted 

extensive discussions and correspondence aimed at improving the original draft agreement. Some 

concessions have been won. But on important questions such as our urging a more intelligent handling 

of mothers’ allowance caseloads and the inclusion of relief payments issued under work and wages 

programs the Federal Government has taken an adamant contrary stand. Nevertheless, we have now 

indicated a willingness in principle to sign an agreement and are presently exploring the best method of 

passing on to the municipalities a fair share of any assistance which may be eventually received from 

Ottawa. 

 

The second broad problem taken up in federal-provincial discussions during the past year has been the 

matter of fiscal relations. I do not intend to take up the time of the House today by tracing the long 

background not the extensive negotiations which culminated in the 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

7 
 

formal proposal advanced by the Federal Government. The outlines of the scheme are contained in a 

letter from the Prime Minister of January 6th last. It will be useful to record here the salient features of 

the new approach which replaces the existing tax-rental agreements as of April 1, 1957. For the sake of 

clarity, let me set them out in point form. 

 

1) The Federal Government is prepared to make room in the three main direct tax fields – personal 
income, corporation income, and inheritances – for the provinces to re-enter these fields. Where 

a province desires to do so, in an attempt to avoid duplicate taxation, the Dominion will reduce 

the existing federal rates to a defined extent, described as the “standard rates”. 

 

2) These standard rates are 10 per cent of the federal tax on personal income (excluding the Old 
Age Security tax); 9 per cent of the taxable income of corporations earned in the particular 

province; and 50 per cent of the federal succession duty. 

 

3) As an alternative to re-entering these tax fields, a province may elect to rent out any or all to the 
Dominion, which will in turn pay to the province a rental amount equal to the imputed yield 

within the province of the tax or taxes at the standard rates. 

 

4) Recognizing that these direct taxes are collected on incomes which flow from the entire national 
economy, the Federal Government will make unconditional equalization payments to the 

provinces. These annual payments will be such as to bring the combined per capita yield of the 

standard taxes in each province up to the average per capita yield of these taxes in the two 

provinces which have the highest combined yields. 

 

5) A stabilization guarantee is provided. In the first year, 1957-58, it is based on the amount 
payable in the final year of the present agreement; in subsequent years it is geared to the level of 

preceding payments. 

 

6) Under certain conditions the Federal Government will make its facilities available to any 
province for collection of provincial taxes on personal or corporation income on an agency fee 

basis. 

 

7) Where a province imposes corporation taxes based other than on profits, any levy in excess of 
the higher of the standard rate or any general tax on profits imposed by the province will be 

allowed as an expense to the corporation to be deducted from taxable income. The resulting 

losses to the Federal Government will be deducted from any payments due to the province under 

the plan. 

 

It will be clear from the foregoing outline that there is little advantage, if any, in electing to rent out sole 

occupancy of the tax fields to the Federal Government. This is the essential difference from the existing 

arrangements which were aimed among other things, at the maintenance of a co-ordinated tax system in 

Canada. In contrast, the new proposals do make it possible for each province to follow an independent 

course in tax policy. 

 

It is not easy, Mr. Speaker, to pass brief and simple judgment 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

8 

 

upon a problem so complex and so intertwined with the whole federal system of government in Canada. 

The new approach has certain merits and advantages. Some of these will undoubtedly appeal more to 

some provinces than to others. For our part, we have attempted to approach the question with two main 

things in mind: first, that a desirable solution will incorporate principles of long-run benefit to the whole 

Canadian people; and second, that we have a duty to our own province to seek as large a revenue as 

possible on its behalf. 

 

On the first point, we have voiced the concern that the new proposals may so weaken the powers of 

fiscal management in the hands of the Dominion as to prove a real handicap in combating a serious 

depression. The proposals also seem to us to beckon the provinces back into the corporation tax field, 

and thus to pave the way to a return of duplicate, overlapping and inconsistent systems of taxation. 

Moreover, despite the equalization provision, little heed is paid to the undisputed fact that there are 

important regions of the country where fiscal resources are frequently so slender that special aid is 

obviously required if standards of services are to be brought up to a minimum national standard. 

 

On the second aspect, the latest estimates brought forward at a recent meeting of officials suggests that 

some improvement in revenue is in prospect for Saskatchewan as compared with the present tax-rental 

agreement. It is not entirely clear, however, just how substantial this margin might be in future years, 

and particularly in comparison with a modest adjustment of the existing system. A further conference is 

now to be held in Ottawa next Friday, at which time we hope that the outstanding questions can be 

resolved. We shall then be in a position to undertake a final appraisal and determine just which course 

the Province should follow. 

 

As the House will know, health insurance has also been a major topic occupying the Federal-Provincial 

stage during the past year. At the agenda meeting in April, Saskatchewan recalled the 1945 federal 

commitment to meet up to 60 per cent of the cost of provincial health insurance plans, and asked that the 

“next step toward building a comprehensive national health insurance scheme” be taken up at the 

plenary conference. In particularly, we urged that the Dominion should make a clear-cut declaration as 

to just what it was prepared to do in this regard. We were much heartened by the interest and support 

voiced during the discussion by the Governments of Ontario and British Columbia. 

 

When the conference was convened last October, it was evident that the converted efforts of our three 

provinces had finally pushed a reluctant Federal Government into take a definite stand. In his opening 

statement to the conference the Prime Minister enunciated two points; first, that diagnostic services and 

hospital insurance should have priority; and second that the Federal Government would consider itself 

justified in participating financially if a majority of the provinces representing a majority of the 

Canadian people were prepared to embark upon provincially-administered health insurance schemes. 

 

Again at the urging of the same three provinces, the Conference agreed to set up a committee of health 

and finance minters to assure that the matter would be pursued further. This Committee met in Ottawa in 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

9 
 

January and the Federal Government then made known what financial aid it was prepared to give under 

the commitment of last October, together with the general terms and conditions to be required of the 

provinces. 

 

Briefly, the approach taken by the Dominion is this. It will pay a specified portion of defined “shareable 

costs” of provincial plans which provide universal coverage for diagnostic services and hospital care. 

The “shareable costs” are to be limited to normal operating and maintenance costs for standard ward 

care. They therefore exclude any capital costs, and do not extend to mental hospitals, tuberculosis 

treatment, or particular groups otherwise protected. The actual contribution by the Dominion is to be 

worked out on a formula which results in a sliding scale of federal assistance to provincial programs. It 

ranges from a low of 45 per cent in B.C. to a high of 72 per cent in Newfoundland. The federal 

contribution to Saskatchewan is the third lowest, amounting to an estimated 47 per cent. A sum of about 

$11,000,000 in support of our Hospital Services Plan is therefore involved. 

 

I must repeat here the qualifications already stressed both by the provincial minister of health and 

myself. There is, of course, no prospect that this assistance will in fact materialize for some time to 

come. It is extremely unlikely that the required number of provinces will be able to set approved 

insurance programs in motion before 1958. When this is finally achieved, and when the Federal 

Government is at long last participating in the first step toward comprehensive health insurance, the 

people of Saskatchewan will have real cause for pride. They will know that their pioneering efforts with 

Saskatchewan’s hospital plan have certainly been the main instrument through which this notable 

victory for social progress has been won for the people of Canada. 

 

1954-55 Fiscal Year 
 

I come now, Mr. Speaker, to the actual finances of the Province. The Public Accounts for 1954-55, 

which were tabled at the beginning of this session, show that for the fourteenth successive year a surplus 

on revenue account was achieved. Based on revenues of $82,696,000, and expenditures of $78,154,000, 

the surplus amounted to $4,542,000. A heavy capital program of nearly $20,500,000 was financed from 

liquor profits of $10,207,000, and from the accumulated surplus of previous years. Advances to the 

Power Corporation and to Government Telephones, financed by capital borrowing, reached 

$21,736,000. In spite of the heavy capital program, I am pleased to announce that the net debt was 

reduced in 1954-55 by a further $12,316,000. 

 

1955-56 Fiscal Year 
 

In spite of the troubles besetting our farm economy, the financial position of the Province remains strong 

this fiscal year. Revenues are running at a slightly higher level than in 1954-55, chiefly due to increased 

returns from mineral and natural resources. 

 

Normal expenditures on revenue and capital accounts will conform closely to the budgetary plan. The 

Department of Highways incurred 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

10 

 

over-expenditure on maintenance, and were unable to complete their entire construction program largely 

because of the extreme flood conditions of last spring. This situation has also been responsible for 

substantial over-expenditure on revenue account. To meet the emergency, the Government make 

available a special vote of $1,000,000 to assist municipalities in carrying out necessary repairs to 

damaged roads and bridges. A further $1,000,000 was provided for flood control measures in an 

extensive program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture. As a consequence of these emergency 

expenditures, I anticipate that for the first time since 1950-51, it will be necessary to transfer a portion of 

liquor control revenues to balance the revenue account budget. 

 

Capital Financing 1955-56 
 

The present fiscal year has seen a very heavy capital program financed in a manner that has provided 

large sums of capital at favourable rates of interest and with repayment provisions that should result in 

very little burden in years to come. All debenture borrowing to date this fiscal year has been for 

advances to the Power and Telephone Corporations. Not only has it made provision for all the 

requirements of the present fiscal year for these corporations but it will look after their needs for the first 

six months of 1956-57. The following table indicates the borrowings referred to:

 Jan. 2, 1956   Jan. 2, 1976 3 ¼% U.S.A.  25,000,000 

 

 

In addition to the above program, the Province has issued treasury bills in the sum of $4,000,000 for 

highway construction. These bills are presently being held in various government accounts. Similarly 

with treasury bills totalling $4,445,982, which were issued to finance the balance outstanding on the 

prior redemption of $7,500,000 debentures payable in 1960. By redeeming these debentures in advance, 

there will be a saving in interest charges of about $165,000 annually. It is expected that some of these 

treasury bills will be funded in the near future. 

 

During the year the treasury bills and debentures have been paid off as they became due. In addition, the 

1960 issues were called for prior redemption as noted in the following table:

This was done by cancelling the bonds held in the general sinking fund, since no specific fund had been 

established to take care of any of these particular issues. This action has not changed the net debt but has 

reduced the gross debt and, of course, the amount in the sinking funds. The interest rate on outstanding 

debt is down from 4.539% on April 30, 1944, to 3.671% last December 31st. 

 

Debt Reduction 

 

Despite the fact that the Province found it necessary to borrow this past year for highway construction 

work, once again I am able to report a reduction in the net public debt of $9,328,000. This brings the net 

down to $70,538,000 or $79.35 per capita at December 31, 1955. This is a total reduction in 12 years of 

$106,785,000 or $131 per capita, as is indicated in the following table:

Revenue and Capital Budgets For 1956-57 
 

The estimates for next year, 1956-57, reflect a substantial growth in the economic strength of the 

Province. They provide for the following revenues and expenditures: 

 

On Revenue Account:  

Estimated Revenues............ $87,172,000 

Estimated Expenditures........... 87,147,080 

  

Estimated Surplus............. $  24,920 

  

On Capital Account:  

Estimated Expenditures........... $20,215,000 

 

The people of Saskatchewan will be pleased, as I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, that improved public 

services will be possible next year without any increases in taxation. They will be proud, as the 

Government is proud, that expanding revenues from natural resources will make the most important 

contribution to this improvement in services. 

 

Education 
 

The largest single increase in the 19956-57 estimates is for the Department of Education. This vote is 

raised by $2,240,000. It brings the total estimate for the Department up to $17,278,000, or very close to 

20 per cent of the revenue account budget. Of first importance are the 



 

March 5, 1956 

13 
 

grants to local schools. These are increased by $1,777,000, bringing the total to $12,212,000. The 

additional vote for 1956-57 follows upon a series of similar increases over the past several years. With 

the proposed further boost, it is estimated that grants per enrolled pupil will exceed $60, compared with 

only $15 in 1943-44. I may add that the Government gas been giving the most careful study and 

attention to the financial problems of our school system, and it is our firm intention to continue to accord 

the highest priority possible to the educational needs of the Province. 

 

To assist with the heavy school building program, the House will be asked to vote $400,000 for loans to 

school units and districts, an increase of $100,000. Moreover, the Government plans again to purchase 

up to $1,000,000 of school debentures for its trust funds. Next year therefore, the Province will provide 

$1,400,000 in loans for the building of local schools. I recall that twelve years ago, capital assistance of 

this kind of virtually did not exist. 

 

Nor has higher education been neglected. Changes in the Canadian economy in general and the 

Saskatchewan economy in particular are creating new demands for the professionally and technically 

trained person. At the university level, funds are increased by $235,000, raising the total to $1,935,000. 

Further, as the Throne Speech made known, the Department is working on plans for the establishment of 

a provincial technical institute, designed to meet the obvious need for new industrial skills. 

 

Public Health 
 

In the field of public health, the 1956-57 budget provides for total expenditures of over $23 ¾ million. 

The strides we have made in Saskatchewan are well recognized. In 1944, the budget provided 36 cents 

per capita for programs aimed at the prevention of illness. Today the comparable figure is $1.59 per 

capita. Nearly 50 per cent of the population is now included in eight organized health regions, not 

including the cities of Regina and Saskatoon, which operate their own health departments. Similarly, for 

the care of the sick, this budget make available about $24 per capita compared with a little over $3 just 

ten years ago. The wide range of services available in Saskatchewan – the hospital plan, free cancer 

treatment, free treatment for tuberculosis, medical services for pensioners, the air ambulance service, 

and many other programs, have place Saskatchewan in the vanguard of health care in Canada. 

 

Nor are the mentally ill any longer the forgotten men and women of Saskatchewan. Our expenditures on 

the mental hospitals alone amounted to $6.25 per capita in 1954-55, as compared with the average of 

$2.95 per capita being spent by all other governments in Canada in the same year. Perhaps of even 

greater significance for the future is the expenditure of $237,000 on mental health clinics and 

community services, and on psychiatric research, bringing our total per capita expenditures on mental 

health to over $8.00 in 1956-57. We have been much heartened by the growing public interest in this 

terribly important field. Much remains to be done, but the figures I have quoted give some measure of 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

14 

 

our effort. We have reached the point where the ration of patients discharged from the hospitals, as 

compared with those admitted, has improved immeasurably over the unhappy pattern of a few years ago. 

It is our aim to seek further steady advance, and particularly to continue to press for the inclusion of the 

mental hospitals in the plan for federally-aided hospital insurance. 

 

Social Welfare 
 

Expenditures for social welfare in 1956-57 will be up by over $1,000,000 to more than $10,000,000. 

The welfare programs are wide and varied in scope. Almost $6,000,000 will be voted to provide aid for 

those in greatest need. There is expanded provision for the aged and infirm, for the care of hundreds of 

unfortunate children, for rehabilitation of the handicapped, and for an improved corrections program. 

 

It must be recognized that progress cannot be measured in terms of dollar expenditure alone. The 

employment of trained social workers in our public assistance programs, for example, has meant an 

improvement in the kind of services being provided by the department. No longer are we satisfied 

merely to dole out relief to needy families, ignoring the problems that face them. It is recognized by our 

social workers that other forms of advice and assistance must be made available wherever possible. 

 

Expenditures on child welfare have risen from less than $200,000 a decade ago to $1,296,000 in 1956-

57. The improved quality of this service is especially gratifying. No longer is there a vote “Grants to 

Orphanages”. Today, children are given a more natural and normal life through the foster home 

program. We owe a great debt of appreciation to the many hundreds of foster mothers in the province 

who are giving a service impossible to evaluate in terms of dollars and cents. 

 

At the opposite end of the age scale, the budget reflects in full the cost of the improved supplemental 

allowances introduced last year to assist the needy aged. Moreover it provides further expanded 

assistance for the care of the infirm in nursing homes and for housing for senior citizens. Since 1944, the 

number of public and private nursing home beds has more than tripled. The budget provides $995,000 in 

support of these institutions, and a sum of $275,000 in grants to the rapidly expanding program of local 

homes for the pioneer residents of the providence. 

 

Agricultural Development 

 

To finance these humanitarian measure, society must be willing either to accept substantial increases in 

the tax burden, or to undertake measures for the expansion of the economy in order that the same taxes 

on our provincial wealth might yield more revenue. It is the latter road that this Government is 

attempting to travel. There have been substantial changes in the agricultural economy of Saskatchewan, 

as we all know, and the government is constantly seeking methods by which it can assist farmers in 

improving the level and quality of agricultural production. The budget provides over $5,000,000 for just 

this purpose.

It is difficult to measure the results of extension programs such as those carried on by the Agricultural 

Representative Branch, the Plant Industry Branch, and the Animal Industry Branch. There is no question 

that weather plays the major role in determining crop yields, but I think there is little doubt either that 

improved tillage methods, crop variety improvement, moisture conservation, fertilizers and control of 

weeds and insect pests have all played an important part in boosting average yields. 

 

In direct assistance to farmers for improving agricultural productivity, expenditures on drainage, 

irrigation, forage and pasture projects have risen from just over $14,000 in 1944 to $1,868,000 in 1956-

57. Expenditures on clearing and breaking of land have risen from virtually nothing to an average of 

$1,000,000 per year over the past three years. Behind these dollar figures one can point to very 

significant results, not the least of which is the increase of 2,000,000 acres in the area of occupied farm 

lands in the last decade. 

 

Resource Development 
 

Honourable Members have heard much in previous debates of the great progress being made in the 

development of our oil and natural gas resources, our metallic and industrial mineral deposits, our 

manufacturing industries, and in the scientific management of our forest. Government programs 

contributing to this development are numerous and varied. To mention just a few examples, nearly 

$50,000 will have spent in four years in prospectors’ assistance; over $200,000 will have been spent in a 

five year period on the forest inventory; and well over half a million dollars will have been spent, over 

the same period, on industrial minerals research, and on basic and applied research by the Saskatchewan 

Research council. For 1956-57, the budget provides almost $4,000,000 for the two Resource 

Departments. The construction of northern access roads and airfields alone, estimated at $529,000 will 

exceed the total vote on resources development in 1943-44. 

 

Policies for the stimulation of the oil and natural gas industry have also been new and varied. The 

Government has introduced, for example, the net royalty lease on crown oil reserves, a policy 

substantially different from that of outright sale of these valuable acreages. Instead of seeking immediate 

financial returns from these resources, and making political capital out of the programs that could be 

financed in this way, the Government has been willing to accept instead an annual return in the form of a 

royalty over and above the regular royalty. In renting our resources in this way, we are not only 

benefiting future generations, but we are also making it possible for smaller independent oil companies, 

financed in many cases by Canadian capital, to participate in the development of our resources. 

 

Programs such as these have been combined in our general development policy to achieve the truly 

remarkable results with which you are all familiar. In budgetary terms alone these advances may be 

measured by the revenues from mineral resources – over $10,500,000 estimated for 1956-57 compared 

with $250,000 in 1943-44.

Industrial Development 

 

Hand in hand with the development of resource industries must come the growth of secondary 

industries. The 1956-57 budget provides for the stimulation of industrial development by private capital, 

co-operative capital, and public capital. In this regard, I draw your attention to the able contribution of 

the Industrial Development Office. In just five years, it has assisted in bringing to this province such 

industries as a pipe mill, a plywood factory, a generator winding plant, a garment factory, a farm 

equipment manufacturing enterprise, a cement plant – to name but a few. The Industrial Development 

Fund, which a few years ago counted a $50,000 loan to a new company as a major transaction, is 

expected this year to lend up to $500,000. 

 

In the co-operative sector of the economy, the Department of Co-operation and Co-operative 

Development will receive a total vote of close to $355,000 to continue its work of assisting the 

development of co-operatives and credit unions. The investment by the co-operative movement in 

industrial expansion in Saskatchewan – in the form of producing oil fields, refinery facilities, wholesale 

and retail trade – has had a significant impact on our growth. The Saskatchewan Co-operative Credit 

Society, to which this Government regularly provides short term capital, and whose loans are often 

guaranteed under the Co-operative Guarantee Act, is playing an important role in assisting this 

contribution. 

 

Together with private and co-operative development, the two large government utilities are helping to 

change the face of Saskatchewan. The Power Corporation will receive advances of nearly $26,700,000 

in 1956-57. This amount will be borrowed by the Province and loaned to the Corporation at cost, to 

enable it to expand power and natural gas facilities, and the rural electrification system. I think we may 

count ourselves fortunate that Saskatchewan’s credit position has so improved that we are able to 

finance not only the expanding power program, but also the distribution of natural gas to so many parts 

of the Provinces. 

 

Paralleling the tremendous growth of the Power Corporation, is that of Saskatchewan Government 

Telephones. In 1956-57 the Government will lend to the Corporation $9,500,000 for investment in 

micro-wave facilities, in telephone lines and installations, and in central exchange equipment. Like the 

Power Corporation, the Telephone Company will augment the loans from the Treasury with depreciation 

reserves and its retained surplus, with the result that the total investment by the two corporations will 

exceed $45,000,000. 

 

Crown Corporations 
 

I turn now to a question of perennial interest and importance to Honourable Members, - the performance 

of the smaller business enterprises operating under authority of the Crown Corporations Act. As the 

individual reports being table in the House will reveal, these corporations have enjoyed the best financial 

year on record. The net earnings of the entire group of eight companies for fiscal years ending in 1955 

totals 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

17 
 

$1,366,284. At the same year-ends, total advances invested by the Government amounted to $9,633,688. 

The rate of return on our investment stood therefore at 14.18 per cent. This is an income ration 

substantially higher than that achieved by the Power and Telephone Utilities, calculated on a comparable 

basis before the interest charges. 

 

I think it worthwhile today, however, to go behind and beyond this simple measure of financial success. 

I should like to review again the basic purposes which underlay the establishment of the crown 

companies. Let me recalls some of the problems of ten years ago – both general and specific – that 

public investment in business enterprises was designed to help overcome. 

 

In the first place there was an urgent need to do everything possible to increase the flow of capital into 

industrial development, both for diversifying out one-sided economy and providing new hob 

opportunities. Before 1945 the inflow of investment capital into this province had fallen to a particularly 

low level, and for as long as fifteen years Saskatchewan had been lagging far behind other provinces in 

industrial growth. Second, the relatively primitive state of many essential services demanded, their rapid 

improvement. Not only was this needed to spur economic growth, but also to reduce the costs of 

services and goods to consumers and producers alike. Third, it was clear that neither essential long-

range programs of conservation, nor the maximum return to the people of the Province, could be secured 

by continuing the then existing policies of wasteful exploitation of natural resources. 

 

These were some of the problems. It was certainly never thought that they could all be solved by a 

modest investment of public funds in a small number of crown companies. But it was expected that the 

companies would make their own contribution to the overall need for development. They were to 

indicate our own faith in possibilities for effective investment in Saskatchewan. And they were expected 

to provide workable answers to a number of specific problems, particularly in basic service fields. I 

think it can be said, with all fairness and conviction, that we have achieved just these results. 

 

In terms of employment and income, for example, the eight companies provided hobs for a minimum of 

1,237 persons in 1955. The great majority of these jobs were only made available in Saskatchewan as a 

direct result of corporation programs. In ten years the wage bill has totalled over $27 million. It is not 

possible to estimate accurately what the indirect economic results of this employment and income have 

been. A publication of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce entitled “What New Industrial Jobs Mean to a 

Community” sheds some light on the question of the income and employment multiplier. Based on a 

study of nine U.S. counties, the report shows that 100 new industrial jobs led to a further gain of 74 

workers in supporting services, a population increase of 296 persons, and 112 additional new 

households. It can be inferred from the results and generate through multiplier effects at least $6 million 

annually in personal income and an increase of $3 million in retail trade. 

  



 

March 5, 1956

Several examples of benefits to the people of the province in terms of better services and reduced costs 

readily come to mind. The bus company has greatly improved road transport facilities in many parts of 

Saskatchewan and Government Airways has played a hew role in opening up our northland. Insurance 

premiums have been held down or reduced; lower cost building materials assured; and higher returns to 

producers through the fish and fur marketing services, combined with cheaper goods through 

Government Trading, have helped to raise the standard of living in northern areas. 

 

In respect to increasing returns from natural resources, only one example need be cited. In 1955, the 

Timber Board returned $1,156,853 in stumpage dues and net earnings. This is in contrast to only 

$670,992 paid in royalties in the previous peak year, 1943-44, when private operators cut out twice the 

volume of timber as was harvested in 1955. 

 

To be sure, Mr. Speaker, our experience in the field of crown corporations has not been without its 

problems nor its failures. Over a period of years, four operations had to be abandoned at a total cost, 

including both operating and capital losses, of $1,350,418. These included the fish board, the shoe 

factory and tannery here in Regina, and the woollen mill at Moose Jaw. With respect to the 

manufacturing plants, the problems of management ability and production skills, and particularly the 

limitations of local markets, combined against their success. Perhaps the major error, however, lay in 

their timing. The projects were launched before the development of our basic resources had reached a 

momentum sufficient to create an industrial climate in the province. For my part, I look back to these 

early failures sure in the belief that before many years have passed industries such as these, and many 

others besides, will be making their proper contribution to the expanding economy of Saskatchewan. 

 

In addition to the four enterprises I have just mentioned, two other companies were wound up after the 

specific task assigned to them were successfully completed. These were the Reconstruction Corporation 

and the Reconstruction Housing Corporation. They closed with an accumulated surplus of $486,000. 

 

Now what of the overall financial results of the past ten years? Let us look at the record, as disclosed by 

the yearly audited statements of each and every company. To date the total of annual surpluses comes to 

$8,118,000. Against this there are accumulated deficits, including the losses already mentioned, of 

$1,746,000. The net accumulated profit, therefore, is $6,372,000. 

 

Moreover, as I have pointed out, the figure on the losses of closed companies includes a full allowance 

for capital deficits. It would therefore be fair to estimate our capital gains. If the average net profit 

earned over the past five years is capitalized at five per cent, we can secure an objective measure of the 

present capital valuation of our operating companies. This gives us a total capital sum of $18,184,000. 

When we subtract the actual amount invested by the government, the remainder represents our capital 

gain. It amounts to $8,550,000. Over the ten years, 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

19 
 

Therefore, against total losses of $1,746,000 there may be offset the sum of operating profits and capital 

gains amounting to $16,668,000. I doubt that there is a businessman in Canada who would not be 

justifiably proud of a record such as this. I may add that the outlook for the year ahead is bright indeed. 

Taking into account all the foreseeable risks, it is likely that the net earnings of these companies in 1956 

will approximate $1,000,000, or a return of better than 10 per cent.

Highways and Roads 
 

In the face of the changing complexion of the Saskatchewan economy, and the changing technology of 

the day, one of the most challenging jobs the Province faces is the provision of adequate roads. For 

1956-57, gross expenditure by the Province on highways and roads, inclusive of federal Trans-Canada 

funds will reach $28,360,000. On a net basis, the budget increases the vote to the Highways Department 

by $1,350,000, providing $7,725,000 on revenue account and $12,000,000 on capital. It also contains 

the first instalment of the Province’s share of the $50,000,000 market road system. In providing for this 

program, the Legislature will be voting a total of $2,325,000 for assistance for municipal roads, bridges 

and ferries. I should point out, too, that this amount will increase in future years. The road grid plan calls 

for an average annual contribution by the Province of $2,500,000 for ten years. In consultation with 

municipalities, 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

20 

 

however, it was agreed that in the first year not more than $1,000,000 of the Province’s contribution 

could be spent. As the construction program gets properly underway, the grant from the Province may 

be expected to rise about the $2,500,000 level annually. 

 

This will be, by far, the largest road building program ever undertaken in Saskatchewan. Large as it is, 

we recognise fully that it still falls short of meeting the tremendous need. Nevertheless, we are pushing 

our resources to the limit in the endeavour to provide a steadily improving transportation system. Every 

cent of user taxes – and much more besides – is being devoted to this end. 

 

In 1956-57 close to $25,000,000 of provincial funds will be spent on roads, highway safety and 

associated requirements. In contrast we estimate that only $20,000,000 will be received in gasoline tax 

and motor vehicle registration fees. 

 

The expenditures are these:  

Highways (net)................... $19,725,000 

Municipal roads and bridges.............. 2,325,000 

Interest and sinking fund payments  

on highway debt.................. 2,076,860 

Administration of the Highway Traffic Board....... 279,150 

Administration of The Vehicles Act........... 366,680 

Administration of The Gasoline Act........... 170,230 

  

Total:..................... $24,942,920 

  

The revenues are:  

Gasoline tax.................... $14,500,000 

Motor vehicle fees and licenses............. 5,700,000 

 $20,200,000 

 

Those who would criticize the adequacy of Saskatchewan’s highway system by comparing it 

unreasonably with facilities available in densely populated areas would do well to remember not only 

the huge mileages required in our sparsely populated province, but also that we are spending beyond the 

resources being made available by those who use the roads. 

 

Public Buildings 

 

This, Mr. Speaker, is a thumbnail sketch of what is contained in the 1956-57 budget as presented to the 

Legislative Assembly today. It is a budget founded on confidence in our future, and characterized by the 

diversity for which Saskatchewan has become known. The budget for public buildings alone provides 

evidence of the scope and balance of our program; a University Library will be completed, and a 

women’s jail will be started; a 300-bed nursing home will be completed, and work on a Research 

Council Building will commence. There is provision for a fish hatchery on the Qu'Appelle Lakes, for a 

start on a new court house in Saskatoon, the beginning of a new building in Regina to house the 

Department of Public Health, 

  



 

March 5, 1956

and for the continuing reconstruction jobs required at our mental hospitals. 

 

Provincial Aid to Municipalities 
 

The very diversity which characterizes this budget as a provincial budget characterizes the assistance 

bring made available to the municipalities of the province. Honourable Members have heard so much 

lately about what the Government is or is not doing in this field, that it will be worth while to review the 

1956-57 budget from that standpoint. 

 

First it is possible to identify the grants that will be made available to local governments. As I have said, 

grants to local schools will exceed $12,000,000. Aid for regional medical care schemes and municipal 

doctor plans will reach $154,000. Contributions for the construction and operation of local homes for the 

aged will exceed $331,000. The Province will provide two-thirds of the cost of preventative health 

services in health regions, at a cost of $560,000. The grant for market roads, including the grid system 

and equalization payments, will equal $1,500,000. This direct aid totals some $14,500,000 for 1956-57. 

By contrast, in 1943-44, similar grants amounted to less than $3,000,000. 

 

In loans to local governments in 1956-57, we shall also make available close to $1,700,000, including 

$1,000,000 in school debentures, $400,000 for direct loans to school units and school districts, and up to 

$250,000 for the construction of hospitals. As I announced in 1954, we are also prepared to purchase a 

reasonable percentage of debentures issued by municipal governments for the purpose of financing self-

liquidating projects. 

 

It is also possible to measure in part the financial significance of revenue sources made available to the 

municipalities since 1944. The abolition of the public revenue tax in 1953 has provided them with as 

potential income of $1,800,000. Payments in lieu of taxes to municipalities by Crown Corporations will 

approximate $185,000, not including payments by the Power Corporation to certain cities where the 

Corporation is responsible for the distribution of power. Urban authorities have also been able to take 

advantage of the amusement tax, a levy which yielded $430,000 in 1954, and one which is still retained 

by provincial governments in nearly every other province. 

 

In addition to direct assistance to municipalities, the Province is providing many services formerly being 

borne either by the municipalities, or directly by citizens themselves. Honourable Members will be fully 

aware of the provision in this budget of nearly $6,000,000 of revenues from general funds for the 

operation of the Hospital Services Plan. In 1956-57, the provision of medical services for public 

assistance recipients totals nearly $1,430,000 more than was the case twelve years ago. Free medical and 

hospital care for the mentally ill will cost next year almost $7 ¼ million, in contrast to less than 

$1,420,000 provided by the Provincial Government of 1943-44. Free cancer treatment will involve the 

Province in expenditures of close to $990,000 and the grant of $2.00 per patient day to tuberculosis 

sanatoria, instead of the $1.00 per

day formerly provided, will require a total of $540,000. Finally, in 1956-57 public assistance payments 

will exceed those being made in 1943-44 by $3,304,000. Over the corresponding period, municipalities 

have been obliged to raise total social aid payments by only $400,000. 

 

All of these measures, and many others such as the conservation program of the Department of 

Agriculture and the cancellation of seed grain and relief debts, have combined to bolster the ability of 

local governments to meet their responsibilities. Nevertheless, I am the first to recognize that the cost of 

many local services is rising faster than the property tax base. As a result, there are many problems of 

local finance to which hundreds of municipal men are giving devoted attention. I want to assure them 

that this Government will continue in the future, as in the past, to seek out the best ways and means to 

come to their aid in the basic job of preserving strong local government. 

 

Financing Public Services 

 

No one can deny, Mr. Speaker, that over the past twelve years Saskatchewan has taken remarkable 

strides forward, not only in the broadening of its economic foundations, but also in the development of 

the highest standards of social services. With a 10 per cent increase in estimates, the budget proposes a 

further remarkable advance in 1956-57. It will be accomplished, all Honourable Members will be glad to 

know, with no new taxes and with no increases in existing taxes. 

 

Because our record of achievement speaks for itself, because it is recognized at its true value by the 

people of the Province, critics of the Government are forced to take refuge in charges of burdensome tax 

increases and reckless extravagance. What substance is there to charges such as these? 

 

There have been a number of minor adjustments in licenses and administrative fees, but these have been 

neither general nor significant in revenue terms. In the case of the Education and Hospitalization Tax, 

one of the first acts of the present Government was to effect a very significant reduction in its burden by 

exempting all foodstuffs and drugs. The later increase to a 3 per cent rate did no more than to restore the 

yield of the tax to the same level as would have been provided by the 2 per cent levy without the 

exemptions. The actual weight of the gasoline tax has been increased by only 1 cent, since 3 cents was 

assumed by the Province from the Federal Government as a part of the revised federal-provincial tax 

arrangement after the war. The only new levy has been the per capita assessment for Hospital insurance, 

which is earmarked for a specific service, valued in its own right, I am sure, by every Saskatchewan 

citizen. So much, then, for the accusation of burdensome tax increases. 

 

Has there been reckless extravagance? Has it been of the type so glibly promised by spokesmen for the 

Opposition? Again the facts are plain. Never before in our history has the Province paid its way so well 

as it went, and at the same time paid off the heavy debts incurred in earlier decades. In twelve years, the 

net debt has been reduced by 

  



 

March 5, 1956 

23 
 

$107,000,000, and on a per capita basis it now stands among the lowest of the provinces of Canada. Nor 

have extensive capital programs and debt management policies been carried out without careful thought 

to the future. We are now setting aside in sinking funds every year 3 per cent of the gross funded debt, 

and are voting $4,000,000 annually for debt reduction. In twelve years the credit rating of the Province 

of Saskatchewan has been raised from oblivion to where it is recognized today in the New York market 

as the equal of the large provinces of Ontario and Quebec. So much for the cry of extravagance! 

 

How then has it been possible to carry forward the broad programs of economic development and social 

advance reflected in the budget today? Certainly not by any financial magic of the Provincial Treasurer. 

The answer lies in the productive work and effort of the people of the province, and in the good fortune 

bestowed upon us by a beneficent Province. Both directly and indirectly, the remarkable growth in our 

production, resources and income in the past decade has swelled the tide of revenue flowing into the 

public treasury. It has been the task of the Government to assist that growth, and to use the resultant 

revenues for the greatest good of the greatest number. We have tried to do that job honestly, 

intelligently, imaginatively. In due course, the people of Saskatchewan will judge the measure of our 

success.
