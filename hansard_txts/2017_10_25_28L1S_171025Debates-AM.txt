 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 2583 
 October 25, 2017 
 
[The Assembly met at 10:00.] 
 
[Prayers] 
 

ANNOUNCEMENTS 
 

Vacancies in Saskatoon Fairview and Kindersley 
Constituencies 

 
The Speaker: — It is my duty to inform the Assembly of the 
following vacancies: the constituency of Saskatoon Fairview 
due to the resignation of Ms. Jennifer Campeau, and the 
constituency of Kindersley due to the resignation of Mr. Bill 
Boyd. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF NEW MEMBER OF THE 
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY 

 
The Speaker: — I hereby inform the Assembly that the Clerk 
of the Legislative Assembly has received from the Chief 
Electoral Officer, a certificate of the election and return of 
Vicki Mowat as the member for the constituency of Saskatoon 
Fairview. 
 
Ms. Sarauer: — I have the honour to present to you Vicki 
Mowat, member for the constituency of Saskatoon Fairview, 
who has taken the oath and signed the roll and now claims her 
right to take a seat. 
 
The Speaker: — Ms. Mowat, as you take your rightful place in 
this Legislative Assembly, I’m sure that your time here will be 
one that serves as a record of honour to yourself and your 
constituents. Welcome to the Legislative Assembly. Let the 
hon. member take her seat. 
 
I am advised that Her Honour is here for prorogation. 
 

PROROGATION 
 
[At 10:04 Her Honour the Lieutenant Governor entered the 
Chamber and took her seat upon the Throne. Her Honour was 
then pleased to deliver the following speech.] 
 
Her Honour: — Pray be seated. 
 
Mr. Speaker, members of the Legislative Assembly, people of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
The Speech from the Throne that opened the Twenty-Eighth 
Legislature presented a plan to keep Saskatchewan strong and 
reaffirm my government’s commitment to continued growth 
and prosperity for all in Saskatchewan. 
 
Since the First Session of the Twenty-Eighth Legislature began, 
our province has faced a significant challenge with respect to 
non-renewable resource prices. Since 2014, the revenues 
received from our province’s resource sector have declined by 
$1.3 billion. In this session, my government chose to meet this 
challenge head-on. 
 
While some other governments have chosen to continue 
running deficits indefinitely, my government chose to take a 

different approach. 
 
To secure Saskatchewan’s future, difficult decisions had to be 
made to ensure economic growth and reduce the province’s 
dependence on resource revenues while ensuring important 
services and programs are sustainable in the long run. 
 
My government set a goal to return the budget to balance in 
three years, and we are on track to meet that commitment. 
 
My government remains committed to creating an environment 
that fosters innovation, attracts investment and people, and 
encourages growth. 
 
As a result of this budget, Saskatchewan individuals and 
families will pay among the lowest income taxes in Canada — 
ranging from the lowest to the third-lowest for most, depending 
on level of income. 
 
When the tax changes announced in this budget are fully 
implemented, Saskatchewan will have the lowest taxes on 
manufacturing and processing, and nation-leading research and 
development incentives, giving our province a tremendous 
advantage in attracting new investments, jobs, and opportunities 
in Saskatchewan. 
 
Over the past decade my government has made record 
infrastructure investments. My government has invested $26 
billion to repair and replace schools, rebuild our hospitals, fix 
our highways, and upgrade and expand our electrical grids. 
 
This fall, Saskatchewan’s largest education capital project was 
completed on time and on budget. Students in our fastest 
growing communities of Regina, Saskatoon, Warman and 
Martensville have started this school year in 18 brand new 
schools. Work continues on the Jim Pattison Children’s 
Hospital, the Saskatchewan Hospital North Battleford, and on 
the Regina Bypass – the largest infrastructure project in the 
history of Saskatchewan. 
 
During this session, my government reaffirmed our 
commitment to keep Saskatchewan strong, fulfilling promises 
we made in 2016 by: 
 
• Allowing employees more time to care for loved ones and 

family members by extending compassionate care leave 
from eight weeks to 28 weeks; 

 
• Providing Saskatchewan people the option to privately pay 

for a CT scan; 
 
• Fulfilling our commitment to increase funding for the 

Canadian National Institute for the Blind and provide post 
vision loss rehabilitation therapy; and 

 
• Providing better health care services in the north by 

expanding remote presence medical technology to 
additional communities in northern Saskatchewan. 

 
Furthermore, my government passed legislative and regulatory 
changes to improve public safety, to provide better services, to 
protect the most vulnerable, and to strengthen Saskatchewan 



2584 Saskatchewan Hansard October 25, 2017 

through: 
 
• The Provincial Health Authority Act, which creates one 

health authority to better coordinate and streamline health 
services across the province and reduce administrative 
costs; 

 
• The Traffic Safety Amendment Act, which combats 

impaired driving through tougher penalties for impaired 
driving; 

 
• Further amendments to The Traffic Safety Amendment Act, 

including blue lights on tow trucks to increase tow truck 
visibility on highways and making our highways safer for 
roadside assistance workers; 

 
• The Victims of Interpersonal Violence Amendment Act, 

which provides greater protection to victims of domestic 
violence by allowing them to end rental leases early if 
necessary to remove themselves from an unsafe situation; 

 
• The Pipelines Amendment Act, which strengthens 

regulatory requirements for pipelines to improve pipeline 
safety; 

 
• The Saskatchewan Commercial Innovation Incentive Act, 

which encourages investment through the creation of the 
first “patent box” incentive in North America; 

 
• The Workers’ Compensation Amendment Act, which 

establishes a rebuttal presumption for all forms of 
psychological injury; and 

 
• The Adoption Amendment Act, which strengthens The 

Adoption Act to better serve families, provide improved 
protection to children, and enhance child welfare. 

 
These are just a few of the many changes my government has 
implemented to improve the quality of life for Saskatchewan 
people and secure future growth for the province. 
 
Members of the Legislative Assembly, it is my duty to 
discharge you from further attendance of the first session of the 
Twenty-Eighth Legislature. In closing, I wish to thank all 
members of the assembly for your hard work and the 
commitment you have shown to your duties in this chamber and 
to your constituents. 
 
Hon. Ms. Wilson: — Mr. Speaker and members of the 
Legislative Assembly, it is the will and the pleasure of Her 
Honour the Lieutenant Governor that this Legislative Assembly 
be prorogued until later today, the 25th of October, 2017 at 
2 p.m. This Legislative Assembly is accordingly prorogued. 
 
[Her Honour retired from the Chamber at 10:12.]
