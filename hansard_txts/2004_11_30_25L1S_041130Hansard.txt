Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I have a petition to present 
regarding a public inquiry into SPUDCO (Saskatchewan Potato

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I too 
would like to join the member opposite in welcoming the 
committee here today. We had a very productive meeting over 
lunch, and I think that they’re doing very good work. And so I 
ask us all to give them a warm welcome. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to join 
with the member from Biggar and the Minister of the 
Environment on welcoming our guests. And in particular, Ron 
and Marj Stevens were formerly constituents from the 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1977 

Kindersley area. And I welcome them to their legislature. 
They’re missed at home but we wish them all the best wishes in 
their relocation in the Vanscoy area. 
 
And while I’m on my feet, Mr. Speaker, on the floor of the 
Assembly today we have with us Mr. Jeremy Morgan, as well 
as the artist, Roger Jerome, and I’m sure we’re going to hear 
more from a ministerial statement later. But I would ask that all 
members welcome these individuals to their Assembly as well. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cumberland. 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the 
Assembly to join me in welcoming Roger Jerome who is from 
Air Ronge, who is here with us today along with his wife, Flora, 
and granddaughter. Flora is up there. 
 
And accompanying Roger is Jeremy Morgan, executive director 
of the Saskatchewan Arts Board. And Roger was chosen by the 
arts board to create a new mural in the Legislative Building as a 
part of Saskatchewan’s centennial project, and I’ll be making a 
ministerial statement later on this afternoon about that. 
 
Also, Mr. Speaker, while I’m on my feet, I’m also very pleased 
to introduce Gabriella Martinelli, president of the Capri Films, 
who is currently co-producing Terry Gilliam’s feature film 
Tideland, shot on location in Saskatchewan, and her assistant, 
Jason Shabatoski. Also accompanying Ms. Martinelli is 
Susanne Bell, director of programs and services at SaskFILM, 
and Rhonda Baker, an independent Saskatchewan film 
producer, who is the line producer of Tideland. I would ask all 
members to welcome these guests to the Chamber today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to 
you and through you to the members of the Assembly, I’d like 
to introduce a couple of people in your gallery that are board 
members of the Saskatchewan Aerial Applicators Association, 
known as the SAAA. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we’ll be joined by more members later on this 
afternoon, but right now I’d like to introduce Jim Wood and 
Michael Yaholnitsky, who are board members of the SAAA. 
And I would ask all members to please welcome them to their 
Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Well thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. I was beginning to wonder what one had to do to get 
noticed here. But I just want to . . . I just want to welcome a 
school group to the Legislative Assembly today. And I have to 
tell you people that are here that they don’t always behave this 
way. But this is like the last day of school because this is the 
last day of the sitting of this session, so you’ll have to be a little 
bit patient with them. 

We have, Mr. Speaker, 19 students from St. Josaphat School in 
Regina Rosemont. They’re with their teacher today, Dean 
Benko, intern Chelsea Romanyk, aide Nicole Williams. And I 
know that we’re scheduled to have a photograph because we 
want to record this visit. And as well we’re going to have a little 
visit from 2:30 to 3:00, and I look forward to speaking with 
them. And thank you very much for coming to the legislature 
today. Would everyone join me in welcoming them. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to 
you and through you to the rest of the Assembly, I’d like to 
introduce a constituent of mine who is sitting behind the bar on 
the opposite side of the House, the former member from 
Melville, Mr. Ron Osika. 
 
Mr. Osika spent four years on this side of the House as a 
Liberal, as many would know, and he spent a year in the Chair 
where you’re sitting, Mr. Speaker, and then he spent three more 
years on the government side. 
 
I think his opportunity to further his career in politics was more 
successful when he was sitting on this side of the House, Mr. 
Speaker, than sitting on that side of the House. But seeing as he 
only spent three years on that side of the House and he’s sitting 
on that side of the House right now, we’d invite him to sit 
behind the bar on this side of the House because, Mr. Speaker, I 
am looking for another lawn sign location in the next general 
election. 
 
So I’d like all members to welcome Mr. Osika back to the 
Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
want to join my colleague in recognizing Mr. Osika. As we all 
know, Mr. Osika served with great distinction in this Assembly. 
And again, I’ve known Ron for a number of years, and he 
became a very close friend and a dear colleague and certainly 
has contributed a great amount to the people of Saskatchewan. I 
want to commend him publicly for that. 
 
But I also want to point out in my closing comment that Mr. 
Osika’s seen service from this side of the House which 28 of 
those guys on the other side will never see, Mr. Speaker. So the 
view from this area is tremendous, and I’m sure Mr. Osika in 
his past role appreciated that, and he’ll continue working very 
hard. And I think, Mr. Speaker, I think he will be back. Thank 
you very much. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 
Coronation Park. 



1978 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2004 

Tommy Douglas Named the Greatest Canadian 
 
Mr. Trew: — Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t be prouder or happier. 
I’m proud of CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) for 
making The Greatest Canadian happen. I’m even prouder of 
Canadians who rose to the challenge by thinking out what it is 
to be Canadian, then debating with passion what it takes to be a 
great Canadian. 
 
The field of nominees started at 100 and, Mr. Speaker, I say two 
things. First, all 100 nominees make us proud Canadians. And 
second, these 100 nominees were distilled from literally 
thousands of worthy Canadians, past and present. Our nation 
has much to celebrate. 
 
As with any contest, one is honoured above all others. Canada’s 
official greatest Canadian is none other than Tommy Douglas. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Trew: — Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that he should be. More 
than anything else, Tommy’s life work, medicare, defines what 
makes us unique in the North American context. The number 
one thing cited by Canadians as making us distinctly Canadian 
is medicare. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Tommy Douglas was a man of vision, courage, 
compassion, honesty, and humour who will always be 
remembered as a man who inspired we Canadians to become 
more than merely the sum of our parts. Mr. Speaker, I swear I 
can see just over the horizon a new Jerusalem in this, our green 
and pleasant land. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Biggar. 
 

Grandora and Area Water Committee 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to 
commend a group of people from the Grandora area who, 
through their efforts, have brought to the attention of the media 
and the public problems that has arisen from the TransGas 
natural gas storage project being conducted in their area. 
 
TransGas is pumping 6.4 million litres of water from the Tyner 
Valley aquifer each day to flush out four underground salt 
caverns designed to prepare to store reserves of natural gas. 
Since the pumping has begun, residents in the area and outside 
the scope of the project have experienced problems with wells, 
dugouts and spring-fed sloughs. These problems range from 
wells running dry, lower water levels than projected, dirty water 
with taste, odour and colour problems. And more recently, their 
neighbours have been informed about unacceptable levels of 
nitrate and arsenic in their water. 
 
Mr. Speaker, a committee that has been working hard on 
lobbying to have these problems addressed for a number of 
months has, under the insistence by the government, been 
formalized in order to continue to negotiate with the 
government. The Grandora and Area Water Committee consists 
of Mr. Ron Stevens as chairperson, Marj Stevens secretary, 
Dean Diederichs as vice-chairman, and Shelly Sarvas as 

treasurer. 
 
The committee and residents of Vanscoy, Grandora, and 
Asquith area deserve a great deal of credit forcing the NDP 
(New Democratic Party) government to begin to address the 
water concerns, but also exposing the deplorable state of the 
rural water supply. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 

Provincial 4A Championships 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On November 
20, the Oxbow Prairie Heights Black Knights senior boys 4A 
volleyball team won the provincial 4A championship which 
was played in Unity and Wilkie. 
 
This championship is the result of hard work and dedication by 
the players and excellent coaching by Coach Cal Rosenthal and 
his assistant Bart Mihaliez. The boys practiced or played four 
nights a week and generally had a tournament against a 5A 
team on the weekends. 
 
The provincial boys 4A tournament consisted of 12 teams, three 
each from the four divisions. The Oxbow Black Knights had 
previously faced only 2 of these 12 teams. In the semifinals, 
Oxbow played Melville to advance. The final series was against 
Lumsden, one of the teams which they had previously played. 
The final game scores were Oxbow 25, Lumsden 20; Lumsden 
25, Oxbow 22; Oxbow 25, Lumsden 22 — three very 
hard-fought, exciting games by well-matched teams. 
 
(14:00) 
 
Now if the member for Saskatoon Nutana was a volleyball 
player, she would be telling the opposing teams: stuff happens, 
suck it up, and get over it. However, high school volleyball is 
not that heartless. It’s about sportsmanship and camaraderie, 
with teams cheering each other on and providing support and 
encouragement from the sidelines. Congratulations to the 
Oxbow Black Knights, provincial 4A volleyball champions, and 
congratulations to my son, Kelly, who worked very hard as part 
of the team. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 
 

La Loche Hosts Provincial Volleyball Tournament 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Over the 
weekend I had the opportunity and the privilege to attend the 
provincial 4A volleyball championship tournament held in La 
Loche. I want to commend the Saskatchewan High School 
Athletic Association for choosing La Loche as the site for this 
year’s event. This was the first time a provincial high school 
championship tournament was held in a northern community. 
Mr. Speaker, teams from all over the province came to compete 
for the title of Saskatchewan 4A volleyball champions. Lanigan 
was the overall winner, with Tisdale coming in second and La 
Loche, the host team, coming in third. 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1979 

Mr. Speaker, this was a cross-cultural celebration as much as a 
volleyball tournament. And the people of La Loche can be very 
proud of the exceptional job they did as hosts. The opening 
ceremonies were particularly impressive and served as a 
showcase for First Nations culture. And here are a few of the 
comments, Mr. Speaker, from visiting players and coaches: 
 

Thanks for the great experience! It’s been the best 
provincials I’ve been to in four years. I loved the dancing. 
 

That’s Jessica Kolopenuk from Notre Dame. 
 

I’ve never experienced such outstanding hospitality. 
Everyone’s efforts were amazing. I cherished my time in 
the great North. 
 

Jenny Wilkinson, Tisdale. 
 

Thank you so much for hosting the tournament. The 
people who helped out were super nice and they are great 
cooks. The cultural experience is something I’ll never 
forget. I enjoyed myself thoroughly. 

 
Courtney Kindrat from Tisdale. 
 

Your hospitality and your display of culture were second 
to none. The opening ceremonies were unforgettable. 
Thanks for hosting. 
 

Scott Brinklow, Tisdale coach. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate all the participants of this 
weekend’s tournament, and I particularly want to compliment 
the people of La Loche for doing an outstanding job 
representing the spirit and hospitality of the North. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Humboldt. 
 

Future Plans for Humboldt Hospital 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, St. 
Elizabeth’s Hospital in Humboldt was built in 1955, and it is 
the largest rural hospital in the Saskatoon Regional Health 
Authority. Staffed with dedicated and hard-working 
professionals, St. Elizabeth’s has delivered faith-based, 
high-quality health care services for 49 years now. 
 
Around the facility’s 40th year, structural deterioration and 
deficiencies were becoming increasingly challenging, and in 
1996 a program facility planning committee was established to 
determine how best to address the issues surrounding an aging 
building. They determined that the most cost-efficient proposal 
would be to build an entirely new facility. In 1999 Sask Health 
approved a capital request for a new hospital and appropriate 
professionals were hired to proceed with drafting a plan. Since 
that time, the citizens of Humboldt and area have repeatedly 
been assured by this government that they will receive a new 
hospital but there has never been a commitment as to when that 
new hospital will begin. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to justify the expense of major 

renovations when a new facility has been promised. But as time 
passes, the deterioration increases at an alarming rate. Through 
hard work and phenomenal organizational management, the 
Humboldt citizens and surrounding communities have honoured 
their commitment and they’ve reached their goal of raising 35 
per cent of the funding needed to build a new hospital. Now, 
Mr. Speaker, will the NDP honour their commitment and will 
they keep their promise to Humboldt and community? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Sutherland. 
 

Saskatchewan: A New History 
 
Mr. Addley: — Mr. Speaker, Dr. Bill Waiser is a constituent of 
mine from Saskatoon Sutherland. His list of accomplishments 
as historian, teacher, and writer is long and distinguished. 
 
Dr. Waiser has been a member of the University of 
Saskatchewan history department since 1984, specializing in 
western and northern Canadian history. He’s been department 
head, graduate director, and in 2002 won the College of Arts 
and Science Teaching Excellence Award for the humanities and 
fine arts. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Dr. Waiser is also the author, co-author, or 
co-editor of eight books, mostly having to do with Western 
Canada. These include Loyal till Death: Indians and the 
North-West Rebellion, co-written with Blair Stonechild, as well 
as All Hell Can’t Stop Us: The On-To-Ottawa Trek and Regina 
Riot. 
 
I’m pleased to say, Mr. Speaker, that Dr. Waiser’s latest work is 
a history of Saskatchewan. Coming as it does on the eve of our 
centennial, the timing of this book couldn’t be better. 
Saskatchewan’s history is a unique story of challenge, 
innovation, and change. As we look back over our first 100 
years, it is clear that Saskatchewan has a lot to celebrate and be 
proud of. And equally clear, there are lessons to be learned. Dr. 
Waiser’s book, Saskatchewan: A New History, takes a new 
perspective on traditional topics and looks at subjects that 
before now have escaped attention. 
 
I ask all my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Waiser 
on this latest work. It will remind us of who we are, where we 
came from, and how we got there, which is important to know 
as we chart our course into the second century. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Weyburn-Big 
Muddy. 
 

Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Discovery Well 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this 
Friday, December 3, EnCana will hold a celebration to 
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the discovery well. The 
discovery well on the farm of Robert and Edith Dorsch in the 
Ralph area near Weyburn was drilled and put into production 



1980 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2004 

the fall of 1954. This was the first producing oil well in our 
area. It opened up what has become known as the Weyburn 
field. 
 
Mobil Oil, who owned the lease for where the discovery well 
was located, had given up on finding oil here and so they made 
a deal with two companies, Central-Del Rio and Central Leduc, 
to allow them to drill. And much to everyone’s surprise and 
especially Mobil, they hit oil. At the time of the discovery these 
two companies were on the verge of going broke and actually 
had to pay their staff with shares in the company. 
 
In the late ’60s these two companies formed a merger with 
Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas, became PanCanadian. In 2002, 
PanCanadian merged with Alberta Energy Company to become 
EnCana. 
 
An average well in Saskatchewan produces 20 barrels of oil a 
day. The discovery well began by producing 94 barrels per day. 
The discovery well was abandoned after 39 years of production 
but not before producing 211,834 barrels of oil, enough oil to 
fill 215 grain elevators. 
 
This well was only the beginning, Mr. Speaker. The oil industry 
has been key to the economic viability of Weyburn and 
surrounding area and in turn it’s played a large part in 
enhancing the well-being of our entire province. 
 
I congratulate and thank all those in the oil patch who have, 
through hard work, innovation, and their willingness to be risk 
takers ensured that the oil industry in Saskatchewan has 
endured and prospered. What a great success story. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Food Bank Usage 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The NDP 
government prides itself on being compassionate, so they claim, 
in caring for Saskatchewan families. I remember when Premier 
Romanow ran for election back in ’91, he promised the 
elimination of the need for food banks in the province of 
Saskatchewan. It was the centrepiece of his campaign then. It 
has remained a rallying cry for the NDP in Saskatchewan. 
 
Last week though, Mr. Speaker, Campaign 2000 released its 
report on child poverty. It said there were 44,000 children who 
live in poverty in Saskatchewan. That’s 2,000 more than the 
year before. To the minister responsible, why is child poverty 
on the rise in the province of Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Community 
Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Certainly we’re always concerned about families who are living 
in poverty. But I have to say that ever since we instituted 

Building Independence in 1997, we’ve seen a steady decline in 
the depth of poverty in Saskatchewan, ever since 1993. 
 
I want to mention that Saskatchewan has the lowest rate of 
poverty in Canada for children living in two-parent families, 
and the third-lowest rate for children living in lone-female 
families. And we did have the second-lowest depth of poverty 
in Canada, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the principle, 
certainly, of what the minister is saying simply isn’t true here in 
the province of Saskatchewan. In fact, there aren’t a lot of 
growth industries in the province of Saskatchewan under the 
NDP. Unfortunately, though, one of them is food banks. 
 
The number of food banks have increased across this province 
since this government was elected. This is now a rural and an 
urban problem. And the members heckle, Mr. Speaker. The 
NDP members heckle. 
 
Here’s what the Canadian Association of Food Banks say about 
what’s happening in the province. They highlight that the 
second highest growth rate in food bank usage this year is 
occurring where, Mr. Speaker? It’s occurring in the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
In a letter to the minister dated November 23, the head of the 
Saskatoon Food Bank wonders how we can go 24 years without 
any meaningful increase in the food allowance. He raises the 
concerns of the hungry in his letter, Mr. Speaker. 
 
One in five food bank clients say they are referred to the food 
bank by the minister’s own officials, Mr. Speaker. What is the 
minister’s plan to deal with the fact that the second highest 
growing province in Canada in terms of food bank usage is 
right here in NDP Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Community 
Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
One of the things I would say to the members opposite, Mr. 
Speaker, is that we have actually had the income of a single 
parent, low-income, working, single parent on assistance, 
improve by $6,000 over the last few years. And that’s because 
we’ve included a number of supports which aren’t reflected in 
the basic welfare rate. 
 
The Campaign 2000 mentions that it’s a multi-faceted problem 
that includes housing, child care, health care, employment 
supports. We have added all of those programs to support both 
individuals on and off social assistance, and unfortunately these 
reports don’t count those other things in their statistics. But we 
are doing exactly what Campaign 2000 recommended, and I 
think we’re going to see even bigger improvements when the 
housing allowance that we’ve committed to is implemented in 
April 2005. 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1981 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, food bank usage in the province of 
Saskatchewan is second highest in the country; it’s on the rise 
in the province. There are food banks opening in rural and the 
need for the food banks in urban Saskatchewan is being 
exacerbated. 
 
Former NDP cabinet minister Bob Pringle is now the executive 
director of the Saskatoon Food Bank. He is not afraid to speak 
frankly to this government or to the opposition, to whomever 
will hear. And here’s what he said in a recent interview, and I 
quote: 
 

I’ll just say it the way it is. We’ve had more interest by the 
opposition in these issues than by the government. 
 

To which the minister replied: 
 

The Premier was the minister of Social Services. I doubt 
there’s very much about this that he doesn’t understand. 

 
Mr. Speaker, then to the minister: would she tell the members 
of this Legislative Assembly — and most importantly, those 
who need to use food banks, those who are in poverty in the 
province of Saskatchewan — how understanding helps them at 
all? That whether or not the Premier understands the issue is 
irrelevant. What is this NDP government doing about the 
problem? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Community 
Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — I want to reiterate that nobody wants to 
make progress on this issue any more than myself and we are 
meeting regularly with food banks, food security programs, 
poverty organizations. And certainly, as we have in every 
budget over the last several years, we’ll be bringing forward 
new improvements. And we’ve done that a great deal in the area 
of people with disabilities as well. 
 
But I want to just remind the member opposite, while he’s busy 
pontificating there, that in 1999 when he was talking about how 
he was going to achieve tax breaks, he committed to chopping 
50 million off the spending of the Social Service department. 
And I would like to know where exactly he would be getting 
that 50 million from. 
 
As well, the people who were involved in doing these 
assessments cite the minimum wage as one of the issues and I’d 
like to know the member opposite’s view on that as well. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 

Fire Suppression Fleet 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 

this NDP government spent over $1 million exploring options 
for replacing its forest firefighting fleet. And other than some 
consultant’s report and two trips to Australia, it seems all ideas 
were abandoned except the one that they started with. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the former minister responsible for Crown 
Investments Corporation: other than his souvenir Crocodile 
Dundee hat, can he tell us what he learned about firefighting 
aircraft during his trip to Australia? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Crown 
Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Approximately four years ago, the Department of the 
Environment began exploring funding models for supporting a 
reinvestment in Saskatchewan’s fire suppression fleet. 
 
The Department of the Environment explored a number of 
options including leasing, purchasing new planes, and also the 
possibility of public-private partnerships. They asked the 
Crown Investments Corporation to examine the possibility of 
P3s as the solution for their fire fleet planes. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as part of CIC’s (Crown Investments Corporation 
of Saskatchewan) examination, they looked at a number of 
issues including how could we deploy these planes to make this 
P3 commercially viable in the off-season, Mr. Speaker. And 
obviously we looked to Australia because their fire season is in 
opposition to ours, or at the opposite end. So, Mr. Speaker, 
what we tried to do was to ensure that this idea of a P3 was 
commercially viable, and in order to have a commercially 
viable solution you needed to deploy those planes during all the 
seasons. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(14:15) 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Speaker, according to the 
Minister of the Environment, he says the CIC investigation 
discovered two very, very interesting things. One is Australia is 
a long way from Saskatchewan. The second is Australia uses a 
different kind of an aircraft. Mr. Speaker, to the Minister 
responsible for CIC, why didn’t she give her officials a map and 
a telephone to find out exactly the same thing that the Minister 
of the Environment discovered. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Crown 
Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
over the course of the P3 development when CIC was pursuing 
the option of a private-public partnership, Bombardier, which is 
an important aircraft industry in this country, relaunched its 
capability to add turbine engines to its previously released 
planes. Mr. Speaker, this meant that Saskatchewan 
Environment could save approximately $100 million over the 
life of the project. 



1982 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2004 

And, Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day we decided to pursue an 
option that involves the relaunching of these piston planes 
because Bombardier could retool them and that, at the end of 
the day, saves the taxpayers’ money. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Speaker, this NDP 
government spent more than $1 million for the trips and the 
consultant’s reports. Mr. Speaker, will the minister responsible 
for CIC table all of the documents related to this decision so the 
people of Saskatchewan can determine for themselves if they 
got a fair value for their tax dollars. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Crown 
Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
at the request of the Department of the Environment, CIC did 
its due diligence on the possibility of a private-public 
partnership. Mr. Speaker, as a result of Bombardier deciding to 
relaunch a particular technology where they could put piston 
engines back into these planes, it extended the life of these 
planes by approximately 25 years. Mr. Speaker, we saved $100 
million over the life of the project. 
 
Now the members of the opposition or is it the flopposition — I 
can’t quite remember — they may not quite understand the 
notion of $100 million in real savings, Mr. Speaker, but our 
government does. Because of Bombardier’s technology, it 
allowed us to retool these planes and extend their life for 
approximately 25 years. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
the minister talked about options that were available in 
public-private partnerships. Well one viable option that’s now 
working in New Brunswick, Manitoba, and Alberta, to a 
smaller degree, and in Ontario is the single engine air tanker 
program. This is used for fire suppression, and it’s extremely 
efficient and extremely effective — something that people on 
that side of the House do not understand. 
 
And the minister wishes to talk about saving of dollars. The 
cost of their project is $200 million over the life of the project. 
This is capital dollars that would not have needed to be spent if 
they entered into partnership with the SEAT (single engine air 
tanker) program. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of the Environment: was this 
option ever considered? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Yes, 
in fact actually we’ve met with the Aerial Applicators 

Association to discuss this. And they do offer a fine program, 
and it does work in certain areas as the member opposite talked 
about. But it didn’t meet the requirements that we have here in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
We have greater distance to fly. The new configuration of what 
we’re talking about has a greater load capacity, greater speed 
capacity. But we continue to discuss with these folks, and as 
well, there’s great work for them. I understand that some have 
actually entered into agreements with certain RMs (rural 
municipality) about this, along the forest fringe — a very 
important area along that area for them to be involved in. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 

SaskTel Investment in Navigata 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — The NDP government has invested $60 
million today in a BC (British Columbia) telecommunications 
company called Navigata. In its first three years since the 
government bought this company, Navigata has lost just over 
$25 million. 
 
To the minister: is Navigata expected to show a profit or a loss 
this year, and how much is that profit or loss expected to be? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister Responsible for 
Saskatchewan Telecommunications. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well in case the members are unaware, Navigata first of all is 
being used as a vehicle, if you will, to get into the markets, into 
Alberta and British Columbia. The Voice over Internet Protocol 
— if you’ll listen, Mr. Speaker — the Voice over Internet 
Protocol is clearly going to be, I think, most 
telecommunications companies will say, will be the way of the 
future. 
 
I think, first of all, it would be the view of SaskTel, Mr. 
Speaker, that the research and development needs to take place. 
You need to find the marketplaces, Mr. Speaker. And, Mr. 
Speaker, it would be the view as well of SaskTel that this is a 
very worthwhile investment. It wasn’t expected to make money 
in the first few years, Mr. Speaker. Every other telephone 
company in North America, in the world, Mr. Speaker, is 
putting large amounts of money into research and development 
in this very area, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well the 
government certainly is putting large amounts of monies, but 
it’s interesting to note that the Voice over Internet that they’re 
talking about is taking place in BC and Alberta, not in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, on page 19 of SaskTel’s 2003 annual report it 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1983 

says, and I quote: “Navigata . . . is expected to start generating a 
profit in 2004.” Is that true? Does the minister expect Navigata 
to turn a profit this year? Or is there going to be a continuation 
of its money-losing record? How much do we expect to either 
profit or lose, Mr. Minister? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for SaskTel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I’ll answer the 
question again. I’ll answer the question, Mr. Speaker, but let me 
make this point first. 
 
I find it passing strange, you know, that they used to ask 
questions about Austar, Mr. Speaker. They used to ask 
questions about Austar. Isn’t it interesting? When they wanted 
us to sell it and we said we shouldn’t, we should maintain the 
ownership in that investment, Mr. Speaker, if we’d have sold it 
when they wanted us to sell it, Mr. Speaker, there would have 
been a loss, Mr. Speaker, albeit it would have been a small loss 
at the time but there would have been a loss. Interesting, it’s 
now been sold, Mr. Speaker, those shares, and we now see a 
profit for the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — So I think, I think, Mr. Speaker, we 
should, we should respect the experts in the area. We should 
respect the experts in the area who say that this is an area where 
much research and development needs yet to take place. Every 
telephone company in the world says that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the investment, they will know from reading the 
annual reports, is about $60 million. The losses so far have been 
about 25 million and, Mr. Speaker, the savings to the parent 
company have been roughly 10 million so far. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The minister 
talks about Austar, another NDP success story — they didn’t 
lose as much money as they could have. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, the NDPs originally spent 
45 million of taxpayers’ dollars on Navigata. Earlier this year 
they injected another 15 million taxpayers’ dollars into this 
company. That’s the $60 million that the Minister of 
Agriculture was talking about that he couldn’t find for CAIS 
(Canadian agricultural income stabilization) program, Mr. 
Speaker. Does the minister expect the government to have to 
inject more money into Navigata, or is he ruling out putting any 
more money into this failing operation? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for SaskTel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Well, Mr. Speaker, it feels like nothing 

has changed here. You know, several days ago they voted in 
support of public ownership and now they stand and they 
criticize, Mr. Speaker. They criticize continually. 
 
Mr. Speaker, can they hold any position consistently? It is clear 
that every telephone company, Mr. Speaker, in North America, 
in the world, believes that this is the area that telephone 
companies need to do research and development, where this is 
the marketplace in the future for telephone companies, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
SaskTel is exactly the same. They’ve led in many areas, they’ve 
led the world in their research and development — led the 
world. And we have proven, SaskTel has proven many times 
that they have made the right investments, contrary to what the 
opposition continually says, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Saskatchewan Potato Utility Development Company 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, two weeks is not a very long 
session by anyone’s measure. But it is plenty of time for the 
people of the province to realize that this government has 
learned precisely nothing. 
 
They’ve learned nothing from the last election. They’ve learned 
nothing from the myriad of mistakes they’ve made. They’ve 
learned nothing from the fact, Mr. Speaker, that they seem to be 
able to talk the talk when it comes to feeding the hungry or 
when it comes to reducing waiting lists, but their actions speak 
louder than their words, and their actions are woefully 
inadequate. 
 
The session began with the people of Saskatchewan and the 
opposition for the province of Saskatchewan asking for a public 
inquiry into the largest government business scandal in the 
history of Saskatchewan — SPUDCO, Mr. Speaker — 10 times 
bigger than the federal sponsorship scandal. 
 
In light of all the unanswered questions and the unwillingness 
of the NDP to come clean on this scandal, Mr. Speaker, I ask 
anyone over there frankly if they yet have found the courage to 
do the right thing and have a public inquiry into the SPUDCO 
scandal. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for SaskWater. 
 
Hon. Mr. Prebble: — Well thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
It has indeed been 12 important days of debate. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the member of the 
opposition what he said on October 20 in John Gormley. He 
said there were three major reasons why there should be a 
public inquiry. First he said, Mr. Speaker, because the 
Government of Saskatchewan, he claimed, had spent money 
without lawful authority. And we’ve demonstrated in this 
legislature very clearly, backed up by the Provincial Auditor 
and by private auditors as well, Mr. Speaker, that this 



1984 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2004 

government has acted lawfully. 
 
Secondly, Mr. Speaker, he claimed on John Gormley on 
October 20 that the government had failed to meet its 
obligations with respect to Ducks Unlimited and 
Rafferty-Alameda. And we demonstrated clearly, Mr. Speaker, 
in this legislature, that the obligation to Ducks Unlimited and to 
Rafferty-Alameda have been met in full, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, there are no answers 
on those issues coming forward from this government. In fact 
the latest development in SPUDCO was the need for that 
minister to apologize for that Deputy Premier and that Premier 
for manipulating the courts of Saskatchewan with 
taxpayer-funded lawyers, for their own political benefit. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — And still the Deputy Premier sits there without 
any discipline, without any punishment. The Premier is silent 
on the issue. And the minister is proud, Mr. Speaker. 
 

Economy of the Province 
 
Mr. Wall: — We also know, Mr. Speaker, we also know after 
this two-week session that the NDP government now has almost 
$1 billion dollars that they didn’t budget for. We know that they 
refuse to fund their share of CAIS up to and including this day 
because they said they were broke, Mr. Speaker. We have 
one-time hurt in the agriculture community in rural 
Saskatchewan; the NDP has one-time money. Do they have a 
thin dime of it for rural Saskatchewan? The answer is no. 
 
The question to the Minister of Agriculture is this: has he 
learned his lesson from this session — will the NDP keep their 
commitment to CAIS in rural Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Well, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, this 
agenda this session was about identifying who it is in 
Saskatchewan that could govern, Mr. Speaker. And this session, 
Mr. Speaker, was to examine what it is that the opposition could 
do and what this government is doing, Mr. Speaker. 
 
This agenda, Mr. Speaker, in this session was to advise 
Saskatchewan people of how it is we’re building the economy. 
And how are we doing it, Mr. Speaker? We found additional 
money, Mr. Speaker, in health care, Mr. Speaker. We built the 
new . . . found additional money for equalization, Mr. Speaker, 
for the people of Saskatchewan. And, Mr. Speaker, we changed 
the oil revenues . . . oil royalties in this province so that, Mr. 
Speaker, we could get a better benefit for Saskatchewan people. 
 
And the opposition, Mr. Speaker, had an opportunity to talk 
about their Enterprise Saskatchewan. And did they talk about 
Enterprise Saskatchewan? Not one word for two weeks about 

Enterprise Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. Did they talk about how 
they’re going to grow the economy? Not at all, Mr. Speaker. 
Instead, Mr. Speaker, they began a character assassination on 
the public service, on the government of . . . on previous 
government members — that’s what they did. 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the member’s time truly has 
elapsed, Mr. Speaker. Two weeks is not a long session, but it is 
more than enough time for the people of this province to see 
that this is an NDP government that can monitor waiting lists in 
health care but they have no plan to deal with them. Two weeks 
is long enough for the people of the province to see that this is a 
government that can say that it’s concerned about the hungry, 
but there’s no action to feed the hungry, Mr. Speaker. Two 
weeks is long enough for the people of the province to see that 
this is an NDP government that says they care about rural 
Saskatchewan and refuses to keep their commitment to the 
CAIS program that they negotiated and signed. And two weeks 
is long enough, Mr. Speaker, for the people of the province to 
see that that Deputy Premier and that NDP government have no 
interest in getting to the truth about SPUDCO. 
 
(14:30) 
 
Mr. Speaker, the question then to the NDP government is pretty 
basic. Why should the people of this great province suffer one 
moment longer under this government that is lacking vision and 
frankly, Mr. Speaker, is more interested in misleading the 
people of Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Mr. Speaker, we want to be on record, Mr. 
Speaker, on this side of the House that we made a promise to 
Saskatchewan people on the lowest priced utility bundles and 
that we’ve . . . (inaudible) . . . We want to be on record for that, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — And we want to be on record on this side 
of the House, Mr. Speaker, that when we needed to fix 
equalization for Saskatchewan people that we fixed equalization 
for Saskatchewan people . . . (inaudible) . . . We want to be on 
record for that. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — And we want the Saskatchewan Leader of 
the Opposition to be on record, Mr. Speaker, when he says 
we’re the most open party in Saskatchewan and that we’re 
going to have open panels and open plenary sessions, and 10 
minutes later, Mr. Speaker, he’s in the rotunda saying I’m sorry 
we’re not going to do that, Mr. Speaker, to flip-flop. 
 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1985 

We want the Leader of the Opposition to be on record where the 
member from Souris-Cannington says we’re going to sell off 
the liquor stores in Saskatchewan, and the member from Maple 
Creek is going to say we’re going to sell off, Mr. Speaker, the 
bus company, and the Leader of the Opposition says you know 
what, no, we’re going to vote for the . . . (inaudible) . . . That’s, 
Mr. Speaker, what this session’s about. You can count on this 
government telling you what the Saskatchewan people are 
going to get. You can’t trust the . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, it won’t be very long before the 
people of Yorkton agree with the Speaker of the Assembly 
when they say the member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order, order. Now I would ask the 
member, I would ask the member to keep the Speaker out of the 
debate. And many members have had the statement of their 
time elapsing. I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Deputy 
Premier talked about rebates, you know this new NDP scheme 
where they’re going to give the taxpayers’ money back to the 
taxpayers; they’re going to give them their money back. You 
know what I think, Mr. Speaker, I think the voters of the 
province of Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan families, they don’t 
want their money back from this government — although fair 
enough this government takes a lot of it — I don’t think they 
want their money back as much as they want their votes back 
from this government, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — When they hear an answer like that from the 
Deputy Premier, when they see their Premier come back from 
Ottawa and say Saskatchewan will always need equalization; 
will always need welfare. That’s what the Premier of the 
province said about the future of Saskatchewan. 
 
This session has highlighted for Saskatchewan people that that 
party is interested only in mediocrity. The official opposition 
will continue to tell the province and tell the rest of the country 
about the great potential of Saskatchewan. If only we could 
change the government, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The question to the Deputy Premier is this: on these issues of 
SPUDCO, and on these issues of CAIS; on these issues of 
keeping faith with the people of the province, when can they 
expect him and his NDP government to keep their word, Mr. 
Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Deputy Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I am reading from an 
article here of Friday, November 12 and the Leader of the 
Opposition says this: 

If someone is trying to decide who to vote for, who to 
support and . . . (where) they go ‘well, my perception is 
. . . this party, the Saskatchewan Party, is a right-wing 
party,’ . . . 
 

Mr. Speaker, is what he says. And then, Mr. Speaker, Mr. 
George Gallagher gets on to his radio station. He says this, Mr. 
Speaker: 
 

Of course we’ve always known what Lorne Calvert and 
his persuasion was about, but (Mr. Speaker) . . . we don’t 
know what the Leader of the Opposition is . . . (Mr. 
Speaker). 

 
And this is from Mr. George Gallagher, one of the most 
significant conservative leader . . . persons in the province. And 
he says, Mr. Brad Wall, we believe at the helm, is yet another 
socialist, Mr. Speaker. And he says that, Mr. Speaker, because 
what we’ve seen from this session is an absolute flip-flop on 
every issue, Mr. Speaker, that comes forward. 
 
And we have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, during this session 
to have the Leader of the Opposition put forward his, his vision, 
for what this province should look like. Instead, Mr. Speaker, 
we don’t see anything from the Leader of the Opposition in 
terms of what their vision should look for. 
 
And I say this, Mr. Speaker, that when the people of 
Saskatchewan vote again the next time, Mr. Speaker, we will 
see the Leader of the Opposition getting his second severance 
package from the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Culture, Youth 
and Recreation. 
 

Artist Chosen for Saskatchewan Centennial Project 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — Mr. Speaker, northern artist Roger Jerome 
has been chosen to create a new mural in the Legislative 
Building as a Saskatchewan Centennial project. This project 
will reflect the lives of indigenous people from northern 
Saskatchewan. 
 
The painting will be installed in the spring of 2005. The 
centennial mural will be a key architectural and artistic 
highlight in the Legislative Building and is an important 
opportunity to present the stories and ways of life of northern 
Saskatchewan First Nations and Métis people. 
 
Roger Jerome is an artist from Air Ronge who has lived in the 
North for most of his life. His subject matter often consists of 
portraits and northern scenes including traditional events. Roger 
and his wife Flora have been married for 38 years. They have a 
son, Robert, who is carrying on the family’s art traditions as a 
carver in traditional media. 
 
The Arts Board was contracted to manage the centennial project 
on behalf of the province of Saskatchewan. The mural is 
expected to be unveiled in May 2005 during the royal visit by 



1986 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2004 

Her Majesty the Queen. 
 
Roger Jerome represents a true example of the creativity and 
imagination of the people of northern Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to respond 
on behalf of the official opposition and thank the minister for 
the ministerial statement she provided to me earlier. 
 
This is a very exciting prospect for this great building in this 
great province. Having art reflecting northern Saskatchewan is 
particularly a good thing because, when we bring people from 
all over the world here, this is art as a medium; our first 
peoples, the Aboriginal persons of this province. It exists 
nowhere else in the world. It is distinctly Canadian. It is 
distinctly something from Saskatchewan, and we should honour 
this and prize it. 
 
And I had a few moments, Mr. Speaker, to speak with the artist 
and Mr. Morgan beforehand and he tells me, it is going to be a 
fantastic piece put forth. 
 
I’ve only been here a few years, but I’ve noticed, throughout the 
halls of the Legislative Assembly, we often have this dull white 
colour. And having art throughout, as we do in some of our 
galleries, it livens up the people’s place of government. This is 
going to be a wonderful centennial project. We commend the 
artist. We know he’s going to do a wonderful job, and we look 
forward to seeing the unveiling in 2005. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the Government House Leader on his 
feet? 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker . . . No, I’ll wait until 
we deal with written questions, Mr. Speaker. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the member for Regina South on his 
feet? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Before orders of the day, I wish to raise a point of order with 
you. 
 
The Speaker: —  . . . the member state his point of order. 
 

POINT OF ORDER 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Thank you very much. Last night, Mr. 
Speaker, the Human Services Committee dealt with 
supplementary estimates for the Department of Learning. 
During the course of the evening, members raised a number of 
questions regarding school board amalgamations. These 
questions were certainly pointed and for the most part were fair 
and thorough. 
 
I do wish however to draw to your attention a set of comments 

raised by the member for Last Mountain-Touchwood 
concerning the individuals serving on the restructuring 
coordinating committee. During the questioning, the member 
for Last Mountain-Touchwood called into question the 
professional ethics of the committee members and ascribed 
personal or parochial gains as motivation for participating in 
this committee. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this committee is comprised of members of the 
senior representatives and educational professionals from the 
school board association, the Saskatchewan Teachers’ 
Federation, the Association of School Business Officials, 
LEADS (League of Educational Administrators, Directors and 
Superintendents of Saskatchewan), the school councils, CUPE 
(Canadian Union of Public Employees), SEIU (Service 
Employees’ International Union). 
 
Mr. Speaker, these comments were inappropriate, unfounded, 
and — I would contend — unparliamentary. I draw to your 
attention Beauchesne’s, 6th Edition, paragraph 493 in which it 
notes, with reference to a member’s parliamentary privilege, 
that: 
 

The Speaker has cautioned Members to exercise great care 
in making statements about persons who are outside the 
House and unable to reply. 

 
Mr. Speaker, the committee members serving on the RCC 
(restructuring coordinating committee) are educational 
professionals and leaders in their sector. They represent their 
diverse memberships and bring to the table professionalism, 
experience, and dedication to education. 
 
To allege that these people are unable or unwilling to act in the 
best interests of the people and organizations they represent and 
that they would somehow use their influence for personal or 
parochial gain is at best inaccurate and at worst defamatory. I 
would ask that you rule if the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood has abused his parliamentary privilege 
and at very less invite him to explain his comments to this 
Assembly and apologize to these educational professionals. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — On the point of order, I recognize the member 
for Indian Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to your 
ruling, but before I go there, I want to point out that is not a 
point of order. That was a speech on an issue that our member 
raised, that he may not have agreed with, which has no 
relevance as far as a point of order. 
 
Our member last night spoke of conversations that he’s had 
with people throughout the education field, and he was relating 
the comments that he heard from those people regarding the 
people that the minister just talked about. It was a debatable 
point relaying the information that he had received through 
constituents and through people in the education field. 
 
Now if that is a point of order where he can stand up and make 
a speech because he disagrees with what our member had said, 
then it throws out the whole issue of point of orders because it 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1987 

was nowhere close to a point of order. He was simply relaying 
the message that he has heard from constituents, people in his 
constituency, and people in the education field, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. At this time I would just like to 
draw to the members’ attention from Beauchesne’s, 6th Edition, 
no. 822, which speaks to: 
 

Procedural difficulties which arise in committees ought to 
be settled in the committee and not in the House. 

 
The point of order . . . Order. Order, please. The procedural 
point of order is regarded as a procedural difficulty, so I find the 
member’s point of order not well-taken. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORDERS OF THE DAY 
 

WRITTEN QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government Whip.

MOTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 

Recess of the Assembly 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order, please. Order, please. 
Order, please. Order, please. Order, please. Order, please. 
Order, order please. Order, please. I have already recognized 
one member in the House, but I’m just trying to bring the House 
to order. I recognize the Government House Leader once again. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, I move: 
 

That this Assembly recess until 10:15 p.m. or until the 
adjournment of the Human Services Committee and the 
Intergovernmental Affairs and Infrastructure Committee 
and that the Speaker shall sound the bells five minutes 
before the expiry of the recess to summon members back 
to the Assembly. 
 

I so move, seconded by the member for Saskatoon Nutana, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for Regina 
Douglas Park, seconded by the member for Saskatoon Nutana: 
 

That this Assembly recess until 10:15 p.m. or until 
adjournment of the Human Services Committee and the 
Intergovernmental Affairs and Infrastructure Committee 
and that the Speaker shall sound the bells five minutes 
before the expiry of the recess to summon members back 
to the Assembly. 
 

Is the Assembly ready for the question? Why is the member on 
his feet? 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Would the member state his point of order. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Distinctly I heard, Mr. Speaker, a member 
of Saskatoon Nutana make an unparliamentary remark to a 
member on this side. It was theriomorphism, Mr. Speaker. The 
member from . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Yes, you can look 
that one up. The member from Nutana distinctly made reference 
to an individual on this side as a dog. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — I do want to withdraw my comments, 
but I was making reference to all members on that side. 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Order, please. Order, please. 
Order, please members. Order, please. Order, please. Order, 
please members. Order. Order. I . . . Order, please. Order, 
please. 
 
I would recognize that . . . I would ask members to recognize 
that the Speaker is not able to hear all of the remarks that go 
across the floor. I notice that the member responded and did 
acknowledge with an apology. Order. And I would ask though 
that whenever any apology is given, it be done unequivocally 
without any other remarks. If the member wishes to do so at this 
time, she may. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, I apologize 
unequivocally. 
 
The Speaker: — Now the question before the Assembly is the 
motion . . . Order. Now the question before the Assembly is a 
motion moved by the member for Regina Douglas Park, 
seconded by the member for Nutana:

GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
 

MOTIONS FOR RETURNS (Debatable) 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 

Return No. 317 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I move that an order of the 
Assembly do issue for a Return No. 317. 

The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast that the Assembly . . . or do we need a 
seconder? Is there a seconder for the motion? 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast, seconded by the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats that an order of the Assembly do issue a 
return no. 317. I recognize the Government Whip. 
 
Mr. Yates: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’m 
extremely pleased today to stand on behalf of the government 
and table an answer for question no. 317. 
 
The Speaker: — I thank the member for his quick response. I 
should put the question before he delivers it. So is the Assembly 
ready for the question. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to 
adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried, and return 317 has 
been submitted. 
 

Return No. 318 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, I’m not sure whether 
a motion is required or whether it suffices for the minister or the 
government to undertake to issue an order for return. If it’s the 
latter, I would just at this point indicate that with respect to 
items 318 through 335 inclusive, that we will undertake to 
provide the information to the Legislative Assembly and the 
people of Saskatchewan. 
 
We would have provided the answers to these very detailed 
questions, Mr. Speaker, if we had been able to find the 
information quicker. I understand that the information which 
should serve to answer the questions has been located. It will 
take us a few days, perhaps a week, to sort through the 
information and to undertake to provide the answers for the 
questions. 
 
I think it should be recognized that the questions that are under 
discussions are questions of great detail, going back a number 
of years, and the information was not readily accessible. But we 
do undertake, Mr. Speaker, to provide this information at a very 
early opportunity. 
 
It doesn’t suit our purposes to not have these questions 
answered. We think it helps the government. We think it helps 
the people of Saskatchewan to have these answers to these 
questions provided at a very early opportunity. And we 
undertake to do so certainly before the rules indicate that such 
answers should be provided. 
 
So if it’s in order, Mr. Speaker, I would undertake on behalf of 
the government to order a return for question 318 through 335 
inclusive. 
 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1993 

The Speaker: — Why is the member from Rosetown-Elrose on 
his feet. 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Mr. Speaker, I move that an order of the 
Assembly do issue for return no. 318, seconded by the member 
for Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
(16:45) 
 
The Speaker: — Thank you. I will accept the motion in a 
moment. I just wanted to clarify to the Assembly that now that 
we’re under motions for returns (debatable) we ought to go 
through all of the motions. But we may be able to expedite it by 
grouping several of them. 
 
It has been moved by the member for Rosetown-Elrose, 
seconded by the member for Kelvington-Wadena that an order 
of the Assembly do issue for return no. 318. Is it the pleasure of 
the Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Motion agreed to. 
 
The Speaker: — Order. I’ve conducted the vote. Did the 
member want to speak to the motion . . . (inaudible interjection) 
. . . I failed to recognize the member at the time, but I’ve 
already declared the vote passed. We’d have to ask for leave if 
the member wishes to speak to the motion. 
 
Is leave granted for the member to speak to this particular 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Rosetown-Elrose. 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the motion on issuing a return for no. 
318, a question that I asked near the beginning of this sitting. 
Mr. Speaker, the questions are concerning the SPUDCO issue 
and normally this question would be answered within five days. 
I had comments from the Government Whip that the answers 
were unable to be found; they had vanished into thin air. And he 
assured me that he would do all that he could to find the 
answers for me before the end of the session. 
 
About a day or so ago, earlier, I believe it was yesterday, the 
Government Whip informed me that they were having trouble 
finding the answers and they were doing the best they could. 
But today he informed me that he thought perhaps they had 
found the answers, but he couldn’t assure me that he had found 
the answers because they were in a box in Outlook and they had 
not yet had time to look in the box to see if even the answers 
were there. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the concern that we have is that we have raised the 
issue around SPUDCO. There have been so many unanswered 
questions. We got assurance from the Premier of Saskatchewan, 
we got assurance from the Minister Responsible for the 
SaskWater Corporation that we would have answers in a very 

timely fashion. 
 
Now it’s not our fault that they couldn’t find the questions. It’s 
not our fault that they didn’t know that they had left . . . perhaps 
left, we don’t even know for sure if they have left the answers 
in a box, unattended somewheres in Outlook. 
 
And that is of real concern because, Mr. Speaker, once this 
House rises, once we adjourn — and that is expected in a few 
minutes — this House will not sit until likely middle of March, 
barring some unforeseen emergency or issue that might arise in 
the interim. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, with the . . . Under the rules of the House, 
government doesn’t have to answer the question for 180 days, 
which would be near the end of a spring session. And that’s a 
real concern because the people of my constituency, the 
constituency of Rosetown-Elrose, are particularly concerned 
about this issue. There are a number of people that have been 
hurt badly by the SPUDCO fiasco, hurt financially, hurt 
emotionally. They’ve asked that this House provide answers to 
the questions. There is a great concern that money was lost 
because potatoes may have been improperly identified. 
 
And yet, Mr. Speaker, we know that there is a system in place 
that is administered both by the province of Saskatchewan and 
by our federal government that is supposed to assure us that 
proper documentation for the sale and movement of potatoes 
occurs, particularly when those potatoes move out of province. 
And particularly, Mr. Speaker, we would seek those assurances 
if there was some question as to the registration or future 
registration or continued registration or certification of a 
product. 
 
So as you can understand, Mr. Speaker, I’m very, very 
concerned. And people of Saskatchewan, and particularly 
people in the Rosetown-Elrose constituency, are very concerned 
that they get these answers in a timely fashion. Almost no one 
in the Lucky Lake area is growing potatoes. There are many 
producers in the Lucky Lake area that know how to grow 
potatoes. There is equipment in the Lucky Lake area, but until 
some of these matters are cleared up, until confidence is 
restored in the system that this government is responsible for 
and that the Minister for SaskWater is responsible to uphold, 
it’s unlikely that producers are going to sign contracts to get 
back into the potato industry. They’ll have to employ their 
irrigation equipment growing other crops, even though potatoes 
because it’s a rotational crop, you know, you just can’t delay 
and delay that without serious financial concerns to your 
operation. 
 
Mr. Speaker, questions that I asked regarding SaskWater and 
SPUDCO was whether they had received compensation from 
Monsanto for any of the genetically modified NewLeaf 
potatoes. Now it’s difficult to understand, Mr. Speaker, why the 
answer to that question would be left in a box in Outlook. You 
know, it defies logic that that type of information would not be 
available to the minister responsible for SPUDCO. It’s 
unfathomable that they wouldn’t have been able to . . . you 
know, that they wouldn’t have kept those records in a central 
location and have that information readily available. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the other questions, some of them were in more 



1994 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2004 

detail about the quantities. And I can understand that perhaps 
they wouldn’t have all of the bills of lading and that sort of 
thing as to, you know, how many tonnes of potatoes were 
moved, whether it was bulk or whether it was packaged. I can 
understand, and I have some sympathy for the Government 
Whip in that regard. But when it comes to the GMO 
(genetically modified organism) potatoes, that they wouldn’t 
even know whether they had gotten compensation from 
Monsanto, doesn’t seem like the kind of information you’d tuck 
away in a box and leave it in who knows where — in an office 
somewheres, I presume, or maybe it was even a potato shed in 
Outlook, Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the other questions that we are dealing with 
include whether or not the potato packaging processing 
companies were informed by SaskWater and SPUDCO that 
they were buying genetically modified NewLeaf potatoes. Now 
again, this is information that should be at the minister’s 
fingertips. This issue has been touched on, not just in this 
session of the legislature, but earlier. There was a question 
about whether or not SPUDCO was involved in this new 
generation of genetically modified potatoes. 
 
This is not something that was sprung on the government; the 
issue has been raised in the past. And we would expect that the 
minister, that the NDP government would have done their 
homework and they would know where this information was. 
You would think that they, because we had discussed prior to 
the opening of this fall session that we would raise the issue of 
SPUDCO, you’d think they’d have their fingers on the 
information, that they would be ready to answer our questions 
— especially when the minister brags, and the Premier brags, 
and the Deputy Premier was bragging that they were doing to 
give us all the answers to all the questions we asked. Well, quite 
frankly, they didn’t; they didn’t do due diligence, Mr. Speaker. 
They didn’t make sure they had their act together. They were 
making claims; they were doing some boasting and they aren’t 
able to follow through. At least it seems like they’re not able to 
follow through. 
 
And in fact we’re concerned, Mr. Speaker, that the answer 
might not come for another 180 days, which is unacceptable, as 
we know that plans for growing a new crop of potatoes have to 
occur in the very near future. 
 
Another concern, Mr. Speaker, is that families are currently 
hurting, and currently left up in the air over this issue. And I 
think of the Dolman family. The Dolman family were 
bankrupted by the fact that SPUDCO contracted with them to 
grow this variety of potatoes and the bottom fell out of the 
market. They were assured by SPUDCO that there would be a 
sale for these potatoes. And SPUDCO pulled the rug out from 
under this family and they had to declare bankruptcy. There 
may even be continuing legal implications for the shortcomings 
of SPUDCO in this regard. 
 
The Dolmans need answers. The Dolmans want to know 
whether this was a deliberate, a deliberate — premeditated, if 
you like — plan by SPUDCO, whether it was just lack of 
understanding, ignorance on the part of SPUDCO that they 
would allow this to happen. They want to know these answers 
and they have every right, Mr. Speaker, to know why they were 
given a bad bill of goods. 

Mr. Speaker, there are other questions beside my questions that 
have been asked and we have not even had an assurance that 
they would be answered, and that includes questions that we 
have asked about Microgro. Microgro was in the riding that I 
represented prior to the last election, the riding of 
Rosetown-Biggar. Microgro was located in the community of 
Biggar, a greenhouse. And Microgro contracted with SPUDCO 
to grow new generation genetically modified potato seedlings. 
And they were given a long five-year contract and encouraged 
to go out and borrow money — in fact, I believe they borrowed 
money from SOCO (Saskatchewan Opportunities Corporation), 
another arm of the provincial government — given the contract 
with SPUDCO, that they would have a long-term market for 
these potatoes. Well SPUDCO up and pulled the rug out from 
under them too, and they had to declare bankruptcy, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
These questions need to be asked. And we’ve said until this 
government can get up and give us clear answers that with clear 
evidence, we need a public inquiry. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Mr. Speaker, we think maybe they don’t 
have the answers. Maybe the answers aren’t really in that box in 
Outlook. How do we know? How do we know on November 
30, when we’re about to rise in this place, whether there are 
answers, whether that box contains answers, or whether this is 
just another stalling tactic by the NDP to try to weasel out from 
answering the questions that they promised to answer. 
 
The Minister of SaskWater is sitting over there, made a 
commitment to answer those questions. The Premier of 
Saskatchewan who has said he would come clean, and he has 
come short in the past in fully informing the province about 
SPUDCO, said he’d provide all of the answers in this sitting of 
the legislature. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, we don’t have the answers. We’re not sure 
we’re going to get them. Just the big promise that the answer 
might be in a box in Outlook is pretty shaky given the track 
record of the NDP, given the broken promises, the coming short 
on this issue time and time again. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we need to know that the answers are assured. 
And, Mr. Speaker, we believe this is the clearest way and the 
most professional way that the NDP could provide those 
answers, is to call an independent public inquiry. 
 
Now interestingly, federally, the federal Liberal government 
was involved in a bit of a scandal and it was just prior to an 
election. And so they called the public inquiry and it was pretty 
smart on their part. They got a public inquiry to kind of delay 
dealing with the issue until after the federal election. And right 
now that public inquiry is doing its work. 
 
The NDP have an opportunity to do one better. They have the 
opportunity to call a public inquiry after an election, if they 
really sincerely want to get at the truth, at the bottom of the 
issue, if they really want to let Saskatchewan people know what 
happened — what happened with Con-Force. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that was the company that supposedly the 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1995 

provincial government had contracted with and given a 51 per 
cent share in these potato storage barns. Well, Mr. Speaker, we 
found out from the former minister responsible that he had been 
misleading the people of Saskatchewan and he actually had to 
rise in the House and apologize. I see that the former minister is 
intently following this debate. Must be his way of showing 
remorse for what he has done in the past. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, the government did not willingly, the NDP 
government did not willingly provide us with that information. 
They tried to withhold it. They tried to cover it up. They tried to 
minimize the truth. Just sort of like when you hit the minimize 
button on your computer, it just kind of disappears, they 
thought, if we just hit the minimize button, maybe this 
Con-Force issue will go away. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, eventually the truth has a way of coming out 
and the truth came out about the fact that the government had 
no deal at all with Con-Force. In fact they were paying 
Con-Force additional money to manage these potato storage 
barns, let alone take a full ownership position in the potato 
storage facilities. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, the questions weren’t answered then. They’re 
not being answered now. This is the biggest financial scandal in 
Saskatchewan’s history that’s created by a government — $35 
million and growing, Mr. Speaker — untold legal costs, untold 
costs absorbed by the Department of Justice that aren’t even 
made known to the public. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this scandal is so long-standing that it’s impacted 
the NDP over two elections. They had to withhold the truth 
about Con-Force before the 1999 election. And then before this 
last election in 2003, the Deputy Premier decided to insert 
himself in some jiggery-pokery politics and use or abuse, you 
might say, the justice system to raise a false issue during the 
campaign to somehow try to taint the Saskatchewan Party. 
 
(17:00) 
 
Totally unjustified. The judge laughed at the accusation, but 
nevertheless the Deputy Premier was able to, for one day, make 
this an issue in the election. It shouldn’t have been an issue. He 
had no evidence; there was nothing to substantiate that. But 
again, Mr. Speaker, how will we know, how will we know why 
the Deputy Premier used such skulduggery unless we have a 
public inquiry to get to the bottom of the matter? 
 
Mr. Speaker, there are thousands, hundreds of thousands of 
taxpayers in Saskatchewan that deserve an answer. More than 
deserve an answer, Mr. Speaker, they insist upon an answer to 
the questions that are still unanswered around the SPUDCO 
fiasco. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we’re led to believe that the answers are in a box 
— a box that we haven’t seen, a box that the Whip hasn’t seen, 
a box that he doesn’t even know if there’s anything in this box. 
Mr. Speaker, they don’t know. They are telling me that they 
don’t know what’s in the box. And yet, Mr. Speaker, they’re the 
ones that promised to give the answers in this sitting of the 
legislature. Where’s the beef, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

Mr. Hermanson: — Where are the results that they promised? 
They keep promising over and over again — we’re going to do 
this; we’re going to do that; we’re going to give you the lowest 
bundle of utility of rates. Well we still don’t have the lowest 
bundle of utility rates. They had to give . . . They had to raise 
the rates and then give a little rebate back on the SaskTel bill, 
and they still haven’t got the lowest rates. 
 
Now they expect us to believe that some day they’ll give us the 
answers to the SPUDCO affair even though they’ve been 
dragging their feet for months and months, in fact, years and 
years. And if we don’t get this answer soon, it’ll go into 
decades and decades. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, they smile about it. I see the deputy Whip 
. . . the Government Whip. He’s smiling; he thinks it’s funny. 
Well I’ll tell you, Mr. Speaker, the families that were hurt in 
Lucky Lake don’t think it’s funny. The families that lost money 
on their homes, that had to mortgage, remortgage their farms to 
try to survive — and in fact some didn’t survive and have had 
to end their business involvements in the potato industry here in 
Saskatchewan — don’t think it’s very funny. And, Mr. Speaker, 
I think they’d be pretty disappointed if we just took the 
government’s word that they have this information in a box 
somewheres in Outlook, a box that they haven’t even looked 
into and haven’t gone through. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when potatoes are transported outside the 
province of Saskatchewan, they are required to either have a 
certificate for bulk movement or a ministerial exemption from 
the federal Minister of Agriculture. You’re not allowed to move 
potatoes outside of Saskatchewan unless you have these two 
documents. Mr. Speaker, SPUDCO should know whether they 
had those documents. It shouldn’t be, if it’s in the box, Mr. 
Speaker; it should be, here’s the evidence that we either 
complied with the rules or we didn’t comply with the rules. 
 
What kind of incompetent government doesn’t even know 
weeks after they were asked whether they complied with the 
law of the land, whether in fact they had that bulk movement 
certificate or not? Or whether they had the ministerial 
exemption or not? I asked the Minister Responsible for 
SaskWater just a couple of weeks ago — he was sitting right in 
that chair — and I said to this minister, will you give us the 
information, and he said, yes we will give you the information 
tomorrow. He said tomorrow. He didn’t give us the answer 
tomorrow. 
 
I asked him about an export of potatoes from Saskatchewan to 
Alberta. I asked him for the ministerial exemption. Do you 
know what I got? Do you know what I got, Mr. Speaker? I got 
an invoice — not a ministerial exemption — an invoice from a 
shipment to Manitoba. I asked for the ministerial exemption on 
a sale of potatoes to Alberta, and the Minister Responsible for 
SaskWater gives me an invoice on a sale of potatoes to 
Manitoba. 
 
And he said, here’s the answer. He says, you’ve got your 
answer. Well I didn’t get my answer; I got nothing close to the 
answer, Mr. Speaker. And now we’re supposed to believe that 
in a box in Outlook all the answers to these questions — the 
issue for return for no. 318; also the issue for return for no. 319; 
questions asked by my colleague, the MLA (Member of the 



1996 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2004 

Legislative Assembly) for Kindersley; questions asked by my 
colleague, the MLA for Weyburn-Big Muddy; questions about 
SPUDCO; questions that need to be answered — no answers 
are forthcoming. No certainty. All the Government Whip can do 
is say, well we think the answers might be in a box, and if they 
are, we’ll let you know as soon as we go through this box. 
We’ve got to blow the dust off; we’ve got to go through this 
box. 
 
Well what if the answers aren’t in the box and the NDP again 
have failed to keep their commitment to give the answers? 
They’ve already failed, that we’re not getting the answers in 
this session of the legislature. They may fail completely. We 
may not know the answers when we reconvene this House in 
March. 
 
The NDP just say whatever it takes at the time to try to get by 
till tomorrow. You know, if we can just stall the Sask Party for 
another day. You know, if we can just . . . We’ll just feed them 
this line; hopefully that, you know, we’ll get through tomorrow, 
and then we’ll try and think of something else to get through the 
next day. And maybe we can get through the next week, and 
hopefully they’ll forget, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Well there’s 35 million really good reasons why we shouldn’t 
forget about SPUDCO — 35 millions that hurt the taxpayers of 
Saskatchewan; 35 million reasons that caused a lot of 
Saskatchewan people, hardworking people, hardworking 
families, to lose everything in Saskatchewan; 35 million reasons 
that hurt equipment dealers that sold potato equipment in 
Saskatchewan; 35 million reasons that the banks and other 
investors and lenders don’t trust the Government of 
Saskatchewan and fear to become involved in this province, a 
fear that has hampered economic development and economic 
growth in this province. 
 
This is serious stuff, Mr. Speaker. This is not a game of, you 
know, can we get this fall session done in two weeks and go 
home and have a nice Christmas? Mr. Speaker, the people that 
lost everything haven’t had a nice Christmas for a long time. 
This is not a joke. This is serious business. This is the 
livelihood of Saskatchewan people. This is an industry that the 
NDP practically ruined because SPUDCO didn’t know what 
they were doing and apparently didn’t keep a record of what 
they weren’t doing very well, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, they heckle. They heckle. They think this isn’t 
serious. It’s not serious to them. We know it’s not serious to 
them because there’s been no answers coming from the NDP. 
They have tried to sidestep this issue. They have hoped that, in 
time, people would forget about it. That’s what I think they’ve 
been spinning the media — oh SPUDCO, you know, it’s over 
and done with. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, it’s not over and done with. There’s still an 
industry that’s handicapped because of SPUDCO. There are 
still people, Mr. Speaker, there are still people, Mr. Speaker, 
who are suffering financially or having trouble feeding 
themselves. And we heard about food banks earlier today, Mr. 
Speaker. Well there’s a reason why there are more people 
dependent upon a food bank. It’s because the NDP have been 
destroying their livelihood, as they did to the people in Lucky 
Lake. 

Mr. Speaker, the NDP have showed an horrendous lack of 
respect for the people of Saskatchewan, you know, particularly 
a lack of respect for those who make their living in agriculture. 
And I refer you to court evidence that indicated, or evidence 
following the trial, the trial that they settled out of court, or the 
case they settled out of court, when it was reported that NDP 
lawyers, this firm of Olive Waller Zinkhan & Waller, called 
farmers dumb. 
 
Mr. Speaker, they said, you know, we beat those dumb farmers 
with GRIP (gross revenue insurance program). We’re going to 
beat those dumb farmers with the SPUDCO issue as well. 
That’s the NDP attitude, Mr. Speaker — lack of respect for 
people who work hard, who are honest, who trusted their 
government and were betrayed by their NDP government, Mr. 
Speaker. This is a serious matter, and it’s not one that the NDP 
members should be heckling about. It’s one that they should be 
hanging their heads in shame over because of the damage they 
have done to the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the world is looking at Saskatchewan. The world 
is wondering, can we do business in this province? It’s time to 
turn over a new leaf. You know, it’s funny. These potatoes were 
called NewLeaf potatoes, if I’m not mistaken. 
 
Well it’s time Saskatchewan turned over a new leaf. It’s time 
Saskatchewan had a government that was honest. It’s time to 
have a government that squares with the people of 
Saskatchewan. That’s what the Sask Party is committed to, and 
that’s what the member for Rosetown-Elrose is committed to. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the Government House Leader on his 
feet? 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Once again, members, I would ask . . . We 
have voted on the motion, and I would ask if the member would 
ask for leave to speak to the motion or wait till the next motion 
and . . . So the order, return for 318 has been ordered. 
 
I recognize the member for Rosetown-Elrose. 
 

Return No. 319 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would move, 
seconded by the member for Kelvington-Wadena, that an order 
of Assembly do issue a return for no. 319. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Rosetown-Elrose, seconded by the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena, that an order of the Assembly do issue for 
a return no. 319. Is the Assembly ready for the question? I 
recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a 
general comment first of all with respect to the answering of 
written questions. Just so that the Assembly is aware that when 
I go on to make certain undertakings or provide certain 
undertakings with respect to questions, that we do have a record 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1997 

of providing answers to written questions. That’s not always 
been the case in the Legislative Assembly in Saskatchewan, that 
governments have undertaken to do that or to do that in a timely 
fashion. 
 
But let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that in the twenty-fourth 
legislature, in the second session, 2001 and ’02, 241 questions 
were asked and 21 were left unanswered. All others were 
answered. 2002-03, the third session, 496 questions were asked. 
Seven were negatived because they were not questions that 
could be answered; they were more opinions. And all others 
were answered, either on the day they were called in the House, 
converted to a return, or ordered to be answered at a later date. 
 
In 2003-04, 793 questions were asked, and all were answered. 
In 2004-05 — the first session, Mr. Speaker, and we are 
currently in that session — we’re now up to question 887, I 
believe, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And now we get to the questions that are the subject of debate 
before the Legislative Assembly. The rules state, Mr. Speaker, 
that when the question cannot be answered within a certain 
period of time, because it’s not always possible, logistically 
possible, to answer a question within a period of time, that then 
the government has five days in which to answer that question. 
If they can’t do it, the government can then order that question 
be converted. Sometimes the question can’t be provided 
because the answer is constructed in a way that means it’s 
impossible to provide the answer. 
 
But we also can undertake to issue an order for return, which 
according to the rules of the Assembly, Mr. Speaker, and I refer 
to rule No. 46(3): 
 

An Order of the Assembly for a return must be brought 
down within one hundred and eighty calendar days. 

 
We undertake, Mr. Speaker, with respect to the items that are 
on the agenda and that are outstanding . . . and that includes the 
previous one that we voted off. It includes this specific motion, 
so it includes items 318 through 335 and also including the item 
which was converted today, which is no. 887. That is opposed 
to bringing the answer down within 180 calendar days, we 
undertake to provide the answer within 21 days, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — On the motion moved by the member for 
Rosetown-Elrose, seconded by the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena, that an order of the Assembly do issue for 
return no. 319. 
 
Is the Assembly ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Motion agreed to. 
 

Returns Nos. 320 — 335 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask leave of the 
Assembly to move the returns nos. 320 through 335 inclusive, 
seconded by the member from Cut Knife-Turtleford for each of 
the returns. 
 
(17:15) 
 
The Speaker: — The member has requested leave to combine 
all returns, to move a motion regarding returns 320 through to 
335. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. It has been moved 
then by the member for Kindersley seconded by the member for 
Cut Knife-Turtleford: 
 

That an order of the Assembly do issue for returns nos. 
320 through to 335 inclusive. 

 
Is the Assembly ready for the question? Is it the pleasure of the 
Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. These returns have been 
ordered. 
 
Motion agreed to. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Weyburn-Big 
Muddy. 
 

Return No. 336 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I ask leave to move 
order of the Assembly return no. 336 for question no. 887. 
 
The Speaker: — The member has requested leave to move an 
order for return for no. 336. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. I recognize the 
member for Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Ms. Bakken: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move seconded by 
the member from Saskatoon Silver Springs: 
 

To move an order of the Assembly for return no. 336. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy, seconded by the member for Saskatoon 
Silver Springs:

House Adjournment 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, with your 
indulgence, I plan in a few moments to move a motion with 
respect to adjournment. I wonder if before that, Mr. Speaker, I 
just might make a couple of comments. 
 
And one is to express my appreciation for the work of the 
Opposition House Leader and members of his staff who have 
facilitated the work of this session, have allowed the legislation 
to proceed in an orderly fashion, and also — this was totally 
unexpected when we talked about the session — that we would 
also be dealing with a number of supplementary estimates. That 
was a surprise to me, as it was to the members of the 
opposition. And I appreciate the fact that they took this in stride 
and did the work that is required of members of the Assembly 
to consider these estimates in committee, along with the 
legislation. 
 
And so I want to congratulate all the members of the Assembly 
who are involved in the committee work for the work that they 
have done during the course of these last 12 sitting days. I think 
it fair to say that the people of Saskatchewan are getting good 
value for their money when it comes to their Member of the 
Legislative Assembly, Mr. Speaker. So I want to express my 
appreciation for all Members of the Legislative Assembly and 
again particularly recognize the co-operation of the Opposition 
House Leader. 
 
Mr. Speaker, too, before we adjourn, I want the public to know 
and the people to know, the members of the Assembly to know 
that our thoughts are with the member for Cypress Hills. He has 
experienced a bit of a health setback and all of us are concerned 
for his health. And we hope that when we reconvene in the 
spring that he will be with us. 
 
So too, Mr. Speaker, there are other members of the Assembly 
that may have health issues and our hearts go out to them, and 
our best hopes and our prayers go out to them and we wish 
them well and we look forward to seeing them on our return in 
the spring, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Finally, very briefly to thank you and the Clerk’s office and all 
those who make it possible for us to deal with the business 
that’s brought before us, we say a hearty thank you for all that 
you do to support us in our roles as Members of the Legislative 
Assembly, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And having said that, I wish all the members and all the staff all 
the best in the coming weeks. I never like to talk about 
Christmas before the month of December and here we are, the 
last day of November, but I hope, too, that everyone has a good 
holiday season and that their Christmas and New Year’s are 
joyful ones. 
 
And having said that, Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the 
member for Melfort: 
 



November 30, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1999 

That when this Assembly adjourns at the end of the sitting 
day it shall stand adjourned to the date and the time set by 
Mr. Speaker upon the request of the government, and that 
Mr. Speaker shall give each member seven clear days 
notice, if possible, of such date and time. 
 

I move, seconded by the member for Melfort, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s a pleasure to 
rise and second the motion by the Government House Leader in 
regard to adjourning this fall session. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I think there’s a couple of items for note, very 
briefly, that are important for us to recognize. This is the first 
fall session that we’ve had as part of a transition to a fall and 
spring calendar. It is transitory in that there is the transition 
period of time that we’re going to have to move towards the 
permanent spring and fall calendar, and so it does create its 
challenges, if you like, Mr. Speaker, in order to bring forward 
the appropriate items of House business in a way that meets the 
proper balance of scrutiny. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the official opposition has been very pleased to 
participate in this fall session. We’ve called for these sessions 
over the years and we think it is a very definite improvement. 
And in acknowledging that, I certainly would like to 
acknowledge the Government House Leader and his staff in 
terms of being able to work with the government in terms of 
making sure that all of the issues, both for the government and 
the opposition, are clearly articulated, and as a result the people 
of Saskatchewan are better served by their legislators. 
 
Mr. Speaker, recognizing that we are approaching a very special 
and holy season of Christmas and the new year, I certainly want 
to join with the Opposition House Leader in wishing the 
member from Cypress Hills the very, very best of the season, 
and that he has a complete and speedy recovery from his health 
challenges. I know that he will take the time to be with his 
family and friends. And not only our best wishes with him, Mr. 
Speaker, but I’m sure I can say, on behalf of the Assembly, that 
our prayers are with him as well. 
 
I certainly join with the Government House Leader in also 
wishing everyone good health and good fortune in the new year. 
And I would strongly encourage each of us to take the time that 
we can to be with our family and friends and those dear to us 
because sometimes, when we have health challenges, it’s 
what’s needed in order to make us be more sensitive of the 
preciousness of our family and friends and to have as much 
time as we can in their company. 
 
And so, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you and all the 
members of the Legislative Assembly and to wish everyone a 
very merry and blessed Christmas. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member from 
Regina Douglas Park, seconded by the member for Melfort: 
 

That when this Assembly adjourns at the end of the sitting 

day, it shall stand adjourned to the date and to the time set 
by Mr. Speaker upon the request of the government, and 
that Mr. Speaker shall give each member seven clear days 
notice, if possible, of such date and time. 
 

Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Motion agreed to. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, I move the House do 
now adjourn. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Government House 
Leader that this House do now adjourn. Is it the pleasure of the 
Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Chair: — Motion is carried. This House stands adjourned 
until the call of the Chair. I wish everyone good health and a 
pleasant holiday season. 
 
The Assembly adjourned at 17:26.
