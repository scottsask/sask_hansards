 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 7671 
 November 10, 2015 
 
[The Assembly met at 10:00.] 
 
[Prayers] 
 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Rural and Remote 
Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Ottenbreit: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, today the Association of Fundraising Professionals 
will be handing out awards this afternoon in honour of National 
Philanthropy Day. 
 
It’s my pleasure to introduce to the House a few of those who 
will be receiving awards. Mr. Speaker, Turnbull Excavating 
was among those selected as an outstanding corporate 
philanthropist. Ed Turnbull is here along with staff, Sheila 
Goudy, Keith Cassidy, Becky Conley, and Kristin Dupuis, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Additionally, I’m not sure if he’s entered the Assembly yet, but 
David Hoffort is to be here, selected as an outstanding 
individual volunteer for his work on various boards and raising 
money for non-profit organizations. Attending the legislature 
with him are to be his wife Laura, and son Greg, Mr. Speaker. 
 
What really astounds many about the diversity of the input that 
these individuals do have, it’s not only about raising money for 
a certain cause or a couple of causes, Mr. Speaker, quite often 
involved in many parts of their community, whether it’s 
through their time or their finances, Mr. Speaker. So I ask all 
members to join me in thanking them for their generosity of 
time and money and welcome them to their Legislative 
Assembly. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, I’d like to join with the 
member opposite to very briefly welcome these community 
leaders to their Assembly here today, certainly to thank them 
for their philanthropy as well for their community service on 
many fronts. And these individuals being recognized today, 
very worthy of that recognition. It’s important for us to 
remember as well that they’re a small representation of the 
many across Saskatchewan that build strong communities and 
the bright future that we all deserve. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Advanced 
Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Moe: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. To you 
and through you, I’d like to introduce a number of members 
that have just arrived in our Assembly here today. And they are 
the members of the Mars rover team, Mr. Speaker, from the 
University of Saskatchewan, and they have attended here with 
some members of their family. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with us today we have the University of 
Saskatchewan’s space design team. We have Carl Hofmeister 

— and if you give a wave when I acknowledge you please — 
Austin Shirley, who’s the vice-president of engineering; we 
have Dan Ness, the VP [vice-president] of operations; we have 
Liam Bindle, the electrical team lead; and we have Thomas 
Johnson, the former president. And travelling with them are 
family members: Judith Wright, Mary Johnson, Linda Fox, 
Darlene Smith. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the University of Saskatchewan space design team 
won the European Rover Challenge which was in Poland in 
September of just this past year. Aside from being a huge 
accomplishment for the University of Saskatchewan’s College 
of Engineering, I’m sure an accomplishment of this magnitude 
will do wonders for each of the individual team members’ 
careers. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to congratulate each of the members 
involved in the Mars rover project on their success, and I’d ask 
that all members of the Legislative Assembly welcome the 
University of Saskatchewan’s space design team, each of the 
members that were involved in the Mars rover project to their 
Legislative Assembly. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It gives me great 
honour to rise and join in with the minister to welcome these 
students to their Legislative Assembly. Amazing student leaders 
and we’re so proud of all your accomplishments. 
 
But on a personal level, I also want to say hi to Carl Hofmeister. 
I know his mom couldn’t be here today but she Facebooked me 
this morning and said to make sure to say hello. So hi, Carl, and 
welcome to your Legislative Assembly in particular. But thanks 
to all of you for coming and showing the leadership you do. 
You make Saskatchewan proud. So welcome to your 
Legislative Assembly. 
 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise 
today to present a petition in support of GSAs [gender and 
sexuality alliance] in Saskatchewan schools. And we know this 
government is not doing enough to create safe spaces in our 
schools for sexually diverse students or students bullied because 
of their sexual identity or orientation. And we know that 
gender- and sexually diverse students are four times more likely 
than their heterosexual peers to attempt suicide. I’d like to read 
the prayer, Mr. Speaker: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully 
request that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan 
call on this government to take immediate and meaningful 
action to pass The Respect for Diversity — Student Bill of 
Rights Act and enshrine in legislation the right of 
Saskatchewan students to form GSAs within their schools 
in order to foster caring, accepting, inclusive environments 
and deliver equal opportunities for all students to reach 
their full potential. 



7672 Saskatchewan Hansard November 10, 2015 

Mr. Speaker, the people signing this petition come from the city 
of Saskatoon. I do so present. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 
 
Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Once 
again I rise in reference to petition cell service for northwestern 
Saskatchewan. The prayer reads as follows: 
 

To cause the provincial government to improve cell 
service coverage for northern communities like St. 
George’s Hill, Dillon, Michel Village, Dore Lake, Michel 
Point, and Sled Lake to provide similar quality of cell 
coverage as southern communities currently enjoy. This 
would provide support to our northern industries as well as 
mitigate safety concerns associated with living in the 
remote North. 

 
And, Mr. Speaker, as I’ve said time and time again, this petition 
has been signed from people all throughout Saskatchewan. And 
on this particular page, they’ve been signed from Big River and 
Dore Lake, and I so present. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to rise 
again today to present a petition in support of better seniors’ 
care. The petitioners point out, Mr. Speaker, that we have a 
seniors’ care crisis here in Saskatchewan that the government 
refuses to either acknowledge and address. The petitioners talk 
about chronic understaffing that has led to neglect in our care 
homes and the care of our seniors, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to read 
the prayer: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully 
request that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan 
take the following action: to cause the provincial 
government to immediately undertake meaningful steps to 
improve the quality of seniors’ care in our province, 
including creating more spaces and more choices for 
seniors; ensuring higher standards of care in public 
facilities, private facilities, and for home care; ensuring 
appropriate staffing levels in seniors’ care facilities; and 
providing more support to help seniors remain 
independent in their own homes for as long as they desire. 

 
Mr. Speaker, this petition is signed by citizens of Regina, 
Melfort, and Maple Creek. I so submit. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Lakeview. 
 
Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to present a 
petition in support of better schools. And these petitioners in the 
prayer that reads as follows: 
 

Respectfully request that the Legislative Assembly of 
Saskatchewan call on this government to immediately stop 
ignoring schools and start prioritizing students by capping 
classroom sizes, increasing support for students, and 
developing a transparent plan to build and repair our 
schools. 

 

Mr. Speaker, these petitions are signed by people from 
Saskatoon, and I so submit. Thank you. 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 
 

Remembering Canadian Soldiers 
 
Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise in 
my place today in recognition of Remembrance Day. Tomorrow 
we’ll be all attending Remembrance Day events in our home 
constituency, paying tribute at cenotaphs and Legion halls to 
the men and women who sacrificed so much for our freedom. 
 
Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, we have more soldiers who died 
while serving their country to add to the honour roll this year. 
 
Sergeant Andrew Doiron died earlier this year while deployed 
with Canadian Forces in Iraq and Syria in the fight against ISIS 
[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]. Although he was killed in a 
so-called friendly-fire incident, his sacrifice is no less tragic and 
his service no less honourable. 
 
Lieutenant-Colonel Dan Bobbitt was the commanding officer of 
the 2nd Regiment of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, and 
he died in a training exercise earlier this year near Wainwright, 
Alberta. 
 
In addition to Sergeant Doiron and Lieutenant-Colonel Bobbitt, 
59 soldiers have died by suicide since the end of the Canadian 
mission in Afghanistan. Clearly, we need to do more to ensure 
that our veterans have the mental health supports that they need 
when they return home from the horrors of war. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in remembering the 
members of all of our Armed Forces that we have lost, and in 
committing to making sure that every single veteran gets the 
help they deserve when they return home from fighting for all 
of our freedoms. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Carrot River 
Valley. 
 

Remembrance Day 
 
Mr. Bradshaw: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in this 
Assembly today to acknowledge the sacrifice of all those who 
have donned uniforms in the service to our great nation. 
Tomorrow, Canadians from sea to sea will gather at cenotaphs 
to pay tribute to Canada’s veterans past and present, and to 
thank those who are currently serving. Although we attend 
services and wear poppies in November, the service and 
sacrifice of those who fought for our freedom is something we 
need to remember all year round. 
 
Mr. Speaker, my uncles Bill and Henry Schmitt served in 
World War II. Uncle Henry served in the navy. Uncle Bill 
served in the RCAF [Royal Canadian Air Force]. He 
volunteered and flew in the early years when bombing missions 
into France and Germany had a loss rate of one-third. After 
Uncle Bill finished active service he was recruited to train 
bombing crews, yet he volunteered for active service again 



November 10, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 7673 

where he flew Lancaster bombers until VE [Victory in Europe] 
day. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this year our government unveiled a special 
licence plate that acknowledges the sacrifice of service-men 
and -women. This licence plate, although a small gesture, 
shows how we can acknowledge support for our troops all year 
round. Whether this week of remembrance or all year round, I 
ask members of this Assembly to join me in saying thank you to 
our veterans. Lest we forget. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 

Divas’ Night Out 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, on October 8th I had the 
pleasure to attend the 13th annual Divas’ Night Out. This event 
was an important fundraiser for the YWCA [Young Women’s 
Christian Association] Isabel Johnson Shelter and the Regina 
Transition House. 
 
There was entertainment on the Casino Regina stage and nearly 
100 silent auction prizes from generous donors supporting these 
two important places for women and families in our city. 
Special thanks go to the sponsors of the event: Casino Regina, 
Linka Howe Law Offices, Knight Archer Insurance, Over the 
Moon Accounting, and COPE [Canadian Office and 
Professional Employees Union] Local 397. 
 
Domestic violence takes a serious toll on families here in 
Regina. The Isabel Johnson Shelter and the Regina Transition 
House are licensed for 37 beds and the staff do their very best to 
help women and children in times of crisis. Unfortunately there 
are far too many nights where every bed is needed and other 
women need to wait on the list. Many women express that 
they’re forced to stay in abusive relationships because there’s 
no other place to go with the lack of affordable housing options 
– not only here in Regina, but in communities across 
Saskatchewan. 
 
And so I ask all members to join me in thanking everyone who 
helped make this year’s Divas’ Night Out a success, thanking 
all those who work with those affected by domestic violence, 
and in committing to real action to address the unacceptably 
high rates of domestic violence here in Saskatchewan. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Moosomin. 
 

Fundraisers’ Contributions Recognized 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in the House to speak about three Saskatchewan men who 
made a difference in their communities. Ron Carson, David 
Hoffort, and Ed Turnbull are being recognized by the 
Association of Fundraising Professionals for their remarkable 
commitment to their communities. 
 
Ron Carson is receiving the Outstanding Philanthropist award. 
Ron was nominated by STARS [Shock Trauma Air Rescue 
Society] air ambulance after he raised more than $200,000 at 
the Rescue on the Prairie fundraiser in August. Ron and his 
wife, Shirley, have also donated 500,000 to the St. Joseph’s 
Hospital campaign to fund a new CT [computerized 

tomography] machine. 
 
David Hoffort will be awarded the Outstanding Individual 
Volunteer award. As a board of directors member for the St. 
Joseph’s Hospital Foundation and an involved volunteer and 
active fundraiser, David is no stranger to non-profit 
organizations, being an avid fundraiser for multiple 
organizations. 
 
Turnbull Excavating, owned by Ed Turnbull, will be awarded 
the Outstanding Corporate Philanthropist award. This award 
recognizes businesses that donate money and encourage 
volunteerism among employees. Turnbull Excavating employs 
15 staff, all of whom sit on various boards across southeast 
Saskatchewan. Turnbull Excavating has also donated 200,000 
across southeast Saskatchewan over the last five years. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in congratulating 
Ron Carson, David Hoffort, and Ed Turnbull. Thank you for the 
contributions you have made to your community and province. 
 
[10:15] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cut 
Knife-Turtleford. 
 

World War I and II Film Program on Tour 
 
Mr. Doke: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise in this Assembly 
today to announce that, through partnership with the Yorkton 
Film Festival, the eight-part series titled Stories of Courage will 
be rebroadcasted this year. This series, which recounts the 
experiences of veterans during World War II, will be featured 
on City Saskatchewan on Remembrance Day. This series is part 
of a touring program of films on the First and Second World 
Wars from the collection of the Yorkton Film Festival. In 
addition to the City Saskatchewan broadcasts, Voices of 
Courage will be screened in communities around 
Saskatchewan. Outside of the province, the program will be 
screened at the Calgary War Museum and at the Winnipeg 
Public Library. 
 
The program will also include National Film Board 
productions, Trenches and Frontlines. Mr. Speaker, this series 
gives a first-hand account of Canadian experiences in World 
War II and ensures that voices of the past will continue to 
educate future generations. 
 
Seventeen Second World War veterans of the Canadian Army, 
Royal Canadian Air Force, Royal Canadian Navy, and the 
Canadian Merchant Marine were filmed. Their interviews form 
eight episodes addressing the following themes and subthemes: 
Training and Preparing for War, The Price of Freedom, HMCS 
[Her Majesty’s Canadian Ship] Regina, Prisoners of War, 
Aboriginal War Experience, Supporting the Troops, Soldiers 
Return Home, and Commemoration. 
 
I would invite the Assembly to join me in thanking everyone 
who contributed to this project, including the Yorkton Film 
Festival and City Saskatchewan, for ensuring that this important 
series will continue to reach audiences. I also encourage all 
members to take the time to watch these amazing series. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker. 



7674 Saskatchewan Hansard November 10, 2015 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 
Park. 
 

National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation 
 
Mr. Marchuk: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I had the privilege 
of being in Winnipeg last week for the official opening of the 
National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation located on the 
University of Manitoba campus. This national centre was 
created at the recommendation of the survivors of Canada’s 
residential school system in order to preserve the memory of 
their experience. It is now the permanent home for all 
statements, documents, and other materials gathered by the 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the opening of this centre is an important step in 
acknowledging and apologizing for the government’s role in the 
destruction of the language and culture and forced assimilation 
of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples. It is a gathering place 
of children’s voices. A highlight of the grand opening was 
Education Day, Mr. Speaker, where 1,700 students from grades 
6 to 12 gathered to learn first hand from survivors and leaders 
in the hope that in understanding the past, we can impact the 
future. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this national gathering place is an important step 
toward reconciliation. A key question that was asked, an 
important one that we all must consider is, what kind of country 
do we want to be? I believe the answer will take us on the next 
step towards reconciliation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Eastview. 
 

Students Win Space Design Competition 
 
Mr. Tochor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to 
recognize a group of University of Saskatchewan students that 
have recently made exploring the surface of Mars a little easier. 
Joining us today is Austin Shirley, Dan Ness, Carl Hofmeister, 
Liam Bindle, and Thomas Johnson. They are part of the 
University of Saskatchewan’s space design team that won the 
European Rover Challenge. 
 
This challenge invites teams from all over the world to design a 
robot that can handle the rough terrain of Mars. The rover, 
designed by 20 students at the U of S [University of 
Saskatchewan], resembles the rover currently on Mars, with a 
few improvements, Mr. Speaker. It has a mechanical arm that 
can perform human tasks, as well as large wheels to move 
easily over large rocks. 
 
Winning this competition is an amazing achievement. It puts 
Saskatchewan and the University of Saskatchewan at the 
forefront of space robotics on the global stage, not to mention, 
Mr. Speaker, that achievements like this will be sure to launch 
each of the 20 members’ future careers. 
 
I would like to thank Austin, Dan, Carl, Liam, and Thomas for 
all of their hard work. And, Mr. Speaker, for anyone who is 
interested, I hear the team will be driving the rover around the 
rotunda shortly after question period. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 

QUESTION PERIOD 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 

Government’s Fiscal Management 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, we’ve been hearing 
growing frustration about the Sask Party clawing back money 
and making cuts, all while spending wildly on its mismanaged 
pet projects, Mr. Speaker, with no accountability. So we put 
forward some pretty simple, pretty basic questions, but they 
refused to answer those questions last week. To the Finance 
minister: why? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Doherty: — Mr. Speaker, I don’t think it’s any secret 
to that hon. member or anybody in this House or anybody in 
Saskatchewan that the province is facing some economic 
challenges these days, Mr. Speaker. When you go from 80 or 
$90 oil to 40 or $45 oil, there are some challenges on our 
revenue side, Mr. Speaker. This government is going to manage 
that in the context of a balanced budget like we’ve been doing 
since we came to office in 2007. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — We know that that minister is presiding 
over a massive deficit, Mr. Speaker. And you know, despite 
inheriting a fortune and governing during very sunny times, 
thanks to our natural resources and the hard work of 
Saskatchewan people, the Sask Party still managed to drain the 
rainy day fund, didn’t save a penny, and piled on debt after debt 
after debt. 
 
By the end of the fiscal year in fact, total government debt will 
have increased by over 68 per cent. That’s alarming stuff, Mr. 
Speaker. And now the Sask Party is clawing back money and 
making cuts, but they won’t be transparent to Saskatchewan 
people about it. Why won’t the Finance minister just come 
clean to Saskatchewan people, provide that information on his 
plan here today? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Doherty: — Mr. Speaker, here’s the record of this 
government since we came to office in 2007, Mr. Speaker. The 
priorities of this government relative to what the people of this 
province want to see, relative to what those nine members over 
there would do with respect to their priorities. 
 
In Saskatchewan since 2007, to our universities and our 
post-secondary education sector, Mr. Speaker, funding has 
increased 46 per cent. In our regional health authorities, funding 
has increased 53 per cent. To our municipalities through 
municipal revenue sharing, Mr. Speaker, funding has increased 
109 per cent. In our K to 12 [kindergarten to grade 12] 
education system, Mr. Speaker, funding has increased 30 per 
cent while inflation has gone up a cumulative amount of 17 per 
cent in those last seven years, Mr. Speaker. 
 
This is what the credit rating agencies say about this province as 
recently as October 8th of this year. Mr. Speaker, Standard and 



November 10, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 7675 

Poor’s said, we are affirming our ratings, including our AAA 
credit rating long-term issuer credit rating, on this province. Mr. 
Speaker, this affirmation reflects our view of the province’s 
strong, exceptional liquidity, very low tax-supported tax debt 
burden, and very strong economy. 
 
They went on to say, Mr. Speaker, “The ratings also reflect the 
province’s strong financial management, strong budgetary 
flexibility, and low contingent liabilities.” 
 
That’s what the credit rating agencies say, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, despite years of record 
revenues, what the budget actually shows in the public accounts 
is a government that piled on debt, couldn’t save a penny, and 
drained the rainy day fund, and a government and a Finance 
minister that seems not to have interest in the follies, 
billion-dollar follies of that government with its pet projects 
currently, Mr. Speaker. 
 
We know that the Sask Party is now having a fire sale on farm 
land, and we’re hearing about cuts within ministries and money 
being clawed back from universities, newcomer settlement 
agencies, and other organizations. This government should be 
clean with Saskatchewan people about the cuts and clawbacks 
that it’s presiding over and its plan. The Finance minister 
should certainly commit to table the mid-term update at the start 
of next week to ensure that this legislature has adequate time to 
scrutinize it. Will he commit to doing that? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Doherty: — Mr. Speaker, let’s put the provincial 
debt in proper context in the province of Saskatchewan here. In 
the last full year of the NDP [New Democratic Party] in office 
in 2006-2007, debt as the percentage of GDP [gross domestic 
product] was 24 per cent in this province, Mr. Speaker. In this 
fiscal year, it’s 14 per cent debt as a percentage of GDP. 
 
On a per capita basis in their last full year in office, debt in this 
province was $11,120 per man, woman, and child in this 
province. Today it’s $10,383 per man, woman, and child in this 
province, Mr. Speaker. That’s a better record with respect to 
debt as a percentage of GDP. At the same time, Mr. Speaker, 
this government is investing in highways and infrastructure, 
health care facilities, schools. 
 
While they were closing down schools, Mr. Speaker, while they 
were closing down hospitals, and they refused to pave highways 
in this province, Mr. Speaker, this government is investing in 
the priorities of the people of Saskatchewan while maintaining a 
proper debt percentage, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, we expect better from our 
Finance minister. We expect that he’d provide the facts with the 
proper context. And from their own budget document, it shows 
clearly that 2009, total debt $7.9 billion; this year, an alarming 
$13.3 billion. You want to talk about debt for every man, 
woman, and child. We’re talking about billion-dollar follies: $1 

billion is $1,000 for every man, woman, and child in this 
province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Sadly what we’re seeing from the Sask Party these days is a 
government that just won’t come clean with Saskatchewan 
people on so many fronts. It’s concerning that they won’t come 
clean about the cuts that they’re presiding over. It’s concerning 
that they won’t be transparent with their billion-dollar pet 
projects that they’re mismanaging. And I don’t know why they 
can’t simply commit to Saskatchewan people to bring forward 
the mid-year update that will allow proper scrutiny for the 
people of this province. 
 
How can the Finance minister possibly justify this lack of 
transparency and the lack of a responsible plan? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Doherty: — Mr. Speaker, the mid-year report will be 
out by the end of November. That’s always been the case. It’s 
been tabled by the end of November the last number of years, 
per legislation, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Let’s put in context again the debt situation in this province, 
Mr. Speaker. Since this Premier and this government came to 
office in 2007, 40 per cent of the operational debt of this 
province has been paid down, from $6.8 billion to $3.8 billion, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
This past year, to invest in infrastructure like highways, health 
care facilities, and educational facilities, this government 
borrowed $700 million, Mr. Speaker, to invest in those much 
needed infrastructure enhancements in the province of 
Saskatchewan, at the same time attaching a 2 per cent sinking 
fund to that $700 million to be paid back over 30 years. 
 
Which other financial situation in Canada would this member 
rather have in the province of Saskatchewan, relative to other 
provinces? Would you much rather have . . . 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — You asked the question. Perhaps you’d like to 
hear the response. I recognize the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Doherty: — I would simply ask the member 
opposite, Mr. Speaker, what other province’s financial situation 
or fiscal capacity would they rather have in the province of 
Saskatchewan, in Canada right now, Mr. Speaker? Would you 
rather have the province of Alberta, borrowing $6.2 billion for 
operating, another 6 to $9 billion for their capital infrastructure? 
Would you rather have the province of Ontario who’s at 47 per 
cent net debt as a percentage of GDP, or the province of Quebec 
at 65 per cent? Which other province’s situation would you 
rather have right now? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 

Cardiac Rehabilitation Programming 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In November 2010, 
this government commissioned a report on cardiac rehab 



7676 Saskatchewan Hansard November 10, 2015 

services. They received the report in March 2011, but they 
ignored the recommendations. What’s the Health minister’s 
explanation for this? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, I think the member opposite will know that the 
provincial government provides global funding budgets to 
regional health authorities. In the case of, for example, Regina 
Qu’Appelle Health Region, that increase has been 52 per cent 
over the last eight years under this government. 
 
We certainly will work with our regional health authorities to 
ensure that there is proper programming and proper services 
that are provided within the context of a balanced budget in this 
province and within the context of a growing province and 
growing budgets for the regional health authorities. We have 
certainly worked with our regional health authorities to ensure 
that there are those services provided across this province. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — The reports this government received said 
that cardiac rehab programs are both clinically effective and 
cost effective, and it said that cardiac rehab needed to be 
delivered equitably throughout Saskatchewan. But this 
government ignored that recommendation, so we’re joined by 
18 people here today who are part of Regina’s cardiac rehab 
program. They’re frustrated that the cost of cardiac rehab in 
Regina has jumped by almost 250 per cent. They now pay five 
times what people in Saskatoon pay for cardiac rehab. How can 
the Health minister possibly justify this? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
Well first, Mr. Speaker, I would say to the member opposite 
that regional health authorities are responsible for setting their 
own budgets in the context within the budget allocation that’s 
provided and are responsible for determining their own 
programs. 
 
I will say that Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region does run a free 
cardiac rehabilitation program that includes classes for free at 
various locations around the province that includes RN 
[registered nurse] services, social workers, dietitians, 
pharmacists, and exercise therapists where they will learn about 
understanding heart disease, understanding risk factors, 
medications, nutrition, stress, exercise. There is the ability to be 
referred to the Paul Schwann, as an example, in terms of the 
exercise component, but there are other choices around the city. 
 
The region looked at the program a couple of years ago, looked 
at their utilization numbers were not where they wanted it to be, 
and determined that their best use of their resources was to 
ensure that those services were provided as conveniently as 
possible throughout the city. And that’s why they decided to go 
the route that they did. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 

Ms. Chartier: — In Saskatoon, cardiac rehab costs $90 for 
three months. In Prince Albert, it costs $73. In Moose Jaw, it 
costs $60. In North Battleford and Melville, it’s free, but here in 
Regina, it is $440 for three months. Again how can the Health 
minister justify this? 
 
[10:30] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
would just refer the member, if she does want additional 
information so that she is making a proper comparison, a 
number of the communities that she did mention is in a 
physician-supervised program, so obviously it’s not the same 
program that’s being offered in the city of Regina. 
 
When Regina Qu’Appelle looked at their program as it was 
being offered, they examined it and saw that only 30 per cent of 
patients were actually taking part and taking advantage of the 
cardiac rehab programming. So their decision was that offering 
services solely through the Paul Schwann Centre was not 
providing the accessibility because people were choosing not to 
go to the Paul Schwann. 
 
What they decided to do was to ensure that there were the 
educational components throughout the city at various locations 
several times a week that are free. And if people thought it was 
more accessible for them to access exercise programs — 
perhaps if you live in the Northwest, perhaps Gold’s Gym is 
more accessible than driving to the Paul Schwann Centre — 
then those patients are free to choose that. 
 
I would say that any patient, cardiac or otherwise, would need 
to consult their specialist and a doctor before taking part in any 
exercise program. But that’s the decision that Regina 
Qu’Appelle decided to make. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Mr. Speaker, I’ll refer the minister to his own 
report on cardiac rehab services that talks about equitable 
access to programming, Mr. Speaker. Lyn Goldman is a heart 
attack survivor who benefits from the cardiac rehab program in 
Regina. Lyn says the program has become “a program for rich 
people.” That is not acceptable. When people need cardiac 
rehab, they should not face huge financial barriers. Is the Health 
minister finally going to do something about this, or is he going 
to keep ignoring the problem? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, again there are two 
components that we’re talking about when it comes to Regina 
Qu’Appelle Health Region. There is the cardiac rehab program, 
as run by the Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region, that does 
include RNs, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, exercise 
therapists. It’s provided at various locations across the city to 
improve accessibility. It goes through a variety of programs in 
terms of understanding heart disease, your risk factors, 
nutrition, areas around medication, stress, and exercise. And 
that is free of charge. 



November 10, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 7677 

There is also the ability to be referred to an exercise program 
that is a physician-supervised program. But that is one option. 
People have other options in this city. It’s a big city. People 
have accessibility challenges, depending on where they live in 
the city. And so, Mr. Speaker, there is still the ability though to 
have the service provided by Regina Qu’Appelle. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would say to the member opposite, in terms of 
the services that she references in other cities, she really isn’t 
comparing apples to apples. I would encourage her to look into, 
for additional details. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Mr. Speaker, the program is only an option if 
you can afford it. Cardiac rehabilitation is about improving 
people’s everyday quality of life, but it also saves our health 
care system a lot of money. It reduces hospital readmission by 
31 per cent and reduces deaths from heart attacks by 26 per 
cent. Proper cardiac rehabilitation saves up to $28,000 in health 
care costs per person. It should be accessible to everyone who 
needs it. That is the fair thing to do, and it is the fiscally 
responsible thing to do. 
 
So again to the Health minister: why won’t he put an end to this 
unfair financial barrier to something as vital as cardiac 
rehabilitation. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Again, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, when 
the program was offered through the Paul Schwann Centre, the 
Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region found that only 
approximately 30 per cent of eligible patients were actually 
accessing the program, and some had various reasons, including 
accessibility. The Paul Schwann is obviously located at the 
University of Regina and some people had challenges in terms 
of being able to access the program. 
 
What the region decided to do was look in terms of offering the 
free component of the cardiac rehabilitation education 
component in a variety of locations around the city. They do 
currently provide that, and they are working to enhance a 
patient’s ability to access either home-based or in-community 
exercise programming. As well there’s always private options 
including gymnasiums, gyms around the city. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would say that I’ve had a conversation with the 
Minister for Advanced Education. He’s reaching out to the 
university to see whether or not to address some of the 
challenges with the upfront cost, whether or not there’s the 
ability for the Paul Schwann Centre to equalize that payment 
over an entire year for people that do sign up for a year that may 
make it more financially viable. We are following up with the 
university on that. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 

SaskPower and Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, could the SaskPower minister 

please explain why SaskPower’s projected emissions for 2015 
and 2016 have skyrocketed? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Economy. 
 
Hon. Mr. Boyd: — Mr. Speaker, in the province of 
Saskatchewan, SaskPower is charged with the responsibility of 
generating electricity for the people of Saskatchewan to use in 
their homes, to use in their businesses, and to use in industry, 
Mr. Speaker. Those sources of energy range in a number of 
areas, from hydro to wind energy, Mr. Speaker, the use of coal 
for generating electricity, the use of natural gas. 
 
Some of those sources of course have GHGs [greenhouse gas] 
associated with them, Mr. Speaker, and that’s precisely the 
reason why the Government of Saskatchewan took the initiative 
and carried forward with the BD3 [Boundary dam 3] program, 
Mr. Speaker, to reduce the GHG emissions from that facility, 
Mr. Speaker. It’s an important addition to the fleet here in 
Saskatchewan of generating sources, Mr. Speaker, and we think 
it’s something that the people of Saskatchewan see as 
responsible. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, in its annual report released last 
summer, SaskPower laid out its emission targets for 2015 and 
2016. But in the annual report it released just this year, 
SaskPower’s targets for 2015 and 2016 had jumped by almost 
800 000 tonnes. Lots of changes in one year; that’s like adding 
200,000 cars to our roads. 
 
So I wrote to the SaskPower president about this last month, 
and the response I got didn’t even mention problems with the 
carbon capture project, and gave no real explanation. But it 
referred to this 800 000 tonne increase in emissions as a small 
fluctuation. So it’s a simple question to the SaskPower minister: 
what’s behind this massive increase in SaskPower’s emission 
targets? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Economy. 
 
Hon. Mr. Boyd: — Mr. Speaker, we have something in 
Saskatchewan happening that hasn’t happened in a long time in 
our province, Mr. Speaker. We have an increase in population 
here in Saskatchewan. We have record hookups of people to the 
SaskPower network, Mr. Speaker. We have more power being 
consumed by industry here in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. We 
have more power being consumed in every area of our 
province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And as a result of that, Mr. Speaker, GHG emissions are going 
to rise. No question about that, Mr. Speaker. And again, that’s 
the reason why we’ve undertaken to remove GHG gases from 
the atmosphere through the BD3 program, Mr. Speaker. About 
400 000 tonnes of CO2 has been removed through that process, 
Mr. Speaker. It’s the responsible thing to do, Mr. Speaker. 
We’ll continue on that, Mr. Speaker. In addition to that, 
SaskPower will be announcing here very soon whole new 
initiatives around renewables, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 



7678 Saskatchewan Hansard November 10, 2015 

Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, it looks like the government has 
put all its eggs in the carbon capture basket, but now they’ve 
dropped the basket. It’s disturbing to see SaskPower’s target for 
emissions jump by 800 000 tonnes. That’s the equivalent of 
200,000 cars over the course of just one year. And what’s most 
shocking is that this jump in emission targets happened at the 
same time as the Premier and many of these Sask Party MLAs 
[Member of the Legislative Assembly] were repeatedly 
bragging about having removed the equivalent of 250,000 cars 
off the roads.  
 
How can the SaskPower minister justify increasing the emission 
targets by the equivalent of 200,000 cars at the same time that 
the Premier was inaccurately bragging about removing 250,000 
cars off our roads. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for the Economy. 
 
Hon. Mr. Boyd: — Mr. Speaker, we have a growing economy 
in Saskatchewan. I would hope that the member opposite would 
acknowledge that, Mr. Speaker. We have a growing economy. 
We have more people than we’ve ever had in the history of our 
province now call Saskatchewan home, Mr. Speaker. 
 
They are consuming more and more power all of the time, Mr. 
Speaker, and as a result of that there are going to be emissions 
associated with it. That’s why we’ve taken the initiative as we 
have done, Mr. Speaker. And when the member opposite says, 
you’ve put all your eggs in one basket, that couldn’t be further 
from the truth, Mr. Speaker. SaskPower is adding the wind 
capability here in Saskatchewan. We are looking at solar. We 
are looking at geothermal. SaskPower is looking at . . . 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Boyd: — Mr. Speaker, so as a result of that we have 
many, many things that are happening that are on the renewable 
front here in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. The only thing that 
the NDP had when they were operating this government, Mr. 
Speaker, was we had a basket case for an economy. That’s what 
we had here in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. And as a result of 
that, that’s why you’re sitting there with the rump of a party that 
used to have the government benches. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 

Government Sale of Farm Land 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, we have many more questions 
about this carbon capture boondoggle, but we are also hearing 
from a lot of people throughout Saskatchewan that are upset 
about this government’s fire sale of publicly owned farm land. 
Farmers are very upset about being forced to either buy the land 
or pay higher rent. Others are upset that this government is 
selling off valuable public assets at fire-sale prices. And the 
common theme in all these messages is that people recognize 
that this government is just desperate for money. 
 

Will the Agriculture minister just admit that this fire sale of 
publicly owned farm land is just a desperate cash grab? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Agriculture. 
 
Hon. Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the 
member for her question. This is certainly not about fire selling 
anything or about the revenue that it will generate. Us members 
on this side of the House, on the government side of the House, 
Mr. Speaker, believe that where there’s no public benefit to the 
government owning farm land, that it should be left in the hands 
of farmers and ranchers of this province who can accrue 
value . . . 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — Will the member for Regina Rosemont and 
the Minister of Government Relations either get up and ask and 
answer questions or take it outside? I recognize the Minister of 
Agriculture. 
 
Hon. Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We believe 
and we campaigned on this. We campaigned on this in 2007, 
Mr. Speaker, before we became government that we would sell 
this particular parcel of land. And we had a previous sales 
program, an incentive program that started in 2008, ended in 
2014, under which we sold about half of it. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, this isn’t anything new. It’s not about budget. 
It’s not a fire sale. It’s trying to get the land back in the hands of 
the people that should own it. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — Here is a simple question, Mr. Speaker. How 
much does the Agriculture minister plan to make off of this fire 
sale? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Agriculture. 
 
Hon. Mr. Stewart: — Well the member, if she ever gets into 
government, will understand that the Minister of Agriculture is 
not going to make anything off this. Any revenue that is 
generated will go into the General Revenue Fund as always, 
Mr. Speaker. I don’t know, I haven’t calculated how much 
revenue might be generated by this, but that’s not my concern. 
But, Mr. Speaker, it is my concern to try to get as much of this 
land as possible back under the ownership of the farmers and 
ranchers of this province and not under the ownership of 
government. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when those members opposite were the 
government of this province, they bought this land from 
farmers. And they competed against farmers in the land market, 
drove up the price of land at a time just before interest rates 
went crazy, and kept many farmers out of the land market for a 
decade. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Nutana. 
 
Ms. Sproule: — No answer, Mr. Speaker. But I can tell you, 



November 10, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 7679 

the minister has previously said about 600,000 acres will be put 
up for sale for about $425 per acre. So that’s 255 million 
potentially to flow in to help fill this government’s budget hole. 
Meanwhile the people of Saskatchewan will no longer own this 
valuable resource which has a return every year on the lease 
values, and many farmers will be forced to either buy their land, 
pay higher rent, or vacate the land. To the minister: how can he 
possibly justify this hasty fire sale of publicly owned farm land? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Agriculture. 
 
[10:45] 
 
Hon. Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is a great 
illustration of why we are the government and why they are not. 
Mr. Speaker, they think that the government should own all the 
farm land in Saskatchewan — every acre, every bit of it. They 
bought as much as they could before they got run out of office 
in 1982 and, Mr. Speaker, they’d do it again. They’d do it again 
if they could get away with it. Mr. Speaker, we’re trying to put 
it back into the hands of the farmers and ranchers that owned it 
before they bought it. 
 

PRESENTING REPORTS BY STANDING 
AND SPECIAL COMMITTEES 

 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Chair of the Human Services 
Committee. 
 

Standing Committee on Human Services
