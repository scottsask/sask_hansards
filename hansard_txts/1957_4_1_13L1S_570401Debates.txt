LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

First Session — Thirteenth Legislature 

33rd Day 

 

Monday, April 1, 1957 

 

The House met at 2.30 o’clock p.m. 

On the Orders of the Day: 

 

CORRECTION OF PRESS REPORT 

 

(Oil Company Investigation) 

 

Mr. Ross A. McCarthy (Cannington):  Mr. Speaker, I would like to call attention to the fact that 

something I brought up on the Orders of the Day on Friday was reported in the press, as saying that I 

asked that the reference be broad enough to include all the companies in the southeast. I certainly did not 

say that. I agree with the Premier that we have a lot of oil companies down there that are doing a good 

job. What I did say was that it should be broad enough to take in all the companies in the southeast 

where there is a suspicion of misrepresentation, and that is quite a different thing from taking in all the 

companies in the southeast. I certainly know the people I represent would not want me to say that. I 

wouldn’t want to say it myself, and I agree with the Premier that many of those companies should not be 

disturbed. But there are certain exceptions, and those are the ones that I suggest that the terms should be 

broad enough to take in.
