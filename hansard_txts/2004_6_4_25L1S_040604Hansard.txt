INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It gives me great 
privilege and pleasure to introduce to you and through you to 
the members of this Assembly, a group of 45 students from the 
communities of Climax, Frontier, and other smaller 
communities possibly further east and west. And they’ve come 
to join us this morning as part of a school tour to Regina for two 
days. It’s too far to come for just one day, Mr. Speaker. 
 
With this group of 45 students from grades 6 to 9 are teachers 
Brad Gasper, June Evenson, and Gail Wilson. And we have 
chaperones Kay Smith, Marlene Carlson, Michelle Danskin, 
Ernie Coakley; and bus drivers, Norm Baker and Joel 
Christianson. 
 
These students, Mr. Speaker, are here today not just to see if 
democracy works, but if it works for them. And I’d like all 
members of this Assembly to welcome them to this House. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Yorkton. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. This 
morning I want to introduce, in the west gallery, 35 students 
from one of the fine constituencies in the province, from 
Yorkton, and probably one of the finest schools in the province 
as well, I might say, from the Yorkdale School Division, along 
with the students from Maple Creek, of course. 
 
I want to recognize this morning as well Kathleen Henderson, 
as well as Val Jeske, who are the teachers; the teacher 
assistants, Brenda Prodonchuk and Diane Gleason; the 
chaperones, Bruce Peppler, Janice Friske, Bev Dutchak, 
Caroline Trost, and Gail Ducharme. 
 
In a few moments after question period I’ll have an opportunity 
to meet with the students and their chaperones and have some 
refreshments. We’re going to have a photo, and we always have 
some good discussion about the protocol of the legislature so I 
expect today that the students and the chaperones will witness 
the opposition at their best behaviour. Thank you very much, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier, the member for 
Saskatoon Riversdale. 
 

60th Anniversary of D-Day 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, Sunday, June 6 marks the 60th anniversary of D-Day 
when allied troops landed in Normandy, beginning the final 
push toward the liberation of Europe and the end of the Second 
World War. 
 
Mr. Speaker, from the point of view of the overall allied effort, 

the D-Day invasion was without doubt the most perilous and 
significant action of the entire war and Canadians played a 
significant role in it. Mr. Speaker, 10,000 Canadians were in the 
armada that crossed the channel that day. An additional 14,000 
Canadians landed on Juno Beach. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as we well know, the Royal Regina Rifles was one 
of the first Canadian assault battalions to land on Juno Beach 
and was also one of the most successful allied units in terms of 
achieving its objectives. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we in Saskatchewan this weekend are deeply 
honoured, as part of the commemoration of the activities of the 
60th anniversary, to welcome this weekend The Princess Royal, 
who is the Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Regina Rifles. 
 
Mr. Speaker, every June 6 has a very special meaning for our 
family. My dad crossed the channel in the second wave of 
Canadians to go into France just after D-Day and he was one of 
the fortunate ones who returned, but what he and many like him 
left behind was their youth. 
 
And so, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today, with the member of 
Wood River, to ask all of our colleagues to join us in 
acknowledging the tremendous debt of gratitude that we owe to 
all of those Canadians who sacrificed in the cause of freedom 
on D-Day, June 6, 1944. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too rise on 
behalf of members to ask the House to solemnly recognize the 
60th anniversary of D-Day. 
 
There’s no doubt in anyone’s mind that it was a sacrifice of 
thousands of brave young soldiers from the relatively unknown 
country of Canada that helped turn the tide of the war in 1944 in 
favour of the Allies. 
 
It was also, Mr. Speaker, the battle of Normandy that turned an 
inexperienced army into a formidable foe and earned the respect 
and recognition of all Allied countries. The battle of Normandy 
began in the early hours of June 6, 1944. Fourteen thousand 
Canadians landed on the beaches, and hundreds more either 
parachuted or landed by glider behind enemy lines, and even 
more were guarding the skies above the beaches. 
 
Of those who landed on Juno Beach, Saskatchewan’s presence 
was front and centre. Some of the troops were members of the 
Royal Regina Rifles, and their participation in D-Day is 
recognized this weekend in formal ceremonies featuring Her 
Royal Highness, the Princess Royal. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as thousands of veterans from across this country 
gather in Normandy this weekend to mark this event, we are 
reminded that only a handful of them are still with us today. It’s 
expected that this will be the last trip for many of them, and we 
owe them a great deal of gratitude that can never be repaid. 
How does one put a price on freedom and peace, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Mr. Speaker, Sunday, June 6 also happens to be Armed Forces 



1404 Saskatchewan Hansard June 4, 2004 

Day in Canada and we are reminded that 60 years after one of 
the greatest and bloodiest battles in military history, Canadian 
troops remain dedicated to fighting for peace. 
 
I ask all members to recognize the 60th anniversary of D-Day 
and Armed Forces Day. We must remember those who have 
fallen fighting for our country, and we must remember those 
that still do. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, I would now like to ask you to call for a 
moment of silence. 
 
The Speaker: — Is leave granted for a moment of silence? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — By leave, would members rise for a moment 
of silence. 
 
The Assembly observed a moment of silence. 
 
The Speaker: — Thank you, please be seated. I recognize the 
member for Cumberland. 
 
(10:15) 
 

First Nations and Métis Contributions in World War II 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — Mr. Speaker, on the eve of the 60th 
anniversary of D-Day, it is my honour to pay tribute to the 
contributions and sacrifice that Aboriginal people made on 
behalf of our country in time of war. 
 
Canada’s First Nations and Métis people have been involved in 
every major conflict in which Canada has been a participant. 
They have fought and served overseas and they have supported 
the cause at home. 
 
Mr. Speaker, World War II is no exception. No one knows how 
many Aboriginal men and women served in Canada’s Armed 
Forces during that war. What we do know is that they served in 
every major battle we fought including the ill-fated Dieppe raid, 
and the event we are commemorating this weekend — the 
D-Day invasion. 
 
We also know that many were killed or died from wounds 
received during battle, and that at least 18 were decorated for 
bravery in action. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Aboriginal people also contributed to the war 
effort here at home. Some joined the Pacific Ocean defence 
while others worked in factories. Some First Nations donated 
land that was used for airports, rifle ranges, and defence posts. 
Canada’s Aboriginal people also donated thousands of dollars 
to the war effort through various charities. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to have this opportunity to honour the 
contributions that First Nations and Métis people made to 
Canada in times of conflict, and to pay tribute to the Aboriginal 
soldiers who made so many sacrifices, some the supreme 
sacrifice, in the cause of freedom and of peace. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 

Visit of The Princess Royal 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It will be a royal 
weekend in Saskatchewan with the visit by Princess Anne, Her 
Royal Highness. The Princess Royal, as she is known formally, 
arrives in the province this evening to begin what will be a very 
quick few days. 
 
Princess Anne will visit Battleford, North Battleford, 
Saskatoon, and Regina. And the protocol office reports that the 
focus of the visit is the D-Day anniversary as has been 
mentioned by the Premier and other ministers . . . and other 
members, rather. 
 
The best opportunity for the public to see the Princess Royal, 
according to the protocol office, will at 10 a.m. tomorrow 
morning in front of the Legislative Building. Of interest to note, 
Mr. Speaker, in Canada, Princess Anne is Colonel-in-Chief of 
the Royal Regina Rifles of Saskatchewan. 
 
Her last visit to Saskatchewan was back in 1982, so it is with 
great pleasure that she is welcomed back. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan Party MLAs (Member of the 
Legislative Assembly) will be taking part in activities related to 
the royal visit over the weekend. And with that, Mr. Speaker, 
the official opposition is indeed welcoming and looking 
forward to the visit to our province by the Princess Royal, 
Princess Anne. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Wascana 
Plains. 
 

Honouring Canadian Women’s Military Service 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Whether overseas 
or keeping the home fires burning, Canadian women are among 
the unsung heroes of World War II. During the war, 45,000 
Canadian women volunteered for military service and of that 
number, one in nine was chosen to serve overseas. 
 
Women were first assigned to the laundry service and as greater 
needs were organized and reorganized and recognized, 
women’s roles expanded to drivers, clerks, cooks, messengers, 
and canteen helpers. In May 1942, Canadian nurses became the 
first in any Allied country to have official officer status with 
equivalent power of command. Mr. Speaker, by the end of the 
war, 3,000 women were overseas, comprising 1.5 per cent of 
the Canadian military. 
 
Much of the female population of Canada stayed home during 
World War II to continue raising their families, farming the 
land, and filling the jobs left unoccupied by servicemen. During 
this time, many women were employed in factories and 
machine shops, manufacturing, and equipment necessary for the 
war. 
 
Mr. Speaker, although women’s work during the war was 
invaluable, their contributions were often disregarded and 
undervalued. Overseas, women were paid only one-third of 
men’s salaries, and back home after the war ended many 



June 4, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1405 

women were forced out of their factory jobs and told to return 
to their duties in the home. 
 
Mr. Speaker, on this the 60th anniversary of D-Day, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in honouring the many women who 
filled the vital roles during World War II. Whether military or 
non-military, their contributions were essential and for this we 
owe them our gratitude. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Batoche. 
 

10th Anniversary of Tillage Days 
on Seager Wheeler Farm 

 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to start 
my member’s statement with a quote from the late Seager 
Wheeler: 
 

The soil is ours to make or mar and we should aim to leave 
it, when the time comes for us to pass on — in as good or 
better condition than when it came under our hands. 
 

Seager Wheeler was without a doubt the largest influence in 
dry-land farming in Saskatchewan, in fact the world. Seager 
Wheeler won the world wheat competition five times, a record 
that still stands. He was known as the wheat wizard of Rosthern 
or as the world wheat king. His innovations in plant breeding, 
not only in wheat but also fruit orchards, were world leaders. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this has been the cornerstone for the people who 
now manage his farm, Maple Grove Farm at Rosthern. 
 
June 2 was the 10th anniversary of Tillage Days at the Seager 
Wheeler Farm, and they had panel discussions on minimum till, 
panel discussions on corn seeding, biotech diesel 
demonstrations with a tractor running on canola oil and the 
exhaust smells like french fries, numerous displays on new 
tillage equipment. But of course the most important was going 
into the fields and seeing the equipment work side by side with 
the competition. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ben Heppner and myself were present for the 
day’s event and had a wonderful time. I would suggest anyone 
travelling along Highway 11 past Rosthern, stop in this summer 
and tour the Canadian heritage site — a tribute to a great 
Canadian. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Douglas 
Park. 
 

Dutch Royal Family in Canada 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, following the D-Day 
landings, Canadian troops who had been fighting in France, 
Italy, and Belgium were moved to the Netherlands. The 
liberation of the Netherlands by Canadian Armed Forces is one 
of the most significant events in the history of that country. 
 
During the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, a key objective 

of the invaders was the capture of the Dutch royal family. 
Fleeing to temporary safety in England, Queen Wilhelmina 
decided to send her daughter, the heir to the Dutch throne, to 
Canada. Princess Juliana and her two small children lived in 
Government House in Ottawa and during their stay Princess 
Juliana gave birth to a daughter. 
 
Mr. Speaker, since Dutch law requires that members of the 
Royal family be born on Dutch soil, the Government of Canada 
enacted a statute that declared a wing of the Ottawa Civil 
Hospital a temporary Dutch protectorate, in order that the new 
infant could technically be born in the Netherlands. 
 
In the fall of 1945, as a thank-you gesture for providing 
sanctuary for her family during the conflict, Queen Juliana 
presented 100,000 tulip bulbs to the people of Canada. And 
every year since then, the Dutch people have donated 10,000 
additional tulip bulbs in recognition of the hospitality that was 
shown to the Dutch royal family, and for the pivotal role that 
Canada played in their liberation. 
 
In 1995 a further 1,000 bulbs were donated to each provincial 
and territorial capital in Canada, some of which were planted 
and are currently blooming west of the Legislative Building 
here in Regina. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as a Dutch immigrant to Canada after the Second 
World War, I would like to add my voice of thanks and 
appreciation to those who gave so much to ensure our freedom 
and our liberty. Thank you, Canada. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 

Out-of-Province Medical Referrals 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you. Mr. Speaker, to the Minister of 
Health: has the government approved funding for Kathryn Wipf 
to receive treatment at the Mayo Clinic? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, as indicated yesterday, the 
process is ongoing. The particular situation in this case is that 
we have a process where a Saskatchewan specialist 
recommends in writing that the treatment is necessary and not 
available in Saskatchewan or elsewhere in Canada. That has 
happened. They’ve looked, and they’ve discovered that the 
Alberta specialists recommend that this person goes on to the 
States. 
 
A letter was written by the Saskatchewan specialist on June 1— 
that’s earlier this week — to the Mayo Clinic. We’re waiting 
for a response from the Mayo Clinic. Since Monday they’ve 
already been contacting them, since yesterday, by telephone to 
get that response so this can go forward. Mr. Speaker, the 
normal response time when a request goes forward is within 
two days. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 



1406 Saskatchewan Hansard June 4, 2004 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, this is unbelievable. If this 
isn’t a clear-cut case for approval of out-of-province treatment, 
I don’t know what is. This little girl has seen specialists in 
Saskatchewan. She’s been to specialists in Calgary, and they 
indicate by letter that they can’t help her. They say she needs to 
go to the Mayo Clinic for treatment, or she’s going to lose her 
leg. 
 
Kathryn Wipf needs approval for this treatment now. Why 
doesn’t the minister stand up and approve this request today. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, it’s not my role as the 
Minister of Health to do this approval. We work with the 
professionals to do that. I anticipate, given all of the 
information that we have, that that approval will be 
forthcoming, but we don’t make those decisions until we have 
all of the information. And we’re waiting for the information 
from the Mayo Clinic. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to point out that there are very rare 
circumstances where this particular issue is involved, where a 
patient from Saskatchewan is required to go outside of Canada 
for treatment. As we all know, sending patients to the States can 
be very, very expensive, but we will do it, and we do it on a 
regular basis. 
 
Last year, in the ’02-03 year, we had 33 patients that went to the 
United States. We paid about $400,000 in doctors’ fees and 
over $700,000 in hospital fees. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we continue to work to make sure we get the best 
value for all of our dollars that we spend in the health care 
system, but absolutely we are going to get care for our young 
people and all of our people in Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, this minister has to decide 
when he gets up in the morning what his job is. Is he here to be 
an apologist for an inefficient, ineffective bureaucracy that 
takes far too long — that takes far too long — for approvals for 
this little girl to be made? Is he going to sit here and tell the 
people of Saskatchewan that we’re worried that this treatment 
for this little girl is going to be too expensive? 
 
Mr. Speaker, there should be a process that’s transparent and 
happens in a timely way. The Wipfs should not have to come to 
this legislature, to their legislature, to seek support for their case 
for their child to be treated in the Mayo Clinic. 
 
Mr. Speaker, will this minister take responsibility for his role as 
the Minister of Health to the people of Saskatchewan and not 
the ministry of Health, and stand up for this little girl and 
approve her treatment? 
 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, normally 
when we get the information it takes less than 48 hours to get 
the approval. We understand that the information was requested 
on Monday of this week; this is Friday. We don’t have the 
information from the Mayo Clinic, but we expect that we will 
have it shortly, and that will be easily in time for the June 14 
deadline. I’m not going to make that decision here in that 
process. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what I object to — what I strongly object to — is 
that member’s continued attack on the civil service and all the 
people who work in the health care system. He continually goes 
after people in a way that’s totally inappropriate because we end 
up here in this province working and trying to set up 
appropriate procedures so that we make the most effective use 
of our dollars and also make sure that we get the best patient 
care. 
 
And all of the people who are working with this young girl are 
very concerned about her. I’m a father. I know the member 
opposite’s a father and a grandfather. And all of these things are 
very important and clear . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, what I object to is this 
minister’s lack of leadership on behalf of the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, what I object to is this 
minister’s reliance on a lot of bureaucratic mazes and 
bureaucratic impediments to letting proper health care go 
forward in a timely manner for the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what I object to is the fact that people have to 
come into their legislature and seek the assistance of the official 
opposition to have timely treatment for themselves and for their 
children. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s not so much what I object to; it’s what the 
people of Saskatchewan demand, and that’s leadership in health 
care. Will the minister take that leadership and tell the Wipf 
family that their daughter’s treatment will be approved? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(10:30) 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I respect and value the 
professionals who are working on this particular file. I know 
they have great concern for this patient and for all the patients 
that they work for. And that is appropriate for how we can 
proceed with this particular kind of case. 



June 4, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1407 

I fully expect that this procedure will take place, but it’s 
appropriate that we get the information so that we know exactly 
what’s going to be paid for by the taxpayers of the province. 
That’s what we end up having to do on many of these cases, 
and we’ll continue to do that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s important, it’s important that we remember 
that we’re all trying to work within the dollars that we have. 
And one of the challenges that we clearly have has been raised 
by these members every day — by petitions, by questions — is 
spend the dollars in my community. Well every dollars that we 
spend for care other places isn’t spent here. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 

Emergency Room Service at the Border Health Centre 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the 
Minister of Health. On November 9, 1997, Jeff Onerheim and 
his three children were involved in a head-on collision five 
miles from the village of Climax. Jeff suffered multiple 
fractures of the leg, arm, pelvis, ribs as well as a collapsed lung 
and a bruised spleen. Jeff’s three-year-old daughter Brandi was 
knocked unconscious in that accident and suffered serious head 
injuries and also injuries to her shoulders and face. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the family recently wrote to the Minister of Health 
to tell him about the quick response that had been provided by 
the emergency department at the Border Health Centre in 
Climax — this same health centre where the NDP (New 
Democratic Party) is planning to cut emergency service hours 
of operation. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Jeff and Tina Onerheim want to know what the 
minister thinks is worth more — the lives of people in that area 
or the money the NDP will save by cutting back emergency 
health service. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, this question is exactly the 
issue we have in this province. It’s exactly the issue we have in 
this country. And people have to make choices around how to 
provide the best kinds of care we can. 
 
I know that the Chair of the board and the board for the Cypress 
Health Region working together with their CEO (chief 
executive officer) and working together with the people in 
Climax and Frontier and other communities that are south of the 
Frenchman River there . . . or creek — they’re all trying to sort 
out how do we provide these kinds of care. One of the 
challenges we have down in that area is getting sufficient staff 
to cover that area. Also we end up having to work with 
Shaunavon and Eastend and the facilities are there. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, that’s exactly the kind of questions that’s 
there. It’s one that we have to work at, and we have to work at 
together. I urge the members opposite to vote for our budget, 
$173 million more for Health. 
 
 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, one of the children involved in 
that terrible accident in 1997 is sitting in the gallery here this 
morning. Dustin Onerheim was five years old at the time of the 
accident. And his mother wrote to the minister saying that the 
outcome of that particular incident could have been much worse 
if not for the services provided by the doctor and the nurses at 
the Climax health centre. 
 
Will the minister explain to Dustin and his family why saving a 
few thousand dollars — and that’s what we’re talking about, 
Mr. Speaker — is more important than providing emergency 
medical services that likely saved the lives of Dustin’s father 
and sister, especially in view of the isolated nature of that 
region? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, this once again illustrates 
the challenge that we have . . . is to provide good medical 
assistance right across the province. And frankly one of the 
debates comes about whether you should end up with full 
emergency medical services and having those people available 
in very short time period right across the province as opposed to 
having facilities. 
 
And one of the challenges we end up having to do is we have to 
work with facilities. We have to work with the emergency 
medical services. We have to work with the overall system that 
we have in this province. And there’s no question that there’s 
no amount of dollars that can talk about a person’s life or a 
person’s leg or anything else that’s involved. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, what I want and what I urge the members 
opposite to be part of is a discussion around how we use the 
dollars that we have — 173 million new in this budget — to 
make sure we provide care right across the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, the community of Climax 
currently has a doctor. The community of Climax currently has 
sufficient nurses to meet their needs. The government has just 
introduced legislation regarding changes to The Ambulance Act 
that is going to put at threat the very existence of the only 
ambulance that serves that area down there. Mr. Speaker, this 
situation is not something that can be taken out of context. The 
context is very real in terms of the lives of people. 
 
Mr. Speaker, just seven weeks ago Tanelle Korsberg suffered a 
serious choking episode at her school in Frontier. Tanelle was 
rushed to the Border Health Centre in Climax in a 
semi-conscious state, and it progressed into severe neurological 
shock due to lack of oxygen. She was unresponsive and had a 
blood pressure reading of 30 over 10. The minister will be 
aware of this emergency because Tanelle’s parents have written 



1408 Saskatchewan Hansard June 4, 2004 

a letter to him. 
 
In that letter, Mr. Speaker, Terry and Merlyne Korsberg said, 
and I’d like to quote: 
 

It is without a doubt that this child did not have the 
forty-five minutes it would have taken . . . to get to 
Shaunavon . . . She could have been someone that society 
would have had to look after for the rest of her life or 
worse, we . . . (might) have lost our daughter. 
 

Mr. Speaker, the question: why is the NDP gambling with the 
lives of people in the Frontier, Climax area by restricting 
emergency service hours at the Border Health Centre? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the Cypress Health Region 
is working to provide the emergency services across that whole 
area. It’s not going to be exactly the same as it was before. Our 
hope is that it will be better. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, the real issue here is, where are those 
members when it comes to supporting dollars for health care? 
Are you going to vote for the provincial sales tax because we 
need more dollars for health care? Are you going to vote for the 
budget which adds $173 million for health care? 
 
Mr. Speaker, there have been continual demands on that side 
for more this, more that, more this. We end up all having to 
work together to make sure we have the most effective use of 
our dollars so that we can provide for people who need 
out-of-country care, so that we can provide for people who need 
care in some of the remote areas of our province. And we will 
continue to do that, and we’ll do it by making choices which 
aren’t always easy. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, the minister talked about possibly 
providing better service to that area. Mr. Speaker, I’m not sure 
how he hopes to achieve that by putting the practice of the 
current doctor at risk by cutting back hours of service at the 
Border Health Centre. I don’t know how he plans to achieve 
that by putting at risk the existence of the only ambulance that 
serves those two communities. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Terry and Merlyne Korsberg are thankful for the 
excellent and quick health service they received just seven 
weeks ago at Border Health Centre in their daughter’s time of 
crisis. And the Korsberg family, along with every other family 
in the Frontier, Climax area believe that, and I want to quote 
again: 
 

. . . my family and the residents of this vast, isolated area 
are entitled to lifesaving measures in a reasonable amount 
of time. 

 
Mr. Speaker, does the Minister of Health agree, and, if so, why 

is the NDP government cutting emergency service hours at the 
Border Health Centre in Climax? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I do agree with that 
comment that we will provide emergency services across the 
province. One of the challenges, though, is how you do that. 
 
And it’s clear that at some of the facilities that we have, there 
aren’t sufficient staff. There aren’t sufficient people to provide 
that kind of care, and it ends up being that we’ll end up with 
some regional centres. And in this case it may be Shaunavon 
that’ll provide that care. Or my goal is to continue to provide 
services in that Climax area but do it in a way that is sustainable 
over the long term. 
 
And that’s a real challenge because you end up having to deal 
with not only the health issues, you have to deal with the local 
economic issues and education issues — many other issues. 
And those are exactly the kinds of issues that I talked with the 
people from Climax and Frontier because they want to build in 
that part of the province, and we do too.

Severance Package for Health Region 
Former Chief Executive Officer 

 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, the Health minister talks about 
funding issues and funding crisis. Mr. Speaker, the people in 
Saskatoon are shocked and surprised at the $66,000 so-called 
severance package being paid for health region CEO Jim 
Ferguson. It seems strange to call this a severance package 
because he wasn’t fired, and in fact he still has a contract with 
the Saskatoon Health Region. 
 
People are asking, Mr. Speaker, how can you resign, get a large 
severance payment, and still continue working for the same 
employer? Mr. Speaker, my question is, is that not 
double-dipping? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the CEO positions in health 
care in our province, but right across the country are extremely 
demanding positions. And people will take these jobs and . . . 
but they end up with contracts that will provide certain kinds of 
things. In this particular instance the regional health authority in 
Saskatoon has negotiated a way out of the contract that was 
there for Mr. Ferguson, and it includes a three-month severance 
package, but there are also some kinds of assistance that can be 
provided by Mr. Ferguson as he goes into his semi-retirement. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, we’re going to continue to work and support 
what happens in the regional health authorities because we 
know that they need to get the best people possible to run the 
facilities and the operations that we have. 



June 4, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1409 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, the Health minister is well aware 
of the concept of working notice, and he knows full well that he 
would be able to have Mr. Ferguson provide services during 
that notice period. At a time that money is so tight and the 
health system is facing significant cuts, people in Saskatoon are 
having a hard time understanding this severance payment, 
particularly when Mr. Ferguson is now under a new contract 
with the health district. What’s even worse is that they are 
refusing to disclose the terms of this contract. We don’t know 
what Mr. Ferguson will be doing for the health district, and we 
don’t know how much he will be paid while he is receiving that 
severance payment. 
 
Mr. Speaker, can the minister provide to us today the terms of 
reference for this 12-month consulting contract and how much 
Mr. Ferguson will be being paid on top of the $66,000 
severance payment? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the Saskatoon Health 
Authority and the board have been working to have an orderly 
transition in that Authority, because it’s clearly the biggest 
health authority in the province. And they’re going to do that in 
a way that allows for Mr. Ferguson to go with thanks for lots of 
work well done over many, many years, but also while making 
sure that he can help out in the transition. 
 
There will be a national search for a new CEO and that will take 
a number of months. We have one of the vice-presidents that 
will be taking over to run the operation in the meantime. And 
we will continue to support the Saskatoon Health Authority as 
they provide crucial services for the whole province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, there is something seriously 
wrong with a health system that puts the priorities in the wrong 
order. Mr. Speaker, what they’ve done is they’ve said they’re 
recognizing the value of this employee — and I have no issue 
with that — but what the problem is, is that they are ignoring 
the fact that they cannot approve the treatment to save a little 
girl’s leg. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why all the secrecy about this? This is taxpayers’ 
money. Taxpayers deserve an answer, Mr. Speaker. Why is Mr. 
Ferguson getting severance when he is still under contract? 
What are the terms of this contract? How much is he getting 
paid? And how much money could they have used to save this 
little girl’s leg rather than make this kind of a payment, Mr. 
Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, it’s unfortunate that my 
learned colleague uses that kind of language around this 
particular situation. We have $2.7 billion in the health care 
system to provide services right across the province, and we’re 
working on the issue related to the little girl who needs some 
care. 
 
But we also recognize that we need to have good leadership in 
all of our health authorities across the province. And we’re 
going to support the board and the Chair of the board and others 
who are working on these particular issues, because their job is 
to make sure that the whole system runs for the benefit of all the 
people in the province. And they’re going to continue to do that. 
 
There will be a national search for a new CEO in Saskatoon, 
and we look forward to supporting a new person who can 
continue the good work done by Mr. Ferguson.

Strategic Plan for Crown Investments Corporation 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question is 
for the minister responsible for Crown Investments 
Corporation. Yesterday the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting 
Corporation) acquired a copy of CIC’s (Crown Investments 
Corporation of Saskatchewan) three-year strategic plan through 
a freedom of information request. The document states one of 
CIC’s strategic objectives is, and I quote: “The Crown sector 
provides high-quality goods and services at a competitive rate.” 

 
The NDP government approved the plan in July 2003, just three 
months before the 2003 election and just a few weeks before the 
Premier claimed Saskatchewan had the lowest cost package of 
utilities in Canada — a fact, Mr. Speaker, that was not true — 
and made an election promise to continue to have the lowest. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why would the Premier make an election promise 
that his . . . a promise that his own government’s three-year 
strategic plan clearly indicates the NDP never had any intention 
of keeping. 
 
The Speaker: — Order. I just would ask . . . caution the 
member about impugning intentions in his statements. Order. I 
recognize the Minister of the Crown Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
John Weidlich, the CBC reporter applied for, under access to 
information, the strategic plan for the Crown Investment 
Corporation. That was released to him. That document was 
approved by the CIC board in early 2003; it was published in 
the summer of 2003. 
 
And obviously the Premier of Saskatchewan made an 
announcement last fall about our vision for the Crown sector in 
the province, where our vision would have the lowest bundle of 
utility rates in the country, where we would stagger our annual 
reports, where we would have a third party review for external 
investments, and that we would report annually to the people of 



1410 Saskatchewan Hansard June 4, 2004 

Saskatchewan how our Crown sector is doing. Mr. Speaker, 
we’re implementing all of those commitments by the Premier. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Premier 
approved CIC’s three-year strategic plan in July 2003, and it 
called for competitive utility rates. But three weeks later the 
Premier claimed he had the lowest rates, and then he made an 
election promise to have the lowest rates into the future. Mr. 
Speaker, the NDP’s own three-year strategic plan says the 
objective will be competitive rates. 
 
And the document also says the Crown should, and I quote, 
“advance the perception.” Advance the perception of what, Mr. 
Speaker? That what the Premier says is true even though it’s 
clearly not? 
 
The Premier’s campaign promise is all smoke, mirrors, and 
pixie dust. Why would the Premier make an election promise of 
the lowest utility rate package in Canada, when he knew it was 
absolutely no plan in place to deliver that promise? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of the Crown 
Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Well, Mr. Speaker, it’s obvious that the 
members opposite are running out of questions, Mr. Speaker, 
and that’s why we see the member from Cannington getting up 
and trying to . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order. Order. Order 
please, members. I recognize the Minister of the Crown 
Management Board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Well it’s obvious that members 
opposite are running out of questions because they’re 
continuing to flog this dead horse, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
what I have said and what we’ve said continuously since the 
election of last fall is that Saskatchewan is going to provide the 
lowest bundle of utility rates in the country. 
 
We’ve said we’re going to report annually to the public how our 
Crown sector is doing. We’ve said, Mr. Speaker, that we are 
going to do a third party review of external investment. 
 
Now I know, Mr. Minister, that the members opposite still can’t 
get over the fact that the Crown sector was a major public 
policy issue in the last provincial election. Their position lost; 
our position won. They were on the wrong side of the issue, and 
they continue to be on the wrong side of the issue. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the member for Melfort on his feet? 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — With leave, Mr. Speaker, to extend question 
period for 25 minutes. 
 

The Speaker: — Order, please. Order please, members. The 
member for Melfort has respectfully requested an extension of 
oral question period. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — No. 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Order. I interpret that to be a 
denial of leave. Leave has not been granted. 
 
Order. Order, members. Order. Order. Order.
