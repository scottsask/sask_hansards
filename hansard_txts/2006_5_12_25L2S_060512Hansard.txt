Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I rise 
again today to present a petition on behalf of individuals from 
the constituency of Cypress Hills concerned about the condition 
of Highway No. 18, particularly the stretch from Claydon to 
Robsart, although I understand Highway 18 right across the 
province has some difficulties. The prayer reads as follows: 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to cause the government to take 
the necessary actions to ensure that Highway 18 from 
Claydon to Robsart is repaved at the earliest possible time 
to ensure the safety of drivers in the area and so that 
economic development opportunities are not lost. 
 
As in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray.

it’s a rather long petition so I’ll just read part of the prayer. It is 
signed by people who are concerned that in Saskatchewan the 
number of children being diagnosed with ASD [autism 
spectrum disorder] is high — as high as 1 in 251. A portion of 
the prayer reads: 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to act upon the following 
recommendation made February 2005 by the Government 
of Saskatchewan caucus committee on human services to 
the Saskatchewan Minister of Health. 
 

Madam Speaker, two of the recommendations are: 
 

To ensure that ASD adult services and supports are 
accessible and based on need rather than on IQ or physical 
disability, and secondly, to encourage and support 
autism-related research in Saskatchewan. 

 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray.

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of 
Agriculture and Food. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam 
Speaker, it’s my privilege today to introduce to you and to all 
members of the Assembly a number of guests who are seated in 
your gallery. These guests are partners in the prairie 
conservation action plan, known as PCAP, and they are here to 
mark Native Prairie Appreciation Week which will be observed 
next month from June 18 to 24. Madam Speaker, the purpose of 
the week is to raise awareness of the importance of native 
prairies to Saskatchewan’s agriculture and environmental 
sectors. 
 
It is my pleasure to introduce to you and through you to the 
members of the Assembly the chairperson of PCAP, Mr. 
Michael Burgess of the Saskatchewan Stock Growers 
Association. With Mr. Burgess today are members of the PCAP 
board, Ms. Karyn Scalisc, Mr. Orin Balas . . . oh sorry. I should 
just say Karyn is the manager, Orin Balas is with the 
Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association. Mr. Joel Peterson of 
Ducks Unlimited, Mr. Michael Champion of the Native Plant 
Society of Saskatchewan Inc., Mr. Jordan Ignatiuk of the

The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats.

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

Mr. Iwanchuk: — Madam Deputy Speaker, to you and through 
you to the Assembly, I want to introduce in the west gallery

and 8 students. Their teachers are Mr. Chaisson, Mr. Pritchard, 
and Mrs. Jasper. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, some of the best fun nights I’ve had, 
they have been at Father Vachon School in there. So I want to 
welcome them and ask all the members to welcome these 
special visitors to our Assembly. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member from 
Moosomin. 
 

Reflecting on Mother’s Day 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, this coming Sunday we will again take a 
moment to honour our mothers as we celebrate Mother’s Day. I 
trust however, Madam Deputy Speaker, that this is not the only 
day when we pause to reflect on the gift of our mothers. And I 
might add if it wasn’t for mothers, many of us wouldn’t be 
sitting here today. I’m certain that everyone in this room has 
fond memories of coming home from a tough day at school. 
 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1637 

Madam Deputy Speaker, as we think about mothers and we 
look around the room and we must pause to also be mindful of 
the fact that many mothers across this province put up with a 
lot. And for that we say thank you. They put up with pranks. 
They put with issues of where we haven’t been, as individuals 
haven’t listened very carefully. But, you know, we all have fond 
memories of our mothers. 
 
I remember coming home — and many members will probably 
reflect on this — coming home from school and walking into 
the house or running into the house and to the smell of fresh 
baking, dinner on the stove, and your mother welcoming you 
and wanting to know how your day went. And then reminding 
you that there were chores to do before dinner but also saying 
before you go out to do your chores, have a fresh bun and a 
glass of milk. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, mothers are very special people. We 
want to take this moment to just say thank you to all of the 
mothers across our province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[10:30] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Regina 
Elphinstone-Centre. 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. Honoré de Balzac once wrote, “A mother who is really 
a mother is never free.” It is important for us to remember this, 
Mr. Speaker, as we approach Mother’s Day. 
 
This Sunday is a day set aside for those women in our lives that 
affect us most — our mothers. There is only one official day 
every year by which we try to show appreciation for the 
mothers who have dedicated their lives to us, their children. 
 
Mr. Speaker, for the first years of our lives mother may be the 
only word that we can say. In truth, no matter where we go or 
who we become, our mothers are never very far from our 
thoughts. We carry their lessons with us. They nurture and 
guide us always. 
 
Mr. Speaker, mothers are those women in society who do not 
occupy a single role; they occupy all roles. A mother is at once 
a sage, teacher, cheerleader, seamstress, carpenter, 
horticulturalist, rocket scientist, but, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
that is not all. 
 
As Ann Taylor once wrote, mothers are also routinely 
physicians, and I quote: 
 

Who ran to help me when I fell, 
And who would some pretty story tell, 
Or who would kiss the place to make it well? 
My Mother. 

 
Mr. Speaker, may all mothers have a very happy Mother’s Day. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Estevan. 

Women Entrepreneurs Week 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. May 8 to 
14 is Women Entrepreneurs Week in Saskatchewan. This week 
was designated to mark the specific contributions of women in 
business to the economy of our province. 
 
As can be evidenced in our educational institutions and in our 
workforces, women are taking more prominent positions in 
Saskatchewan professions and in Saskatchewan businesses. 
Thanks to the many positive role models that have become their 
own boss in the past few decades, more and more women are 
choosing to venture out on their own and become independent 
business women. 
 
And just last week, Madam Deputy Speaker, at the Women of 
Distinction Awards and dinner here in Regina, we saw the 
successes of many women in the Regina area. And prior to that 
I witnessed the Women of Today Awards in Estevan, where we 
celebrated the achievements of many of our role models from 
that community. 
 
And just in our province alone, women entrepreneurs have 
created in excess of 600 full-time jobs for Saskatchewan 
people. Madam Deputy Speaker, we should all be thankful for 
the hard work and dedication of all our women entrepreneurs in 
this province. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Eastview. 
 

Licensed Practical Nurses Day 
 
Ms. Junor: — Thank you. Madam Deputy Speaker, tomorrow, 
May 13, is Licensed Practical Nurses Day. LPNs play an 
important and valued role on our health care teams. We are 
fortunate in Saskatchewan to have highly skilled practical 
nurses, committed to providing the best possible care to their 
patients. I know all members will join me in acknowledging 
their achievements. LPNs are devoted and dedicated to the 
people who need their expertise and compassion, and the people 
of Saskatchewan trust them and hold them in high esteem. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, earlier this week we recognized May 8 
to 19 as national nurses’ week. As I acknowledged then, nurses, 
like many other health care providers, are currently in short 
supply around the world. Here in Saskatchewan we are 
addressing this issue in our Working Together: Saskatchewan’s 
Health Workforce Action Plan released this past December. The 
strategy is a comprehensive, detailed plan designed to improve 
health care in Saskatchewan by keeping and attracting health 
care professionals, and was developed in consultation with 
nursing organizations and other health provider groups. Already 
our workforce action plan is recognized as a national standard 
and is being praised for its innovative health care planning. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of this government and all 
Saskatchewan residents, I’d like to thank all licensed practical 
nurses for their commitment to high-quality nursing care. We 
value the contribution they make and join them in celebrating 
this special day.

The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Kelvington-Wadena. 
 

Celebrating Thorrablót 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you. Saskatchewan people of Icelandic 
descent have not forgotten their ancestors’ heritage, and 
recently held a 25th anniversary of Thorrablót. Thorrablót is a 
major occasion in Iceland with Icelanders attending many 
fantastic celebrations. In Saskatchewan it includes a buffet 
dinner, Icelandic desserts, a short cultural program, dancing, 
visiting, and another lunch of Icelandic food. 
 
The Vatnabyggð Club was formed May 13, 1981. In June of 
that year . . . and became a chapter of the Icelandic National 
League. Vatnabyggð, which means lake settlements, were 
chosen to represent the whole settlement area from Dafoe to 
Foam Lake along Highway 16 and north and south of Highway 
No. 35. 
 
The 25th anniversary event which was held in Wynyard saw 
more than 180 attendees from the area as well as from Kelliher, 
Yorkton, Melville, Simpson, Warman, Moose Jaw, Saskatoon, 
Regina, Manitoba, Calgary, Ontario, and Brazil. 
 
As part of the celebration, Örn Jónsson, consul for Iceland in 
Saskatchewan, attended and commented that Vatnabyggð is 
now a must destination for Icelandic visitors. Also in attendance 
for the first time was Iceland’s ambassador to Canada, Markús 
Örn Antonsson, and his wife, Steinunn, who at the end of the 
tour commented, “I’ve seen many signs of Icelandic successes 
in this new country.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d ask this Assembly to join with me in 
congratulating the Vatnabyggð Icelanders on their 25th 
anniversary Thorrablót. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Regina Walsh 
Acres. 
 

Women Entrepreneurs Week 
 
Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, May 8 to 14 is Women Entrepreneurs Week 
here in Saskatchewan, a time set aside to recognize the very 
significant contributions that business and professional women 
make to the province’s economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, 
Saskatchewan’s economy is driven in no small measure by the 
vision, drive, hard work, and innovation of women 
entrepreneurs. Last year women entrepreneurs owned and 
operated approximately one-third of all Saskatchewan 
businesses. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, Women Entrepreneurs of 
Saskatchewan is a non-profit organization with almost 800 
members across the province. Last year alone this organization 
responded to over 2,300 enquiries and almost 70,000 visits to 
its website. 
 
Since its inception, Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan has 

provided more than $12 million in loans to help women start, 
expand, or purchase existing businesses in the province and has 
leveraged over $9 million more. This financing has helped 
provide business advice, mentoring, and training opportunities, 
and, Madam Deputy Speaker, it has helped businesswomen 
create more than 640 full-time jobs right here in the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, this week provides us with the 
opportunity to celebrate the commitment and achievements of 
Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan. I ask all members to 
join me in saluting their contributions to the province and the 
valuable programs that Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan 
provides. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Wood 
River. 
 

Government’s Advertising Campaign 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Madam Deputy Speaker, a couple of 
days ago the NDP [New Democratic Party] government 
launched an advertising campaign to promote the fact that they 
finally adopted the Saskatchewan Party plan to reduce business 
taxes, not a bad idea really since the ads are going to be run in 
other provinces and since they don’t feature the Minister of 
Finance in his leadership bid. 
 
But once again the NDP managed to screw it up. If you go to 
their website, thinksask.ca, there’s a video featuring various 
people talking about doing business in Saskatchewan. 
Strangely, one of the spokespeople in the video is from 
Weyerhaeuser. That’s the same Weyerhaeuser that just shut 
down its mill in Prince Albert and put hundreds of people out of 
work. And on top of that, the Weyerhaeuser spokesman 
featured in the ad is now retired and living in BC [British 
Columbia]. Madam Deputy Speaker, this makes about as much 
sense as getting Henry Burris to make a recruitment video for 
the Riders. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, just to recap: Weyerhaeuser closed 
down its plant in Saskatchewan, laid off hundreds of workers, 
and its spokesman moved to BC. Is this really the best example 
the NDP could find of company doing business in NDP 
Saskatchewan? Madam Deputy Speaker, just another example 
of the NDP government has a distinct lack of credibility. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Availability of Intensive Care in Saskatoon Hospitals 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I read 
with concern this morning about the story of Lana Van 
Elsakker. She was sent by air ambulance to Calgary due to the 
possibility of a premature labour. Lana spent a week in the 
hospital in Calgary before being discharged. She was still and is 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1639 

still pregnant. This woman was flown to Calgary by air 
ambulance but offered no way to get to back home. Doctors in 
Calgary didn’t want her to drive back home in case she went 
into labour. Lana had to hitch a ride with her relatives to get 
back home. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, this government always talks about no 
one being left behind. How come Lana was left behind? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. I read the same article this morning in the newspaper 
that the member refers to. I might say that I have no other 
information about this case other than that newspaper article. 
The family did not contact us. The Saskatoon Health Region 
has in fact made themselves available to the family should they 
wish to discuss the circumstances that the young woman found 
herself in. Madam Deputy Speaker, to my knowledge to this 
point, the family has not yet taken up the offer to speak with the 
quality care coordinator. But that offer still stands. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, medical decisions are being made in 
intensive care units around this province every single day. 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I’m sorry that the woman and her 
family are frustrated with the circumstances. But I’m very 
pleased, Madam Speaker, that we have processes in place . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you. This woman was left in the 
lurch out of this province with no way to get home. Hers is not 
an isolated case however. In fact it appears that it’s starting to 
become a pattern with this NDP government. 
 
According to the Saskatoon Health District, since January, 
seven expectant mothers have been flown out of Saskatoon to 
hospitals in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Regina. Clearly 
we have a serious problem here that this Health minister has not 
addressed. Expectant mothers should be able to receive 
emergency treatment in our largest city in times of need. 
 
Mr. Speaker, how come this minister has not funded the 
expansion of the neonatal intensive care unit in the Saskatoon 
hospital? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. As I was saying earlier before I ran out of time, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I’m very pleased that the system is 
designed to ensure that the care of people who are in intensive 
care circumstances are being dealt with, that we have the 
policies in place, the guidelines in place to protect the safety of 
individuals like the mother and the yet-to-be-born child. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, Saskatchewan Health and the 
Saskatoon Health Region have been working on plans with 

regards to the neonatal intensive care unit for quite some time. 
This week, this week, Madam Deputy Speaker, Saskatchewan 
Health has received requests to review the plans that have been 
developed by the Saskatoon Health Region. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, every time we’ve brought forward 
plans for funding in this House, under the budget, the members 
of the Sask Party opposite have voted against it. We continue to 
support programs that are necessary in this province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The 
CEO [chief executive officer] of the Saskatoon Health District 
has been complaining about this issue for months. Maura 
Davies said that this unit is too small and outmoded for the 
number of sick babies and the modern equipment needed to 
deal with their issues. Pregnant women are being forced to 
leave the province because this NDP government is not funding 
health care properly. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why is the largest health district in the province 
being forced to deal with outdated, cramped facilities when, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, more is needed in that district? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. The member opposite has forgotten a couple of things. 
Number one, Saskatchewan also takes care of people from 
Alberta, Manitoba, and British Columbia when they have 
overcapacity problems and their people need to be taken care 
of. We have reciprocal agreements with the other provinces, 
and we share the capacities that we have when we have it, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Secondly, the member opposite forgets the commitments that 
have been made and delivered in the Saskatoon Health Region 
recently: the opening of the Irene and Les Dubé cancer care 
centre at City Hospital; the brand new cataract catheterization 
lab at Royal University Hospital; the opening of the brand new 
West Winds Primary care centre in Saskatoon’s west side; and 
yesterday, Madam Deputy Speaker, $2.3 million linear 
accelerator Saskatchewan cancer care centre in Saskatoon, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The 
Minister of Health is hollering from his seat, why didn’t we 
support the budget? 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, when it takes $500,000 to promote his 
leadership campaign, this opposition will vote against that 
budget every single time. Madam Deputy Speaker, it costs 



1640 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2006 

$700,000 to do the renovations that this hospital needs. But 
unfortunately . . . 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Order. Order. Other members will 
have an opportunity to enter debate. I ask all hon. members to 
respect the member on his feet. The member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
[10:45] 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Madam Deputy Speaker, it costs $700,000 
to have a properly equipped and enough space for a neonatal 
unit in Saskatoon. But unfortunately that Finance minister finds 
it more important for self-promotion than the care of infants in 
our province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McMorris: — I find that appalling. When will this 
government put its priorities straight, quit advertising his 
leadership campaign, and fund hospitals in this province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. Interesting debate taking place in the House right now, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. We have the single largest capital 
budget for health in many, many years — a 20 per cent 
increase, a 20 per cent increase in capital funding over last year. 
Madam Deputy Speaker, that’s going to fund enhancements all 
over this province: new hospitals in Swift Current, continuing 
funding in Humboldt, continuing funding in Preeceville, 
continuing funding in other locations across this province, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
And indeed that party, the Saskatchewan Party, and that 
member did not support any one of them at the time the budget 
was brought down, Madam Deputy Speaker. We will continue 
our commitments on capital and supporting Saskatchewan 
people. Madam Deputy Speaker, I encourage the members 
opposite to reconsider their votes and support 10 per cent 
increases overall in health care. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 

Disposal of Biomedical Waste 
 
Mr. Hart: — Madam Deputy Speaker, earlier this week the 
Minister of the Environment indicated that or said that he was 
aware of biomedical waste being found in the Saskatoon 
landfill. The minister indicated that a couple of bags of sharps 
and some blood products had been found. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, can the Minister of Environment tell 
this Assembly what follow-up he has done in this case? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of the Environment. 
 

Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. This 
matter has been dealt with by the officials in the Saskatoon 
area. It relates to some of the disposal of medical waste from 
the Saskatoon area. It’s been looked at and being dealt with by 
Saskatchewan Environment, by the Saskatchewan health 
region, and by the waste disposal companies that are involved 
with providing the proper placement of these particular items. 
 
And there was a particular issue as it relates to a couple of bags 
of medical waste and that particular issue is being dealt with. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Madam Deputy Speaker, biomedical wastes are 
classified under the environmental protection Act as hazardous 
wastes. They pose a threat to those people who handle them, 
those people who find them. The minister has not told us if he 
knows where the wastes originated from, what they’re doing to 
find out where they came from. He’s leaving it up to private 
companies to deal with it. 
 
Has he provided any directions to prevent this occurring in the 
future? And has he given any directions as to . . . and is he 
looking at improving the system in this province whereby we 
deal with biomedical wastes? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of the Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The 
province of Saskatchewan has a committee of people who look 
at the overall disposal of biomedical waste across the province, 
and they are continuing to work and develop. There are 
procedures that are set out. There are regulations about how 
biomedical waste should be dealt with. And many times that 
also fits in with some of the waste management companies 
which have policies themselves as to how they dispose of 
biomedical waste. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, this is an area where Saskatchewan 
Environment, working together with Saskatchewan Health and 
with some municipalities and private companies, has been and 
continues to provide a very safe way of disposing of biomedical 
waste. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member from Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Madam Deputy Speaker, this is not the first 
occurrence of biomedical wastes ending up in the landfill site. 
Back in the year 2000, such wastes were found in the Regina 
landfill site. Now we hear about biomedical wastes ending up in 
the Saskatoon landfill sites. These are the two cases that we 
know about. The question is, how many more incidents like this 
are happening that we don’t know about? 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, last year when that minister was the 
Minister of Health, he had an opportunity to move 
Saskatchewan to lead the world in dealing with biomedical 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1641 

waste. There’s a business right here in Regina that has 
cutting-edge technology. And all they asked the minister to do 
is provide them with the opportunity to do a test run on their 
machine that uses ozone to neutralize biomedical waste. 
 
And, Madam Deputy Speaker, that minister did nothing to 
move this along. Now we have an incident of biomedical waste 
ending up in the Saskatoon landfill sites. How many more 
incidents like this do we need to occur before that minister 
actually does something to deal with this situation? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of the Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. As 
minister of Health, I’m very aware of the proposal that the 
member has been talking about. I know that it has been 
reviewed by various officials within the Government of 
Saskatchewan and also within various municipalities and as it 
relates to a number of the waste disposal companies. I 
encourage that member to encourage the business involved to 
make sure he continues to work with the appropriate people to 
try to make sure that if his product will fit within a 
Saskatchewan situation, it can be done that way. 
 
But, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have a plan for Saskatchewan 
that involves Saskatchewan Environment and Saskatchewan 
Health, municipalities, and the various private waste disposal 
companies in this province. And we are going to continue to 
work to make sure we have the best disposal for all types of 
waste within our province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 

Tracking Children’s School Attendance 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Madam Deputy Speaker, earlier this week the 
Saskatchewan Party brought up the distressing issue of children 
not in school. According to the minister, right now there are 
1,500 children not in school in the city of Saskatoon. And, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, if there are 1,500 children out of 
school just in Saskatoon, there must be a similar number in 
Regina. This number gets higher and higher when you look at it 
province-wide, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
To the minister: how many years has the department known 
about this incredibly high number of children not in school? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Learning. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Madam Deputy Speaker, this number is 
an estimate, and while the estimate runs from 1,000 to 1,500, 
the member of course is using the high end of the estimate. 
We’re dealing with early statistics, and we are working on a 
pilot project that is in place in the city of Saskatoon. 
 
We hope to have, by this fall, the program to be province-wide. 
We will have more accurate numbers, more definite numbers at 
that time. Currently we’re working on issues of including all 

schools. The program is working well, and we expect to have 
more definite numbers later this fall. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Madam Deputy Speaker, the question was, 
how many years had she known about the problem? 
 
The minister admitted, after the opposition raised this issue, that 
a tracking program had been in place for some years. The 
minister has known that 1,500 children, and by some estimates 
it’s substantially higher than that . . . that they have known that 
this problem exists. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, the NDP believes that no child should 
be left behind. But unfortunately, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
these children are being left behind. Madam Deputy Speaker, 
what is this minister going to do to address the problem of 
children not in school? What is she going to do to make sure 
that no child is left behind? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Learning. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, the 
Government of Saskatchewan and the Department of Learning 
has been working on this the last number of years. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite stands up and talks with 
some shock and dismay that this is the number of children that 
the estimate . . . estimation of number of children that are out of 
the school system. I would ask the member opposite, what did 
he do when he was the Chair of the Saskatoon School Division? 
Nothing. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, we are looking at this problem. We 
are working with the school divisions to put a program in place 
that will track children, and we are seeing good results initially. 
And we expect to have the program province-wide this fall. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Madam Deputy Speaker, when I was on the 
school board, this issue was raised with the Department of 
Learning. The Saskatoon Public School Board continues to 
raise this issue with the Department of Learning so that they can 
develop the appropriate tracking model to ensure that this 
model, that this number does not continue, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
How many years has this minister known about it? And for how 
many years has this minister chose to do nothing about it? Is 
this minister intervening in any way to ensure that these 
children get back into school? Is she developing any kind of a 
program to ensure that these children are not left behind, 
Madam Deputy Speaker? 



1642 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2006 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Learning. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, while the 
member opposite was writing letters, this Department of 
Learning and this government was taking action. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Whether it’s community schools, 
alternative schools, putting in place pre-kindergarten programs, 
supports for parents, support for learners that need special 
attention, Madam Deputy Speaker, we’ve gone beyond writing 
letters, and we are putting action and programs in place. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Saskatoon 
Southeast. 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Madam Deputy Speaker, I’d like to quote 
from the Learning minister’s scrum earlier this week. Here is 
her answer when a reporter asked, what can be done to address 
this? Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, her answer was, “Not 
much at this time.” 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, the minister says that nothing can be 
done. But in reality, her NDP government can certainly do 
something. They can at least tell us how many kids are not in 
school, and not sweep this problem under the rug. We are 
dealing with children, our most precious resource here. We 
don’t have the luxury of time to wait and see. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, will this minister do something about 
this distressing issue? Will she commit to maintaining a 
comprehensive database identifying these children? Will she 
commit today to a program that will get these children back into 
school? Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Learning. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Madam Deputy Speaker, we have done a 
great deal of work on a system that will track students, but there 
are many issues. Keeping a database isn’t the only solution. We 
need to build strong relationships with children, with families to 
make sure those supports are in place, and there is a connection 
to learning and a connection to the education system. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, community schools, pre-kindergarten 
programs — which are very important— and also the early 
learning and child care program. We had a substantial plan 
which the federal government pulled out funding on. And this 
provincial government has made the intention known. We will 
continue on with our plan, and we will continue to build those 
connections and those bridges to families and to young students 
so that connection to education and learning begins early in 
their life. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Moosomin. 
 

Child Hunger and Poverty 
 
Mr. Toth: — Madam Deputy Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister of Community Services. According to the Canadian 
Association of Food Banks’ annual hunger count, food bank in 
this province is up six one-half per cent. The report, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, also indicated that over 11,000 children were 
members of families that relied on food banks regularly for 
their food requirements. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, this NDP government once promised 
to eliminate food banks. That hasn’t happened. In fact child 
hunger is more serious today than it ever was. Madam Deputy 
Speaker, question to the minister is this: why are hungry 
children being left behind by this NDP government? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of 
Community Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
The only question that I have for the opposition that cry every 
now and then . . . First of all, there’s been dramatic 
improvements. We know that the use of the food bank in 
Saskatoon is down in April. We know that we have the largest 
increase in social service support systems ever in the history of 
this government and this province. And, Mr. Speaker, no matter 
how many crocodile tears are being shown across the way, they 
voted against that budget. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Well, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, this NDP party at one time said they 
would eliminate food banks. This NDP government said that 
they would eliminate hunger in the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
However, Madam Deputy Speaker, Wayne Hellquist is the 
Chair of the Canadian Association of Food Banks. He happens 
to be also the CEO of the Regina District Food Bank . . . 
 
[11:00] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Order. Order. The member should not 
need to be raising his voice to place the question; he’s close to 
the Speaker. I would ask all members to allow him to deliver 
the question. Thank you. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, Mr. Hellquist is also the CEO of the Regina 
District Food Bank and he says, and I quote: “Children are 
taking the brunt of our inability to tackle issues of hunger, 
housing, transportation, and decent family support, including 
wages and social assistance.” 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, to the minister, the question is this: 
why is this minister failing to improve the lives of hungry 
children in this province? 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1643 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Community 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, we have done a 
tremendous amount of good work. We recognize the value of 
the food bank and what a lot of people need to understand is 
that food banks nowadays play a variety of roles. And as well, 
Mr. Speaker, we have also . . . trying to make sure we have a 
variety of support programs out there to help the families in 
Saskatchewan. We have done a tremendous amount of work. 
 
This budget alone, Madam Deputy Speaker, has done a lot to 
recognize the deficiencies in Saskatchewan and addressing 
child hunger and poverty overall. We have made very, very 
good progress. And I would add again, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, all the progress that we have identified — everything 
from the rental supplement to the extra help for all the food 
banks that are out there and recognizing their role. And we’ll 
continue working away and meeting some of the other needs 
that are out there to help the families. 
 
All this work being done and all the improvements being made, 
that member and that party opposite voted against that budget. 
That is why, Madam Deputy Speaker, they have no credibility 
on any front. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Madam Deputy Speaker, the Minister of Finance 
likes to boast about his first budget. However that budget cut 
over $6 million from the child tax benefit. Madam Deputy 
Speaker, that money was supposed to help low-income families 
and children. At a time when the federal government is 
increasing its share of funding to low-income children, this 
NDP government is clawing back that contribution. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, how can he can say no child is left 
behind when that NDP government is clawing back $6 million 
that should have gone to hungry children in this province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister Responsible for 
Community Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Madam Deputy Speaker, it sounds a bit 
silly coming from that opposition when they talked about, 
several years ago under their former leader, that their solution to 
helping the poor people of . . . 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Order. Order. I ask that the member 
posing the question be heard. I would ask the same be given 
respect to the Minister of Community Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
And I’ll point out that that issue coming from that member, 
when several years under the old leader, their plan for the 
Department of Community Resources is a $50 million cut, 
Madam Deputy Speaker — $50 million they’re going to take 

off, rip out of the poor people’s budget, out of the handicapped 
people’s budget, and many other budgets. And that member was 
supportive of that motion that the Sask Party had several years 
ago. 
 
We are not going to claw back any child care benefits. We’re 
going to backfill every program that we speak about. We’re 
going to backfill that support for the poor people that the 
families need in this province. And we’re going to put our 
money where our mouth is, unlike that opposition opposite, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Well, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Finance minister’s own 
budgetary documents, the Saskatchewan child benefit is moving 
down from 7.9 million to 1.8. That’s a $6 million reduction, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, when Mr. Hellquist says that there’s 
child hunger problems in the province of Saskatchewan . . . 
food banks have not disappeared. Exactly, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, what is this government doing to address the issues of 
hungry children in the province of Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of 
Community Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Madam Deputy Speaker, we as a 
government recognize that as the child tax benefit program 
came into effect that the people of Saskatchewan have more 
room to provide more support services to the people that are 
living in poverty and the children that are suffering. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, we’re going to continue working very 
hard to meet some of that needs. This Premier and this 
government speaks of no one left behind on the path to 
opportunity. We are going to work hard to achieve that, Madam 
Deputy Speaker. And furthermore as you go along look at their 
history, look at their history. They proposed a $50 million cut. 
They proposed a different solution that are going to cost the 
people of Saskatchewan more money and hurt the people in 
poverty more. So, Madam Deputy Speaker, every time we make 
improvements, whether its a rental supplement program or 
whether it’s recognizing people with disabilities, cognitive 
disabilities — we’re recognizing them as well — every time we 
try and move forward, they vote against the budget that does 
that. 
 
So the question that I have is, all these questions, why do you 
vote against progress and why do you provide alternative plans 
that hurt the people of Saskatchewan more? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

Subvote (AG01) 
 
The Deputy Chair: — Members of the committee, we’re 
dealing with the estimates for the Department of Agriculture 
and Food this morning. And I’d like to welcome the officials 
here from that department and recognize the minister to 
introduce his officials and, if you wish, make some opening 
remarks. So I recognize the Minister of Agriculture and Food. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. The 
officials that are accompanying me here today are Deputy 
Minister Doug Matthies, who is immediately to my right. 
Behind me is Hal Cushon, assistant deputy minister. And in the 
empty chair is Jacquie Gibney . . . [inaudible interjection] . . . 
She’s not going to be here today? Okay. Oh I’ve got a revised 
list. Thank you. 
 
Rick Burton is seated in the back, director of policy branch. 
Stan Benjamin, in the last row, is general manager of the 
Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation. Beside Stan in the 
back row — two behind me — is Karen Aulie, director of 
corporate services branch. And in the back row, on the far side, 
we have Shawn Jaques, manager of customer service for Crop 
Insurance Corporation. We have, next to him, Dave Boehm, 
director of financial programs branch. And next to him is John 
Babcock, acting director of the irrigation development branch, 
and Rick Ashton is acting director of lands branch. Thank you 
very much. 
 
And basically, we’re ready for the questions. The officials are 
well-prepared, as I believe we are, and we’re looking forward to 
an informative time together. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the hon. member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair, I just 

want to take the opportunity to welcome the minister’s officials 
here this morning. And being that we have a number of people 
that want to get in and ask questions, I’d like to pass to my 
colleague this morning to start off the questioning. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the hon. member for 
Rosetown-Biggar. 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I think I just 
have one or two questions for the minister. I’m sure, Mr. 
Minister, you are aware that just two or three weeks ago there 
was a public meeting held in Conquest regarding the west side 
irrigation project, which has been on the drawing board for 30 
years now. I think the plan was discontinued, if I remember 
correctly, in 1972, so that would be over 30 years. 
 
There is renewed interest. There is a west side irrigators project, 
been re-established, chaired by Doug Ball, the former CEO of 
the Midwest Health District. There is support from the local 
municipalities. I think five local RMs [rural municipality] are 
involved. They have provided funding for an initial study to 
renew the west side irrigation project. I believe, if I remember 
correctly, that study cost $200,000. The initial report, or the 
report of that initial study is back and it’s positive. 
 
At the meeting, the producers and community leaders . . . And 
there were the mayors of Rosetown and Outlook at this 
meeting, as well as the RMs being represented, as well as 
leaders in the irrigation industry. There were provincial officials 
there; no elected members, but provincial officials there. There 
were some federal officials there; again, no federal elected 
members. 
 
The unanimous decision of that meeting of almost 300 people 
was to continue to take the next step, which is a major 
engineering study of the project, likely to cost in the 
neighbourhood of, I believe, $2 million. The traditional cost 
sharing arrangements for these projects are that the local 
communities raise 10 per cent. And then there is a formula 
between the federal government and the provincial government 
to share the remaining cost of such a study. 
 
I don’t know, Mr. Minister, if the federal government is 
prepared to live up to their end of the bargain. I’ll certainly be 
asking federal MPs [Member of Parliament] if they would be 
willing to do that. 
 
But I just want to know whether the province is willing to do 
their share in traditional cost sharing arrangements to carry out 
this major engineering study for the west side irrigation project. 
 
[11:15] 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you. I appreciate the member’s 
question in this very important area where we see tremendous 
potential for growth and certainly for production of 
higher-value crops. 
 
Now we’ve been doing a lot of work with the irrigation 
committees, as you’re aware of, and we’ve also been in 
discussion with the federal government. We are well aware that 
investment in this area will be important, and we’re certainly 
prepared to carry a portion of that investment. 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1645 

What we are not clear on to this point, as the member I see is 
also, hasn’t heard from his federal colleagues, that what we’re 
not aware of is how much the federal government is willing to 
commit to this. But I think in the discussions that we’ve been 
having, a recognition that this is one of those areas where there 
is good growth potential. 
 
And we’ll be working out . . . We’ve got five different studies 
going on. We’ll be looking at priority areas of the five studies, 
and we will be discussing with the federal government levels of 
support that would be appropriate, federal-provincial levels of 
support, and how that will break out. But we do see it as key in 
terms of helping agriculture in Saskatchewan become more 
profitable. 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Can I just 
presume upon you to be a little more concise. Are you saying in 
that answer that if the local area raises the traditional amount of 
funding required for this major engineering study, if the federal 
government agrees to fund the traditional amount that federal 
governments under previous arrangements have funded, are you 
saying that the province is supportive of the study continuing 
and that the province would therefore also be a partner in this 
project and fund their fair share as has been determined by 
precedents in similar projects in the past? I just want to know 
whether you’re on board or you’re not or you’re not sure. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Well to date, as I indicated, there are 
five studies that are going on. And funding for those studies has 
been jointly provided through the Canada-Saskatchewan water 
supply expansion program and we continue to support the work 
that’s going on in those. I think the member will be aware that 
we put $5.2 million in the agriculture budget to pick this up. It’s 
a new part of our Agriculture and Food area. But we’re deeply 
engaged at this point. And we will be, in terms of financing, 
further financing of projects, we will be negotiating. 
 
We’re not acknowledging or accepting any past parameters 
about how that financing will work out. But I need to note that 
the five districts — Lucky Lake Irrigation District is one — 
there’s about 9,124 acres of existing irrigation. And the studies 
identified an additional 11,000 acres of potential infill and 
expansion and the Riverhurst irrigation district which is looking 
at another approximately 11,000 acres for its infill and 
expansion, South Sask River irrigation district which is looking 
at about 10,000 acres, and the west side project which you 
indicated identified 370,000-plus acres of new irrigation 
development plus industrial, wildlife, municipal, and 
recreational opportunities. 
 
The fifth project that we’ve been supporting and providing 
funds for in the study is the Qu’Appelle south project regional 
water supply study from Qu’Appelle dam to Moose Jaw area. 
And the preliminary estimates there indicate about 200,000-plus 
acres of irrigable soils are contained in the study area. 
 
So we’re well under way in terms of our joint work with the 
irrigation districts and with the federal government. And, as I 
say, we’ve been there in terms of provision of funding in the 
studies. We’ve got a budget allocation that will enable us to 
keep in at this point and we will be negotiating what levels of 
joint funding we’ll have in moving forward. 
 

Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Minister, I 
appreciate that answer and I was aware that there were other 
groups. But could you specifically respond as to your position 
on the west side irrigation project which is considerably the 
largest project and which is the one that is really on the front 
burner? 
 
Either the major engineering study is going to be done or it’s 
not. Could you just assure me so I can assure my constituents 
that in fact if the traditional funding arrangements can be put in 
place — that is the cost share between the federal government 
and the province, along traditional lines under the program you 
mentioned as well as funding from the local area — whether in 
fact your department would use those funds allocated in this 
year’s budget to proceed with that study. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you. And I appreciate the 
member would like to be able to provide that information to 
constituents, and I’d actually like to be able to give you those 
numbers as well. But we’re very cognizant of the importance of 
each of the five. Size isn’t the only factor here because each of 
them are important to their area. So we want to get . . . All of 
those reports are not in yet either, by the way, and we want to 
get all the reports in so we can work on the priorities, make sure 
that we have the highest priority areas identified. 
 
And I will say again that in terms of levels of funding we know 
that there have been certain levels of funding that have been 
carried by different levels of government and the districts in the 
past, and on a go-forward basis we will be negotiating. We 
know that any of these developments are very costly and 
resources are precious and scarce, not only at this level but in 
discussions with the federal minister we know that there are 
going to be challenges there as well for him to meet all the 
demands that will be in front of him. 
 
So I can only say that we’ll be negotiating on moving forward 
but we do see the importance. We’ll be working with all 
districts to set the priorities and we’ll be providing a level of 
funding there. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the hon. member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair to the 
minister, Crown lease fees on Crown land, lease fees on Crown 
land took a dramatic jump this year. Could you maybe just 
explain how much they’ve gone up? And I understand that it’s 
by formula but maybe you could just elaborate on that. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Well first of all I appreciate the 
member noting that there is a relatively complex formula. One 
of the factors in that formula is of course the price of beef, and 
so we saw significant drops when the price of beef was down. 
 
And the total increase this year would be about 37.3 per cent, 
and again it’s based on a formula. When the prices are down, 
the cost for the rental will go down. When the prices of beef are 
up, the cost will go up. So 37.3 per cent increase. 
 
And I think it’s also important to note that along with the 
increase that we also provide some things as a Crown lessor to 
the lessees that they would not get in their private rentals. First 



1646 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2006 

of all, we’ve done a survey around the province, and 
significantly generally our rates are below what private rentals 
are. 
 
Also where there are leases for oil and gas, we do provide — 
though minimal — we do provide some of the oil and gas lease 
funding to the lessee as well . . . or the lessor, pardon me. And 
again, in private operations that doesn’t happen. The lessor 
generally retains all of the funding for the lease. 
 
So generally, increase of 37.3 based on the price of beef. 
Secondly, we do provide generally the lowest rentals in the 
province. Thirdly, we also provide some benefits as a lessor. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Then to follow 
up because we’ve had some concern, lessees out there that are 
questioning why, you know, there was such a dramatic increase 
this year. And one of the questions . . . They’ve said they 
thought that the formula worked on a five-year average. Is that 
part of the formula? Can you tell me? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — No, those who thought that it was a 
five-year average are not accurate. They don’t have accurate 
information. It is an annual adjustment, and it is based on the 
last year’s calf prices. Calf prices have gone up with BSE 
[bovine spongiform encephalopathy] basically not being so 
much an issue for beef and therefore the prices go up on an 
annual base based on that price. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Well thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. Chair, I 
guess the concern that a number of farmers out there have is 
that, as you’ve said and stated correctly is calf prices have 
rebounded and recovered back from when BSE first hit Canada 
and our prices for cattle of all kinds dropped. 
 
Calf prices have recovered but our cow prices and our bull 
prices . . . which I would think would somehow come into the 
formula for leased land because you know, they’re a big part of 
what farmers and ranchers out there are renting land for. The 
purpose of pasturing is for cows and bulls. And they certainly 
haven’t recovered. In fact they’re at just a terrible low yet, and 
it doesn’t look like they’re going to in the near future recover 
until the border opens up for animals of all age. So is that taken 
into consideration, or is it strictly on calf prices? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — I would say from my assessment of 
how the formula is put together that it is very fair, that the cull 
cow prices are also included as one of the factors in setting the 
final price. So overall our formula does try and take in the 
whole gamut of animals that will be on pasture. 
 
And we also, I think as I’ve indicated, relative to private rentals, 
we’re below what those rates are. So overall I think we do 
provide a very fair package, given the complex formula that 
factors in all of those elements. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Well thank you, Mr. Minister. Then a 
following question I guess. And the question would be that as 
soon as the BSE hit, the following year I would presume that 
leases then dropped quite dramatically because this is quite a 
dramatic increase. Can you tell me what the drop in the lease 
fees were shortly — I guess the following year — after the BSE 
hit and our prices dropped. 

[11:30] 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — From 2003, the changes . . . and I have 
the rent per annum is from — I don’t have the averages — but 
the rent went from five fourteen down to three eighty-one, and 
’06 back up to five twenty-three. And that’s per animal unit. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. So I guess that’s 
really why the concern seems to be with a number of producers 
out there that rent Crown land . . . is that we went from a high to 
a low to back up to a high within a three-year period, but only 
one year actually that rent had dropped dramatically, and now 
we’re right back up again so . . . 
 
Mr. Minister, I want to go on with a different issue this 
morning. And I’ve had this concern brought to me a number of 
times with the annual crop weather-based insurance. The one 
problem we’ve had . . . and I believe you’re aware of this one. 
My colleague from Cut Knife-Turtleford I believe had wrote 
you a letter about the Glaslyn weather station and the problem 
they had there where the recorded temperature for a certain 
night was 1.9 degrees. Every farmer in the area knew that it 
froze. It was common knowledge out there that frost had hit, 
and yet the recorded temperature that night — which would 
affect the insurance that they thought they had — was still 1.9 
degrees. 
 
Mr. Minister, I believe you had responded to this letter, but 
since that time have we done anything to address this issue and 
the problem with the differential temperatures that are coming 
out of areas such as the Glaslyn area? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you. I’d like to just conclude 
noting I started at ’03, the year BSE was in. I’d like to just note 
that it’s actually gone from 2001 where the price per animal 
unit was six twenty-eight. So you can see that it was quite a 
dramatic drop down to the three eighty-one. And we’re starting 
to move back up again based on the prices formula. So I think 
overall I would have to say that I believe this is a very fair 
program that does provide deep support for our producers. 
 
With regard to the weather-based crop insurance, we’re very, 
very careful when people are signing on. This is in some senses 
an easily understood program. But we’re very careful to remind 
people that there are only a certain number of weather stations; 
that the payouts will be based on the information at those 
weather stations. 
 
And we have increased those over three years. There are no 
increases this year. But we now have 129 different weather 
stations across the province. And we think that with the 
information that’s provided for those who are signing on, there 
really shouldn’t be any question about where, within the area if 
there’s a variation because everybody that signs on to a 
weather-based program should know that it is the temperature at 
the station. With all the factors that change, have temperature 
variables across the province, that it’s the temperature at the 
station that is the one that applies for the program. And I think 
that’s spelled out very, very clearly in the information that 
anybody joining the program would get. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I guess to me it 
just seemed odd. And I’ve had this brought to my attention on a 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1647 

number of other cases. And I think we all realize . . . I know, I 
believe it’s in my colleague from Moosomin’s area, in 
Broadview, always has a lower temperature. It doesn’t matter 
when frost hits; it seems Broadview is one of the areas that 
always is one, two, sometimes three degrees colder than 
everywhere else. So having said that, if some of these weather 
stations are in areas that possibly don’t go as low, I think we’re 
going to get kind of a skewed temperature recording that may 
dramatically affect a number of these people. 
 
And I think some of the concerns I’ve had were followed up on 
the August 20 frost that we had a couple of years ago where 
pretty well every farmer in the province was . . . their crops 
were damaged by it. And should you have been caught in one of 
these situations and be in this program where the recorded 
temperature was not near what you had had actually on your 
farm, it could certainly affect your bottom line when it come to 
qualifying for a payout. So that was my concern, Mr. Minister. 
 
Due to the fact that we only have so many minutes this morning 
to talk, Mr. Minister, I just want to get into the $1.5 billion, Mr. 
Minister, that the federal government has come out with. And 
maybe if you could give me kind of a breakdown in your 
understanding how . . . You know, we know there’s $1 billion 
dollars more in one part and half a billion in the other. If you 
could kind of give me a breakdown and information. Have you 
received information of how this money is going to be put out 
there and how much is coming for Saskatchewan and things 
like that, Mr. Minister? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — If I might, I would again like to 
respond to the concluding statements around crop insurance 
because the assessment is done every year as to how the 
program is applying. And as indicated, there were three years of 
increases in the number of stations. And we’re trying to get a 
handle on how many do we need overall, what’s the right 
number, is the location the right location, do we need to adjust 
location? Challenging questions, but certainly they are being 
reviewed regularly. 
 
And I would just also note for the member that Crop Insurance 
would advise most producers, rather than just signing on to 
something like the weather-based program, that an all-peril is 
really a better business risk. But each producer has to manage 
their business risk as they choose, and so we provide a variety 
of different programs. And weather-based is just one of those. 
 
And on to the question of federal funding and allocation of the 
$1.5 billion, any discussions that we’ve had with the federal 
government at this point have been quite general. And we’ve 
got a sense of where some of the funding is going to go. 
 
When we talk with our provincial counterparts, we hear some 
significant numbers for how for example the CAIS [Canadian 
agricultural income stabilization] inventory valuation 
adjustments, the two-price inventory change adjustments are 
going to work out for Saskatchewan. By our estimate, it could 
be somewhere between 3 and 400 million. And this is with — 
I’ll be very clear — this is with vague information that’s been 
provided by the federal government to date. 
 
And I talked with the Alberta minister yesterday, and they’re 
estimating somewhere in the neighbourhood of over $400 

million there because, on a two-price inventory valuation, going 
back to 2003, with their larger cattle herd, it will have a 
significant impact. 
 
So you can already see, with Saskatchewan and Alberta, we’re 
looking at almost 800 million of the 1.5 billion taken up just to 
do the retroactive pay on inventory valuation. 
 
But that said, the breakdown that we get are that — and again 
this has been very, very general — that there will be funding for 
some type of cover crop program to help deal with areas where 
there has been flooding. There will be separate disaster 
program. And we’re hearing this morning some more 
information about how that may roll out, but we do not have 
solid detail provided. 
 
Our department is speaking with the federal department to try 
and make sure what’s clear there. We have no indication at all 
of the level of funding around biofuels. So biofuels are 
identified as one of the other areas. Science research 
development, that area has also been targeted as one that will 
receive a portion of the 1.5 billion new spending. And the 
whole area of market development — which for a province like 
ours that does so much export — is very, very essential; there’ll 
be some funding for market development as well. So those 
would be the key areas that have been outlined for us. 
 
But as I say, there is a real scarcity of detail. And we’re 
working every day with the federal department to try and get 
more detail and be able to lay that out. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. And I guess we’ll 
all be waiting, especially our farmers and ranchers out there, to 
see just how this money is going to trickle down. And hopefully 
our Saskatchewan producers get their fair share of it. As we 
both know, I don’t think it’s news to either one of us, the 
tremendous amount of hurt out there. 
 
And with some of the clawbacks that have been called where 
they want the cheque back . . . I think the federal government 
putting that on hold, it doesn’t help the farmer really. But it 
certainly would help his mind be a little bit at ease that he 
doesn’t have to try and find a way to pay that back. The stress 
that that adds to farmers out there right now, as we’re fully 
aware of, is dramatic. 
 
So, Mr. Minister, I don’t mean to jump all over the place, but 
we have had questions and — due to the time limits — we 
have. Can the minister explain how crop insurance claims for 
wildlife damage are assessed and the levels of coverage that are 
available for wildlife damage? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Member will know that it is a 
federal-provincial program. The compensation is paid at 80 per 
cent of the calculated loss with $100-minimum claim, and 
compensation is paid on the grade of the crop at the time of the 
harvest. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Mr. Minister, as I said, I don’t want to 
jump all over the place, but I have to. In your remarks a few 
minutes ago, we were talking about how this money was going 
to trickle down and if . . . you know, what you knew. Did we 
hear you say, Mr. Minister, that the disaster money . . . Just the 



1648 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2006 

Porcupine people is the ones I’m worried about, or not worried 
specifically just for them but everybody, but their concern 
seems to be front and centre. Was there any explanation that 
you had how that part of the province was going to be dealt 
with? Were they going to be dealt with individually out there, 
separate from the other money that’s coming down the pipe? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — We have had many discussions with 
the federal government on this front and both at the ministerial 
level and with representatives from Porcupine. And though we 
understand today that there will be a separate program to 
address that particular situation, there have been discussions 
about . . . will we have then an ongoing separate disaster 
program? It’ll be separate from Crop Insurance; will it use the 
data from Crop Insurance to help provide parameters for 
payout? 
 
All of that has been under discussion, but we are waiting for the 
federal government to get back to us. We have certainly pressed 
to try and get information. It is my hope that we will have, by as 
early as next week, that we will have a definitive program laid 
out. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Well thank you, Minister. Minister, and if 
we would ask one thing is if you would let us know when you 
find out because the member from Kelvington-Wadena is very 
interested in her constituents so . . . And at this time, Mr. 
Minister, I’ll pass over to my colleague. 
 
[11:45] 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the hon. member for Biggar. 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Minister, my 
questions concern The Farm Land Security Act and the Farm 
Land Security Board. Is it true that the moratorium concerning 
Ducks Unlimited has been lifted, and they’re allowed to 
purchase land again in the province? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Yes, the moratorium has been lifted 
out. Ducks Unlimited is now able to purchase, but there are 
parameters set out by regulation which limit the extent of 
purchase over a given time and over a particular region as well. 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you. Mr. Chair, to the minister: would 
you have with you today the statistics about how many 
exemptions have been granted to foreigners to purchase 
marginal farm land in the province? And if you have it, for the 
last three years? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — No, I appreciate the question though. 
It does affect our rural landscape. It is for the Minister of Justice 
and the Farm Land Security Board does come under the 
Department of Justice. 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you. I’ll just pursue it a little bit more if 
you can shed some light on it. My concern is that constituents 
that I have . . . is that he has a game farm — whether that’s 
relevant or not, I believe it’s elk that he has — on marginal 
land. He has a potential buyer, a purchaser which is from the 
United States, a US citizen. And they . . . Well the bureaucracy 
behind the application to get an exemption is part of his 
concern, but through hearsay he has heard that there have been 

exemptions granted for similar types of situations. And it’s kind 
of who knows who and some people get in and some people 
don’t. 
 
And that’s the concern that I’m raising. Are there exemptions 
being granted to any foreigner, whether from the United States 
or elsewhere in the world, to buy farm land in Saskatchewan 
whether it’s marginal land or for game farming or any other 
purpose? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you. I think again I’ll make 
note that the Farm Land Security Board and its work is under 
the Department of Justice. But what I can tell the member is 
that it is clearly understood that the Farm Land Security Board 
would receive applications for exemptions and they deal with 
them on a case-by-case basis. There are guidelines by which 
they make their decisions, and those really are the processes by 
which anyone wanting an exemption would have to face. 
 
Clearly I would say that it is not, in any way that I have heard, 
seen any evidence, that it would be based on a who knows who. 
It is a quasi-judicial board that really does take a look at the 
facts and makes its decision based on those. 
 
The Chair: — I recognize the member from Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Chair. To the minister and to 
his officials, with the BSE program the province came out with 
a ruminant program. And a question was raised from a couple 
who happened to have a flock of sheep and they were 
concerned with the way the count was taken in their case. And 
I’m wondering. A number of issues arose. They felt that the 
count hadn’t been adequately counted, and as a result they were 
short some of the funds they felt were rightfully theirs. 
 
Mr. Minister, what would be the proper procedure to make 
application to address this issue and who would be the best 
person to contact in regards to the program? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — If there is an ongoing issue . . . Just to 
note that during the active period there was a producer panel 
that looked at appeals that were brought forward. Anybody 
could bring forward an appeal on the process, if they had 
administrative concerns, and it would be decided by a producer 
panel. 
 
Because basically the program is finished, the panel is not today 
constituted. But if you have a constituent who still has a 
concern, if they want to appeal, if they would bring that, send it 
to the department, we can reconstitute the appeal board to look 
at the situation. Thank you. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I’ll follow up with that 
and get that information to your office and through you to the 
department. 
 
Mr. Minister, with the ongoing issues surrounding agriculture 
and the costs that are incurred and the low commodity prices, 
there have been a number of questions, and of course we know 
of the problems that CAIS has. And I understand that the 
federal government has certainly been looking at some changes 
and some changes that they feel that would at least address 
some of the concerns. 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1649 

And, Mr. Minister, I’m not sure if you were in Yorkton when 
Blair Harris made his presentation but he talked about the 
agricultural stabilization program and inventories. And I’ve 
heard that the federal government is certainly looking at this 
and looking at correcting the problems around the inventory 
program. 
 
However, Madam Chairman, to the minister, I want to go a 
little bit beyond that as well. Recently I believe, Mr. Minister, 
you received a email from a gentlemen, Scott Norton, who sat 
down with some producers and put forward a number of ideas 
in regards to agriculture and how we address the long-term 
issue regarding overproduction and the costs that are incurred as 
a result of the overproduction, the low commodity prices. And 
Mr. Norton came up with some suggestions. One was taking 
land out of production. 
 
I’m wondering, Mr. Minister, has your department looked at 
these suggestions and whether or not your department has some 
suggestions and comments to Mr. Norton and agriculture 
producers who have been trying to get their heads around how 
we address low commodity prices. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — I just say to the member that there 
have been over the years many attempts at trying to push the 
market and try to get some correction in prices by doing 
set-asides. One of the challenges where we’re dealing with such 
a vast world market is that Canada could probably today 
withdraw much of our production and it would not have a 
significant world impact in terms of price. Now we’ve had 
some breakdown on numbers. It would have minimal impact for 
a short period but when land is brought into production, it 
would not hold. 
 
Secondly, the bigger problem is that by taking our land out of 
production and not putting the goods on the market, is we 
basically lose market share. And there are certainly competitors 
out there who are looking to take over some of the traditional 
markets that Canada has held. And we have seen in some of the 
bilateral agreements that have been made already that there has 
been some of what has been traditionally seen as our market, 
for example Moroccan durum that the United States, through 
bilateral agreement, has basically scooped that market. 
 
So we don’t, in our analysis to date, we don’t see any 
productive results of taking land out of production on a 
temporary base to try and manipulate market price. It looks like 
it would be more costly overall to producers and to Canada’s 
place in the world market. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Minister, of the Canadian production, what 
amount of our production would we actually consume 
domestically? 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — On a provincial base we export about 
75 per cent of what we produce. We produce annually 
somewhere in the neighbourhood of 26 to 27 million metric 
tons of grains and oilseeds. We export out of Saskatchewan 
about 75 per cent of that. On a national base about 45 per cent 
would be consumed in Canada and the bulk then would be 
exported beyond our national borders. And that’s of the total 
Canadian production. 
 

Mr. Toth: — Madam Chair, thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. 
Minister, I appreciate that because I kind of sense that’s where 
we might be. And I guess the question has been raised, is there 
a potential at least at the domestic level to . . . and I’m not sure 
if it’s the wheat growers or APAS [Agricultural Producers 
Association of Saskatchewan] had — when they were selling 
the bread — I think they talked about adding 5 cents a loaf and 
putting that into a fund that would go directly to producers. 
 
And I guess the question arises many times, if we were to have 
an additional cost on food commodities that would go directly 
into a pot that would be distributed to producers, whether or not 
that might be an option of addressing this issue rather than 
always going to government and coming out with interim crisis 
payments to address producer needs. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Such a program would have to be 
done nationally, and we’ve seen no . . . any indication at all 
from the federal government that there is an interest in engaging 
in that type of program, where you’d have a dedicated tax on 
food that would be returned to producers. 
 
Provincially I think it’s important to note that our focus has 
been on value-added, and over the last 10 years we’ve seen a 
doubling of the amount of primary product that is processed in 
Saskatchewan. And certainly the work that has been going on 
over this last year in particular, we’re seeing some greater 
significant potential for even more rapid growth in processing 
of primary product here in the province. And probably over the 
next few months we’ll be hearing a number of announcements 
about new developments in that area which are going to be 
helpful in terms of where our product is going, how it’s being 
used. And eventually those announcements and those changes, 
in terms of more processing here in the province, will have an 
impact on the price of the product. 
 
We’ve seen significant changes. Today I think we’re at in the 
US about probably 15 per cent — a little above 15 per cent — 
of the corn is now going into ethanol production. Within a very 
short order that’s going to be at about 25 per cent of the corn 
crop. And 60 per cent of rapeseed oil — high-quality rapeseed 
food oil — in Europe is going into biodiesel production there. 
 
And so as some of these very high-quality goods are taken out 
of the food market for energy production, looking at basic 
economic laws that seem to have some validity over the 
decades, with the increase in demand we should see a 
corresponding increase in price for the product. 
 
But our major focus today, rather than trying to create another 
way of taxing and then applying that funding back, our major 
focus is trying to increase the value-add and we are working 
with the federal government on that front as well. And we’re 
looking forward to, with mandates being established for 
biofuels federally, we’re looking forward to working with them, 
taking what we have already done here on the ethanol side, and 
expanding operations so that we will see more domestic 
processing of our goods here. I think that will only be good 
news for producers in the province. 
 
[12:00] 
 
Mr. Toth: — Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. 



1650 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2006 

Minister, I note the time but one final comment. I think just this 
past, in fact, just a couple days ago the inventories of crops still 
on the farm came out. And those inventories certainly don’t 
speak well or don’t bode well for producers when we see some 
of the commodities already in the bin are more than what we 
would naturally produce a year or actually market. So it’s 
certainly going to create a problem. 
 
And I don’t disagree with you in the fact that down the road as 
we move further into ethanol and biodiesel, we’ll remove some 
of those commodities out of the food chain which may impact 
. . . Especially if the Americans get into more ethanol. And I’m 
told when they get into full-scale production that maybe most of 
their corn may actually move into ethanol production because 
it’s a commodity that really works well in ethanol. 
 
So I guess the question, Mr. Minister, in your discussions with 
the federal minister, and the debate that’s certainly ongoing as 
producers get into the field and try to anticipate where they 
might be this fall, is what may be in the pipe or coming down 
the pipe to address some of the financial problems that are 
facing producers today. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Well with reports on world conditions, 
recognizing that always the markets shift depending on if there 
are problems in a particular area — and we are hearing of some 
areas where there are problems — it is our estimation that if 
those things prove out, that there will be more demand and that 
that demand should help clear some of the inventory, hopefully 
a significant portion of the inventory that is held right now. 
 
On top of that we are still of course waiting to know what’s 
going to happen in terms of market development which the 
federal government has said they are going to be putting extra 
emphasis on. We want to see those markets open up to help 
with our development. Thank you.

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Madam Chair, I’d like to introduce two 
guests who’ve just arrived in the Speaker’s gallery, two friends 
from Saskatchewan Rivers. I’d like to introduce Donna 
Kingfisher, who I first met when I was working at the SUNTEP 
[Saskatchewan urban native teacher education program] 
program and Donna was working for the Prince Albert Grand 
Council as the post-secondary education coordinator. She is 
now a councillor for Sturgeon Lake First Nation and very 
actively involved in doing good work for her community there. 
 
And with Donna is her daughter Rane. Rane is now just on the 

verge of graduating from Wild Rose School, which is a rural 
school in Sask Rivers constituency. She’s getting ready for her 
graduation and will be moving on to Carlton Comprehensive 
High School in Prince Albert. And this is Rane’s first visit to 
the legislature and I think and hope that she might be interested 
enough to some day take a seat in this place. So I ask members 
to welcome them here to the Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

the minister and all of the officials for being here on this Friday 
afternoon. We don’t a lot of time left; we only have, I guess, 55 
minutes or 50 minutes, so I’m not going to spend probably a lot 
of time in any one area. I’ll probably be bouncing around quite 
a bit, and I have other colleagues that want to ask some 
questions — so quick to the questions. 
 
I was talking to a physician graduate from Saskatoon the last 
couple of days; his name is Mike Chater. He’s from Nova 
Scotia originally. He’s taken his last four years of medical 
training here in Saskatchewan. He’s talked to the department, I 
believe. He’s talked to the deputy minister. He sent a letter to 
the minister on May 4, so a couple of weeks ago, regarding the 
fact that he wants to do some residency here in the province, 
and that is not working out. 
 
He’s looking to get into the specialty that he is . . . And he’s not 
set on one specific specialty. I think he has some options. But 
he’s looking at going out of the province because of not being 
able to find a spot here in Saskatchewan. I think it’s a shame 
that we’ve spent four years, you know, with education on this 
person and then that he travels out of the province. He’s not 
interested in family medicine but other specialties. 
 
And so I just ask if the minister could comment on this. I know 
he’s talked to the Dean of Medicine in Saskatoon. And there 
just seems to be a bit of a issue there that he’s kind of falling 
through the cracks. And it would be a shame to lose someone 
like this. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for the question. In 
the preamble the member opposite talked about the short period 
of time we have and the, you know, quick get to the questions. 
And some questions don’t have a quick answer to them. I will 
not purposely delay in the answer, but I do want to ensure that 
we put on the record that which needs to be on the record. 
 
In this case indeed, we have an individual that’s participated in 
a process for matching for residency positions in the province. 
The CARMS [Canadian resident matching service] program is a 
program that was designed to provide fair and equitable access 
to individuals taking up specialties. This process has been in 
place for some time. The process works by choosing a specialty 
and finding a match, and like so many of our other labour-force 
development programs and education programs, they’re tied to 
the, for lack of a better word, labour-force development needs 
as we go out. 
 
This individual chose in the first round of CARMS, specialties 
that, for lack of a better word, one would say are oversubscribed 
or there were no matches found. As a result he has suggested 
that we change the CARMS process to assist him to go into a 
residency position that meets some of his needs. This is 
something that complicates the fair and equitable access to 
residency positions for all of those others in the province who 
might find themselves in a similar situation. 
 
There are other alternatives, and he has chosen to discuss with 
the College of Medicine. He’s discussed issues with the deputy 

minister of Health. We are all working with him to try and find 
the best circumstances that would allow him to remain in the 
province. 
 
Individuals at the end of the day still make their own decisions 
as to where they will end up in the system and in their careers. 
There’s individual choice obviously that we support, but we’d 
like him to consider remaining in the province just as much as 
the member opposite would. 
 
There are choices. CARMS has second rounds. He can apply 
under the second round for a match, or indeed he can be 
choosing something else. The member opposite said he’s 
interested in not any one specific specialty. There are other 
options available to him. We will continue to talk to him. We’ll 
continue to work with him, but I do not believe that changing 
the CARMS program to assist him personally is the only 
answer in this case. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Just one supplement question on this issue. 
Just after talking to him he seemed to . . . He gave me the 
impression or he was saying that graduates, or as you’re going 
through graduate studies, they need to start streaming quite 
early — two to three years before they get to graduation. And I 
know he was in one, in neurosurgery I believe it was, and then 
after a couple of years realized that probably isn’t the area that 
he should be in and decided to pursue another specialty. And 
the problem is, is that you kind of fall behind everybody else 
that just continues on one stream. Would that be fair? Is that 
maybe an issue, or a problem with the CARM’s process, that if 
you don’t follow along with your initial stream, that you tend to 
get left behind? 
 
[12:15] 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — I think I can be fairly brief with this 
answer. For all intents and purposes, there’s a mixed bag here. I 
can say that no, the process that the member opposite outlined 
should not necessarily affect the outcome. All people in this 
position have a core program, and out of that core program they 
then go into a rotation in which they will indeed look at 
different specialties, get exposed to different specialties. And 
it’s out of that that they then make their choices going forward. 
 
He may have been exposed to and have an interest in 
neurosurgery to begin with through the rotation, but his ultimate 
choice as I understand it was first plastic surgery and secondly 
general surgery, both very competitive — a large number of 
individuals seeking matches. As a result if we were to change 
the program to allow him to have a position in plastic surgery or 
general surgery, then of course we are providing an unfair 
access to people who otherwise knew that in the competitive 
circumstances, they chose not to go there but chose a different 
specialty. This would be unfair to others to do that. So we just 
have to go through the normal processes, keep talking to them, 
keep working through the circumstances without changes to the 
core program. And hopefully he will be in a position to make a 
decision to work within the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I would just . . . I 
guess I’m going to move on to another subject. But before I do I 
would just recommend to the department to do as much as you 
can to keep our physicians, trained physicians, in the province 



1652 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2006 

because, I mean, we’ve certainly invested. 
 
And he’s willing, more than willing to sign a contract and stay 
in this province. He loves the province. He doesn’t want to have 
to leave the province. But I guess if the suitable matches aren’t 
available, he’s left with no other option. So I’d call on the 
department to keep in touch with him and do what you can to 
. . . And I realize, you know, sometimes it’s hard to make 
exceptions. But we certainly would like to keep our physicians, 
trained physicians, in our province. 
 
I wanted to talk a little bit about the SAIL [Saskatchewan Aids 
to Independent Living] program, Aids to Independent Living. I 
know whenever we have Health estimates and I have all the 
officials here with all their binders, I want to make sure I can 
try and at least ask a couple questions in each area because it 
can be a long day just sitting back there I’m sure. But regarding 
the Aids to Independent Living, and I had a chance to talk with 
the voices for people living with disabilities. And they had a 
few concerns regarding that. 
 
Now my first question will be on the individualized funding 
program that was put in place a couple years ago. The fact that 
there’s only 50 people, I believe, on individualized funding 
right now, that’s about the same as when the program, you 
know, shortly after it was implemented. And the question is, 
why is that not growing? Why are we not expanding that 
program? Because it seems like, you know, as it was explained 
to me, a very worthwhile program. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for that question. 
There may be some confusion amongst some of the people that 
the member opposite is talking about, has been talking to. 
Actually there’s 64 individuals currently on that program. 
That’s a 28 per cent increase over last year, so the program is 
growing. 
 
It’s a program that essentially is personal choice. People can be 
on it or they receive their care stuff through the regional health 
authorities. Some people find it more convenient or acceptable 
under the RHAs [regional health authority] and other people 
under this program for greater independence. We originally 
anticipated this program may be subscribed to 100 people. So 
there is room for growth should the personal choice option be 
exercised by individuals. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Just a follow-up then. How are people 
informed that they have that option available to them? Is there 
some sort of a process that people that are needing assistance 
are informed to know whether that’s available? 
 
And my second question — and I just have to step out for a 
second — but my second question is regarding SAIL and the 
issuing of living assistance aids, be it wheelchairs or bars in 
bathrooms or whatever that is. When that material is given out, 
is it tracked, and how much comes back when they’re done 
using it or whatever the situation might happen? Because it 
seems like, I mean this material is not . . . these living assistance 
aids are maybe not inexpensive. There’s a lot going out. How 
much is coming back so that they can be reused, i.e., a 
wheelchair? You know a person is in a wheelchair for a couple 
of years and then for whatever reason may not need it. Does 
that wheelchair come back to SAIL? So those are my two 

questions. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — I assume I have to speak loudly so the 
member can hear the answer to this question having, as he said, 
stepped out. For the record, the member’s first question had to 
do with awareness. How do people know about the program? 
And essentially the program that the member opposite is 
referring to is a part of the home care assessment process. And 
when people come in for their assessment interview, it’s a 
relatively straightforward matter of information being provided, 
discussions taking place, assessments being made, discussed, 
and moved along. So really it’s a straightforward process. It 
involves people who really are in a position to take advantage 
of the program. 
 
Secondly, under the individual aids provided for independent 
living, under the program, the question was, how much of the 
equipment comes back? And he suggested wheelchairs for 
example. Most of the equipment under the program is provided 
through the Abilities Council. The Abilities Council maintains 
an inventory system. Certainly they track the equipment that is 
provided. A lot of the, for lack of a better word, equipment 
that’s provided under the program are actually disposables, and 
there’s no expectation that they come back. But in terms of 
things like crutches and wheelchairs — specific to the 
member’s question — indeed there’s an inventory kept. The 
Abilities Council knows where the equipment is and what the 
expected return is. 
 
Certainly — and I don’t have any numbers on this — certainly 
there is equipment that does not find its way back. The Abilities 
Council has made provisions for some equipment that doesn’t 
come back. And in some cases I believe there are even some 
deposits required — for crutches, for example — to provide 
some incentive to return the equipment. I can’t say how much 
does not come back, which was the specific question, but the 
Abilities Council is managing this program, I would argue, 
extremely well. 
 
The Chair: — The member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Minister, I’ve got 
a number of areas as well I want to delve into a bit, first of all, a 
question regarding positions in the province and those who have 
come from out of province, out of country. And the question 
has come, regards to bringing family members into the country. 
And I’m wondering, Mr. Minister, whether there’s a policy 
within the department to assist these doctors in understanding 
the process and helping them through the process, and indeed 
moving the process forward in regards to bringing family 
members to the country. 
 
[12:30] 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — In answering the member’s question, I 
have a bit of a question which he may respond to in any case. 
Defining family, I’ve got . . . I can provide some answer in 
general. Are we talking family outside of spouses and children? 
Are we just talking spouses and children? Because I’m not 
aware of significant challenges regarding spouses and children. 
Visas being granted by the federal government for example, in 
most cases, include families and children. 
 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1653 

That having been said, there are a number of things that are 
occurring within the province. Number one, the province has 
invested recently in our expansion of our immigrant nominee 
program. Our immigrant nominee program is something that 
assists in a speedy . . . working more quickly through the 
federal process of immigration. Obviously anyone coming into 
Canada is subject to federal rules and regulations on 
immigration. And Saskatchewan’s nominee program assists in 
expediting that process. But more importantly, at the end of last 
year the province of Saskatchewan and the federal government 
entered into an agreement to assist internationally educated 
health professionals to transition into the province once we 
knew that they were coming. 
 
So what’s involved in that transition? There is a program, 
jointly funded by the federal and provincial government to 
assist in that transition. Maybe if the member has some specific 
questions, we might be able to address this more specifically. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
The two cases that actually were brought to my attention was 
one of a situation where the doctor was trying to get a spouse 
and children in. I believe they are currently here, but they ran 
into a number of snags. The second one is in regards to parents 
and bringing parents in to be close to families. So you can get 
back to me if you have further comments in that regard. 
 
I’d like to move on to another area. I received a letter recently 
from a gentleman who has been dealing with the issue of cancer 
and underwent the stem cell transplant program, and comments 
very highly and indicates that his doctor told him that this was 
the only reasonable avenue to continue life and an acceptable 
lifestyle. In other words, “the transplant saved and extended my 
life.” 
 
So he has written in support of a recent article that was printed 
in the Leader-Post on March 10 regarding an external review 
funded by the province that recommended that we need to 
upgrade our stem cell research program in the province of 
Saskatchewan. And I understand from the article that last year 
18 patients were referred out of province. To date we’ve already 
spent $2.8 million sending patients out of province because of 
the fact that it appears we have more need than we have the 
ability. And I wonder, Mr. Minister, what the department is 
doing to address this issue as presented by the review panel. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for the question. 
The member does cite a review that’s been done and some of 
the resources that have been assigned to the stem cell program. 
The province has been committed to and continues to be 
committed to the stem cell program and welcomes the results of 
the review. 
 
The review indicated a preference for doing more of the work in 
province as opposed to out of the province. As a result of the 
review, the cancer agency and the people in Saskatoon and 
Regina have been asked to pull together a work plan so that we 
can determine how best to do that. The department is supportive 
of their efforts in doing so. We are currently, as the member 
pointed out, doing out-of-province referrals. There are dollars 
available in that out-of-province referral program. 
 
When the work plans from the agency have been prepared, 

evaluated, and recommendations made for moving forward, the 
department would see no difficulty whatsoever utilizing dollars 
that are available in our out-of-province expenditures, move 
them in the province and do more of that work internally. So 
we’re very supportive of the recommendation out of the review. 
We’re currently working on ways to be successful in more work 
being done inside the province. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Chair, Mr. Minster, the other question that 
arises from this is not just what is the department doing in 
responding . . . And part of the response, I guess, would be the 
recruitment and retention of physicians within the program. 
And I think we’re aware in this Assembly that we currently 
have a member of the Assembly who is actually in need of the 
transplant program and maybe possibly currently going through 
it. So it’s not just whether it’s members of the Assembly. It’s 
members of the general public. It’s certainly an issue that we 
need to look at very carefully. 
 
And so I guess, Mr. Minister, you indicated that you’ve asked 
for a plan of action. And I’m wondering, Mr. Minister, if you 
can indicate when you expect that plan of action to be brought 
forward and how the department will respond and how quickly 
can we be assured that this program will continue to function 
and in fact be improved upon? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — A couple of things that I can say in 
response to the member’s question in this regard. The first one I 
think is the most important, and that is we don’t need to 
complete the work plan to begin work on the recruitment and 
retention efforts and in preparing for the results of the work 
plan to be in place. The second thing is the work plan is 
primarily interested in the ability to finance the activity that will 
take place. And we’re quite prepared to act on that very quickly 
once the work plan is developed. 
 
There currently are two stem cell hematologists in place in 
Saskatoon. The region is currently recruiting to add to that 
number. We would anticipate one position in the fairly near 
future. The second one, more a secondary position, may take a 
little longer to put in place. But that having been said, the 
recruitment efforts are currently under way to speed up the 
process. Secondly, the work plan development, we will be able 
to respond to it quite quickly once the work being done there is 
completed. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Chair, Mr. Minister, I’d like to move on to 
another area. What is the criteria in the province to set up a 
renal dialysis unit in a community? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — I don’t have the exact criteria handy. And 
perhaps if someone finds it for me while I’m sort of developing 
the answer to your question, they can hand me the specific 
criteria because it is fairly specific. 
 
I am very excited about the expansion of the renal dialysis 
program in the province. A few years ago the renal dialysis was 
delivered only in Saskatoon and Regina. We created a 
integrated renal program steering committee that was put 
together to assist with the expansion of the program to satellite 
locations. 
 
[12:45] 



1654 Saskatchewan Hansard May 12, 2006 

And in a very short period of time the program has expanded to 
include all regional hospitals in the province — the six regional 
hospitals that exist — and includes expansion to one district 
hospital which is in Tisdale. Most recently, we’ve expanded the 
delivery of service in Tisdale and we’ve expanded the overall 
program to be delivered in Estevan. So the current dollars for 
expansion in this year allow us to go to Estevan and to provide 
some additional service in Tisdale. 
 
So now we’ve got the provincial hospitals in Saskatoon and 
Regina, the regional hospitals across the province, and one 
district hospital currently in place. The advice that we get for 
the expansion of the program —and of course the expansion 
will continue . . . 
 
The steering committee evaluates the needs for this expansion 
based on a number of things — the criteria that the member 
opposite is asking — and it would include a number of things. 
Off the top of my head: the number of people in an area, the 
distance from which they are from their current renal dialysis 
site, the ability of an area to support or develop the support 
mechanisms for that site. 
 
We are currently challenged because of the shortage that we’ve 
talked about in this Chamber about nurses. We are currently 
challenged to be able to staff sites. We do know that for 
example the development of the program in Estevan has been 
delayed by a couple of months as a result of staffing 
requirements. We know that an expansion that is necessary, that 
could occur in North Battleford is also subject to staffing 
circumstances in that area. 
 
So the criteria for expansion, continued expansion of the 
program, involves a number of things, not the least of which is 
the ability of the system to be able to ensure that it operates 
sustainably for many years into the future. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Chair, Mr. Minister, as you’re no doubt 
aware by now, a group of individuals, First Nations leaders, 
community leaders, health leaders in the Broadview area have 
been doing a significant amount of work. 
 
Currently there are 22 people in that area that are travelling to 
other centres for their dialysis needs. And it just so happens if 
you look at the geography, Broadview happens to be right on 
the outside edge. It’s almost equal distance to Yorkton, Estevan, 
even to Regina for a lot of these patients which becomes a 
costly factor to them. 
 
And, Mr. Minister, as of today my understanding is they 
haven’t really been given a lot of support in the work and 
efforts they’ve been doing. Mr. Minister, can you indicate 
whether or not this is an area that would be looked at very 
seriously in view of the ongoing issues around dialysis, a need 
for dialysis, and especially in regards to the First Nations 
support in that area and the need they have in their community? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Again I appreciate the member’s question 
in this regard. And as I indicated earlier, the province is very 
excited about and committed to an expansion of the renal 
dialysis program. There is no doubt that people are better served 
being able to do that dialysis closer to home than they have 
been just with service in Saskatoon and Regina. 

The steering committee has had representation from the 
Broadview area, and actually the Broadview area people have 
expanded their sort of circle of influence considerably beyond 
the approach to the steering committee. The Broadview people 
have approached other communities for support. They’ve 
approached the regional health authority for support, and of 
course they’ve even approached my office. 
 
The last meeting I had with regards to the Broadview site, 
specific to First Nations issues, was yesterday as a matter of 
fact. I had a meeting with the Chief of Sakimay and Federation 
of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and others on this issue. 
 
The steering committee has recommended, based on the criteria, 
that the next sites for expansion in the province, based on 
similar concerns raised by the people in Broadview, would 
include Meadow Lake and La Ronge, the people who have 
significant number of individuals requiring dialysis and who 
have considerable distances to travel for that dialysis service. 
And indeed we do have other areas of the province that are 
expressing some similar concerns. 
 
The people of Broadview are very vocal. They are also doing 
some very good work in bringing the issues to the attention of 
the committee. But we have the committee to assess the needs 
across the province and to make recommendations based on the 
ability of the system to respond and on a priorization of 
requirements based on the criteria that’s in place. 
 
So at this point in time the dialysis program is continuing to 
expand. The steering committee is in place to review the 
recommendations coming forward. The expansion this year 
includes a site in Estevan — a complete site from the ground 
up. And at this point in time the next priority is the community 
of Meadow Lake. 
 
I simply say to the people in Broadview, continue to do the 
work that you’re doing. And continue to work within the health 
region and the steering committee to fit this into the priority 
process. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the hon. member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you. We’ll try and squeeze a couple 
more questions in here. I see the keeper of time has just moved 
to his chair which is always kind of scary. 
 
I do have one question on what is the average for a return for 
pathology reports being sent to a lab and back. What is the 
department’s kind of targeted time for reports to get back to the 
physician and then to the patient? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — The member asked a simple question that 
requires a little bit of thought and maybe a little longer answer. 
And I apologize for this. 
 
The issue is primarily one dealt with by the regions. That 
having been said, there is a laboratory quality assurance 
program operated by the College of Physicians and Surgeons 
with a grant from Saskatchewan Health. The purpose of the 
quality assurance program, the mandate essentially is to ensure 
that the laboratory work meets quality standards, and of course 



May 12, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1655 

that includes that the results are provided in a timely manner. 
 
Now inside the health regions of course the turnaround time on 
lab tests would depend on what type of test is being asked. In 
the operating room for example, cancer, you might be able to 
turn around in a couple of hours. For other tests it might be a 
couple of days or a couple of weeks depending on what the 
physician is looking for and what would be considered a timely 
manner. 
 
The health regions would monitor this, and if they found that 
there was something that was out of order they would act on it. 
But we’re very pleased about the quality assurance program 
that’s currently in place. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the Government House 
Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Chair, I’ll move that the committee 
rise, report progress, and ask for leave to sit again. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — The Government House Leader has 
moved that the committee rise, report progress, and ask for 
leave to sit again. Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt 
that motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — That is carried. 
 
[The Deputy Speaker resumed the Chair.] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Greystone. 
 
Mr. Prebble: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. I’m instructed by the committee to report progress and 
ask for leave to sit again. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member has asked to report 
progress, and asked for leave to sit again. When shall the 
committee sit again? I recognize the Government House 
Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Next sitting of the House, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Next sitting of the House. I recognize 
the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Madam Deputy Speaker, with a wish for 
everybody who is or attached to a mother that it’ll be a 
wonderful Mother’s Day weekend, I move this House do now 
adjourn. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I thank all members for their 
wonderful co-operation this week, and wish for Mr. Speaker a 
healthy next week. This House does now stand adjourned until 
Monday at 1:30 p.m. 
 
[The Assembly adjourned at 12:58.]
