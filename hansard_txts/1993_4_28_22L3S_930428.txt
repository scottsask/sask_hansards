ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 

 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It's my 

pleasure this afternoon on behalf of the people of 

Saskatchewan to present a petition. And I will read the prayer, 

Mr. Speaker: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to postpone consideration of The 

Health Districts Act so that communities may continue their 

efforts to organize their people and have a genuine impact on 

the process without intimidation or threat of arbitrary action 

by the government. 

 

 And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I have hundreds and hundreds of names attached 

from such towns as Hazenmore, Mankota, Ferland, Oxbow — 

indeed, Mr. Speaker, a composite of Saskatchewan indeed. 

And it gives me a great deal of pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to put 

these on the Table at this time. Thank you. 

 

Mr. Devine: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too want to table 

petitions with respect to health care today. And I will read the 

prayer. These petitioners are from . . . There are literally 

hundreds of petitioners' names here on these petitions from 

Bracken and from Val Marie, south-west part of the province, 

Orkney, Climax, more from Val Marie, more from Bracken, 

from Brock, Saskatchewan; and more from the south-west, a 

large number from Orkney. 

 

I'll read the prayer, Mr. Speaker: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to postpone consideration of The 

Health Districts Act so that communities may continue their 

efforts to organize their people and have a genuine impact on 

the process without intimidation or threat of arbitrary action 

by the government. 

 

 As in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

I do so table. 

 

Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm happy today to 

present petitions on behalf of petitioners from the people of 

Saskatchewan with regards to the health issue. I'll read the 

prayer: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to postpone consideration of The 

Health Districts 

Act so that communities may continue their efforts to 

organize their people and have the genuine impact on the 

process without intimidation or threat of arbitrary action by 

the government. 

 

 And as in duty bound, your petitioners ever pray. 

 

From Grenfell, and looks like a lot of people from Oxbow and 

Assiniboia and in that whole area down south there. We've got 

several hundreds of names this morning, Mr. Speaker. And I 

take great pleasure in presenting them now. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too have a 

number of petitions to present. I will read the prayer: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to postpone consideration of The 

Health Districts Act so that communities may continue their 

efforts to organize their people and have a genuine impact on 

the process without intimidation or threat of arbitrary action 

by the government. 

 

 And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

These petitions, Mr. Speaker, come from the Oxbow, Alameda, 

Glen Ewen, Carnduff area in the south-east; and from the 

south-west area, Frontier, Claydon, Climax, Val Marie, 

Bracken, and the south-west area. So it covers a good portion 

of the province, Mr. Speaker. I will table these now. 

 

Mr. Britton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too have several 

pages of petitions . . . names on petitions that I would like to 

table today, Mr. Speaker. And I would like to therefore read the 

prayer: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to postpone consideration of The 

Health Districts Act so that communities may continue their 

efforts to organize their people and have a genuine impact on 

the process without intimidation or threat of arbitrary action 

by the government. 

 

 As in duty bound, your petitioners humbly pray. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out these petitions are signed 

by people from Frontier, Oxbow, all the way across to Cut 

Knife, and there are signatures from the reservations up there 

— Poundmaker, Sweetgrass — Aberdeen, Sask., Paynton, Cut 

Knife. 

 

All of these people are asking the government the same thing 

— just to hold back on their . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. The member knows he 



1282 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

can't comment on the petition. 

 

Mr. Britton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would present 

these. 

 

Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I would 

like to as well present some petitions to the Assembly, and I'd 

like to read the prayer: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 

Honourable Assembly may be pleased to postpone 

consideration of The Health Districts Act so that 

communities may continue their efforts to organize their 

people and have a genuine impact on the process without 

intimidation or threat of arbitrary action by the government. 

 

 And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

These petitions are signed by individuals from Regina, Watson, 

more from Watson, right across the southern and western part 

of the province, and I present it to the Assembly. 

 

Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I as well have petitions 

with respect to health care in the province. Mr. Speaker, there 

are petitions here from Watson, Saskatchewan; let's see, page 

after page from Watson, Quill Lake, Macklin, Dodsland, St. 

Walburg, Morse, Herbert, Gull Lake, Eston, Dodsland, 

Shaunavon. Mr. Speaker, these petitions come from all over 

Saskatchewan. I present them now. 

 

Mr. Martens: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too have petitions 

and I'll read the prayer. 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to postpone consideration of The 

Health Districts Act so that communities may continue their 

efforts to organize their people and have a genuine impact on 

the process without intimidation or threat of arbitrary action 

by the government. 

 

 As in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, I have them from Bracken, Shaunavon, 

Climax, Invermay, Rama, Margo, from Cupar, from Ferland, 

Mankota, from just about all over the province of 

Saskatchewan — Orkney, Climax, Bracken, Assiniboia, 

McCord. And I want to, Mr. Speaker, table these at this time. 

 

NOTICES OF MOTIONS AND QUESTIONS 

 

Ms. Haverstock: — Mr. Speaker, I give notice that I shall on 

Friday next ask the government the following question: 

 

 Regarding per diems paid to members of the Legislative 

Assembly since November of 1991: (1) how many per diems 

claims were submitted 

by members for "other reasons" than attendance in the 

legislature; (2) what was the value of those claims; and (3) 

what was the total value of such claims submitted by 

members representing constituencies in the city of Regina? 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my 

pleasure to introduce to you and through you to the members of 

the House some very special guests who are here with us today. 

They are seated in your gallery, Mr. Speaker. And I would like 

to draw your attention to His Excellency, Tajeddine Baddou, 

Ambassador for Morocco, and his wife, Madame Marie-Ange 

Baddou. 

 

We are very pleased to have them here with us. I understand 

that this is the first visit to Saskatchewan of an Ambassador 

from Morocco, so that makes it a very significant event. I know 

that Madame Baddou is very interested, I'm told, in health 

reform and indeed pioneered the blood transfusion system that 

exists in Morocco today. 

 

His Excellency, the Ambassador, is here representing a country 

with whom Canada is a very important trading partner, and 

Morocco is one of the more important trading partners for 

Canada in Africa and the Middle East. 

 

The schedule that they have is a very busy one. This morning 

the Ambassador met with the Lieutenant Governor and was a 

guest of honour at a luncheon hosted by the Associate Minister 

of Health. This afternoon he will meet with the Minister of 

Economic Development, the editorial board of the Regina 

Leader-Post, and I'm pleased that I'll have an opportunity to 

meet with them as well. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to ask the members of the House to 

extend our welcome to the Ambassador and Mrs. Baddou. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, let me 

draw your attention to a number of people in your gallery as 

well, individuals from across the province representing the 

Saskatchewan Real Estate Association. And in particular I'd 

like to point out my brother, Dave, who works with Hallmark 

Realty in Saskatoon. 

 

We'd just like to welcome them to the Assembly here this 

afternoon. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 

through you to the Assembly, I would like to introduce a 

number of ladies in the west gallery that are here to observe the 

proceedings of the day. These ladies wear white ribbons, Mr. 

Speaker, to express their concern on Bill 38. 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1283 

The Speaker: — Order, order. The member from 

Souris-Cannington knows well that he is out of order. I ruled 

on that the other day, and members are not to involve our 

guests from the gallery in either debates or Bills that are on 

floor of the Assembly. 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: — Mr. Speaker, I want, on behalf of the 

government, to also welcome the . . . add my words to the 

member from Moosomin welcoming the members of the 

Saskatchewan Real Estate Association to the Assembly. 

They've been in the building today meeting with various 

members on both sides of the House and I want to extend a 

welcome on behalf of the government as well. 

 

But I also want to introduce to the Assembly, Mr. Speaker, as I 

have done three times in the past, a group of public servants 

who are here on a tour of the building. There are 25 public 

servants on this particular tour from the departments of 

Finance, Education, Environment, Energy and Mines, Social 

Services, and my own Justice department, as well as the Public 

Service Commission. 

 

The members of the tour will be in the building today finding 

out what we do and where we do it, and receiving some 

explanations as to the meaning of various parts of the 

Legislative Assembly. 

 

So I'd like, Mr. Speaker, for members of the Assembly to 

welcome the civil servants to the House today. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Serby: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I want to 

introduce to you and to members of the Assembly a group of 

students and teachers seated in the west gallery — 74 grade 7 

students from St. Alphonsus, St. Paul's, and St. Mary's schools 

in Yorkton, along with their teachers, Mr. Leroy Persick, Barb 

Zwirsky, and Steve Kozicki. One of the finest schools in 

Saskatchewan — I know that well, having two daughters who 

attend that school system. 

 

I invite all members of the Assembly to help me cover the cost 

of the juice this afternoon and to join me for refreshments later 

in room 218. 

 

So with that I welcome all members of the Assembly to join 

with me in welcoming the students and teachers and bus driver 

from Yorkton. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

I'm pleased to introduce to members of the Assembly, Ms. 

Barb Byers — I'll ask her to stand — in the gallery; and Ms. 

Jacquie Griffiths. I'll ask her to stand as well. 

 

I was unaware that this gentleman was going to be with us, but 

I'll ask Don Anderson as well to stand, if I could. 

Ms. Byers is I think known to everybody to be president of the 

Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. Jacquie Griffiths may not 

be quite as well known. She is a former member of the 

Workers' Compensation review committee and she was chair of 

the Saskatchewan federation's occupational health and safety 

committee. 

 

It, I think, is timely to welcome these two people here today, 

Mr. Speaker. Today is the day of mourning for workers who've 

been killed on the job, and the Federation of Labour played a 

major role in having this day observed today, as it is. So I know 

members will join me in a particularly warm welcome to the 

representatives of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Wiens: — Mr. Speaker, I'd like to add my words of 

welcome to all the special guests already introduced today and 

introduce to you, and through you to other members of the 

legislature, a friend of mine from Hafford, Helga Fellehner. 

Helga is a committed mother, school board member, journalist, 

and soon-to-become student, and I welcome her to the 

legislature. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Koenker: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I too 

would like to add my greetings very briefly to Jacquie 

Griffiths, and to thank her publicly for the work that she has 

done on the University of Saskatchewan campus on behalf of 

all the staff there in the field of occupational health and safety. 

I think the public of Saskatchewan owe you a real debt of 

gratitude, Jacquie, for your efforts there. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

ORAL QUESTIONS 

 

Rural Hospital Closures 

 

Mr. Martens: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question is to 

the Minister of Health. I have a letter here from a very 

concerned individual from the town of Hazlet, and her name is 

Edith Mead. A recent announcement that acute care funding for 

the Cabri Prairie Health Care Centre will be cut after 

November 30 of this year will compromise the health and 

safety of the public in a rural district. There have been many 

instances where lives have been saved because of the efforts of 

doctors, nurses, and ambulance staff based out of our hospital. 

The loss of any of these professionals or program is not 

acceptable. 

 

Madam Minister, Rolling Hills health care district comprises 

Herbert, Cabri, Gull Lake, Mankota, Ponteix, and Vanguard. 

It's 100 miles wide and 130 miles long. They have 12,000 

people, and you left them with five and a half beds. Technically 

speaking, you should have given them at least 18, under a one 

and a half per thousand. 



1284 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

My question, my question to you, Madam Minister: based on 

the fact that you left them .39 beds per thousand, .39 beds per 

thousand, what kind of medical service is going to be available 

for these people in Vanguard, in Kincaid and Ponteix and 

Mankota, when the distance they have to drive will not be less 

than 55 and as high as 130 miles for acute care service? Can 

you tell us that? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — Mr. Speaker, for the umpteenth time in 

this legislature, I'll answer the question of the member. 

 

First of all, the facilities that . . . from which in-patient acute 

care beds will be removed will still have emergency acute care. 

They will still have access to X-ray and diagnostic services in 

those facilities. There will still be other health care, broader 

health care programing that delivers other health care programs 

to the residents in that area. They will not have to do anything 

different with respect to emergency acute care, which is get 

stabilized and move on to a larger facility, which is what 

happens in virtually every case where there is a major 

emergency, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Now with respect to this district, it is not yet a district. It has 

not determined its boundaries. It does not have a district board; 

it's not in place. When the district planning group comes 

forward with its plans . . . 

 

An Hon. Member: — They have already done that, Madam 

Minister. 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — And if the member opposite would 

listen, he wouldn't have to ask the same question more than 

once. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — When the planning group comes forward 

with its plans, we will know how many beds there will be in 

the district. We will know what the services will be in that area. 

So I think as a representative from that particular area, you may 

want to encourage these communities to get into a district and 

get the needs assessment done, so we can get on with the task 

of providing better health care to rural residents. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: — Mr. Speaker, and Madam Minister, they have 

already made application to you for that district, Madam 

Minister, and those hospitals have already done that. 

 

I want to ask you another question, Madam Minister. In the 

very centre of that is the city of Swift Current. The city of 

Swift Current and three and a half municipalities comprise the 

Swift Current Union Hospital district. And that, Madam 

Minister, has about 20,000 people. They have today 78.5 or 

78.6 beds which means that they have between 18 — according 

to your figures yesterday — 18 to 28 beds too many. 

When are you going to tell the people in Swift Current that 

they have to reduce their hospital by 18 to 28 beds? When are 

you going to tell them that? 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — Mr. Speaker, there has not been a district 

board established in Swift Current and that area. This has not 

been done. There have been discussions going on. There have 

been proposals that come forward, but there is not a district 

board in place. The government has set out bed targets which 

— I've explained in this Assembly on numerous occasions — 

are only that. They are targets, and they are not carved in stone. 

They are not carved in stone. It will depend on needs. It will 

depend on the availability of community-based services. It will 

depend on what sort of district is formed. 

 

But the members opposite blindly continue to oppose the Bill 

that will allow health corporations to come together and 

improve health care in their district. They're opposing the Bill 

that will be removing the union hospital levy, a $5 million 

uploading to the provincial government . . . (inaudible) . . . the 

property tax base. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: — Mr. Speaker, and Madam Minister, the 

people in Mankota who are 130 miles away from Swift 

Current, the people who are 90 miles away from Assiniboia, or 

80 from Gravelbourg are asking this question, Madam 

Minister. If this is budgetary driven and you're going to save all 

this money, they're asking this question, because they've heard 

it from members of your department: why did you close down 

Lafleche acute care beds and are planning to put $10 million 

into a new hospital in Gravelbourg? That's the question they're 

asking me, and I want an answer from you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — Mr. Speaker, the members opposite 

know we're not putting $10 million into a new hospital in 

Gravelbourg. They know that. They know that, but oh, they 

operate on rumours and they operate on innuendoes and they 

operate on misinformation and they continue to disseminate it 

throughout the province because that's their middle name — 

the Tory misinformation party. 

 

The fact is that the members opposite are opposing legislation 

that not only gives property owners a break on their taxes 

because of the removal of the union hospital levy, but also 

opposes open and accountable funding practices for health 

boards, that requires open consultation and public health 

meetings. For the first time in the history of this province, this 

legislation is going to require health boards to have public 

meetings, to put forward their accounting, and to give the . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order. Next question. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1285 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. My 

question as well to the Minister of Health. And the question I 

have for you, Madam Minister, is based on the fact that time 

after time after time, you have heard the real concerns from the 

people of Saskatchewan, and yet, Madam Minister, you supply 

no answers. You have no reassurances for the people, Madam 

Minister. You have nothing to tell them except trust me; I 

know what I'm doing. That's what you're saying, Madam 

Minister. 

 

But, Madam Minister, what if you're wrong? What if a child 

cannot get to the hospital in time? Isn't it worth, Madam 

Minister, taking a little bit more time, slowing down this 

process, listening to the people in Saskatchewan, and making 

sure that you have answers to the questions that these people 

have? 

 

Madam Minister, there's no shame in admitting that you need 

more time. The people are willing to work with you; we are 

willing to work with you. Madam Minister, this is my question: 

will you postpone passage of the health legislation, postpone 

the closure of the 52 hospitals until the legitimate concerns of 

the people of Saskatchewan can be addressed? Will you do 

that, Madam Minister? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — Mr. Speaker, the members opposite . . . 

we are not saying, trust me. We are saying, work with us; put 

forward your plans; give us your ideas and suggestions in the 

context of the guidelines that we have set out; let's work 

together on that. And we're prepared to do that. 

 

Now with respect to whether somebody can get to a hospital on 

time. I have said again earlier today, yesterday, the day before, 

for the last two weeks — yes, these are very slow learners — 

the emergency acute care will be available in those 

communities where there are facilities wherein patient beds are 

removed. They will not have to drive any further to get to a 

hospital in order to get emergency acute care. It will be there in 

their communities. 

 

What happened in the past, Mr. Speaker, will happen 

tomorrow, which is that if there's a major farm accident, for 

example, they will go to the hospital; they'll be stabilized; 

they'll be sent on to a larger centre for surgery. That's what's 

happened in the past; that'll continue to happen before. 

 

What they won't be able to do is stay in that hospital for four or 

five days. But in an emergency situation where major surgery 

is required, that doesn't happen anyway. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Madam Minister, 

there's one fundamental flaw in your reasoning. The people 

don't believe you. The people don't believe you — that's why 

we have a thousand people on the steps of the legislature and 

literally 

thousands of letters that are coming in and literally tens of 

thousands of people on the petitions. 

 

Madam Minister, they don't believe you because you told them 

that no hospitals would be closing. Then you closed hospitals. 

You told them that decisions would be made on a local basis. 

Then you make the decisions for them. You told the people one 

thing and then you did exactly the opposite. 

 

Now I know, Madam Minister, that you are trying to emulate 

the Premier in the mode operandum that he follows. But the 

people of Saskatchewan expected more from you, Madam 

Minister. I have a letter here from a woman in Eston who 

writes simply this, a very short statement: for a minister who 

received an A rating back in September '92, I think you 

received a big red F from the people of Saskatchewan. End 

quote, Madam Minister. 

 

Madam Minister, will you postpone those hospital closures 

until some real consultation can be held? Consultations, 

Madam Minister, in which you will tell the people the truth? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — Mr. Speaker, I think the F-rating that's 

been received in this Assembly is visible right over there. 

There's the F-rating — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; that's it, 10. 

 

Mr. Speaker, with respect to the need for local boards to make 

. . . for boards to make local decisions, there is going to be lots 

of room and flexibility for local boards to come forward with 

plans to present, plans for programing, and to be involved in 

the decision-making process with respect to health reform. 

 

The members opposite stood up in this House and said: there 

are tough decisions to make out there; you're passing the buck 

to boards; you make those decisions. That's what they were 

saying a few short weeks ago. Today they're saying: oh, you 

shouldn't be making those decisions. And a few months ago 

they were saying: health reform is not moving anywhere, it's 

too slow. And today they're saying: hold it, it's going too fast. 

 

And what we get from the members opposite, they say: take the 

hospital revenue tax off, get rid of taxes on the property tax 

base. And then they vote against legislation to upload $5 

million from the property tax base. Totally inconsistent — 

that's what we get from the members opposite, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Madam Minister, 

it's painfully obvious that you were not telling the truth, and 

what you are doing now is ramming this legislation through the 

legislature before the people can really appreciate what the 

truth is and the damage that is going to be done. 

 

Mr. Speaker, members of your party, Madam Minister, 



1286 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

and members of our party were here till almost 5 o'clock in the 

morning last night debating this. So two parties were 

represented doing some work. 

 

Now, Madam Minister, you have no idea how many facilities 

will be closed. You have no idea how many jobs will be lost. 

You have no idea what the impact is going to be on 52 

communities. You have no idea which doctors will go and 

which will stay. And the people out there have some real, 

legitimate concerns about the health and safety of their 

families. And you have no answers, Madam Minister. But you 

keep charging ahead, oblivious to the concerns of the people, 

particularly in rural Saskatchewan. 

 

Madam Minister, will you show some compassion to those 

people today? Will you postpone this legislation, and will you 

postpone the closure of those 52 hospitals? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — Mr. Speaker, when the members 

opposite told their constituents and the people of Saskatchewan 

that hospital doors would be padlocked and we'd walk away 

from them, they didn't tell the truth because they knew 

otherwise because of questions they asked in here. When they 

told people there would be no emergency acute care in this 

hospital, they weren't telling the truth because there will be 

emergency acute care in those facilities. When they told the 

people of Saskatchewan, when they told them that they would 

have to drive hundreds of miles to see a doctor, half bleeding to 

death, they weren't telling the truth, Mr. Speaker. They were 

misleading the people because they knew from the answers in 

this House that those services were going to be provided. 

 

And when they told the public in 1986 that they only had a 

deficit of some 400 million and after the election they said, 

whoops, it's 1.2 billion, Mr. Speaker, they did not tell the truth, 

and they were dishonest with the public. And that's my 

response to the member opposite. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — Before I recognize the next questioner, I want 

to make two points: members are getting very, very close to 

unparliamentary language and I ask them to please hold back a 

bit and get back to parliamentary language; and secondly, 

please let's stop the interruptions either when the question is 

asked or when the minister is trying to answer. Order. Every 

time you interrupt there'll be more time taken off. 

 

SEDCO Appointments 

 

Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 

question is for the Minister of Economic Development, 

although recently, Mr. Speaker, the only thing the minister has 

been developing is a healthy list of employment opportunities 

for NDP (New Democratic Party) Party hacks at the public 

expense. 

 

Mr. Minister, in November of last year in an article headlined: 

From the Minister's Mouth — appeared in Sask Report — 

when the reporter asked you directly if there would be any 

political patronage in SEDCO (Saskatchewan Economic 

Development Corporation), you said, and I quote: 

 

 What we have done with SEDCO since the election is 

indicate there will be no political influence on the board or 

management by any politician or board member. This is 

absolute and clear. 

 

Mr. Minister, given this statement, how can you possible 

justify hiring your personal friend, your associate, your former 

political employee, and long-time NDP supporter as 

vice-president of SEDCO? Because the only thing, Mr. 

Minister, that is absolute and clear, is that is political 

patronage, what you did. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much. I want to 

thank the member from Kindersley for the courtesy of that 

question after having been informed that the minister was 

suffering from laryngitis. Thank you for your courtesy. 

 

I want, Mr. Speaker, I want to make a comment before I speak 

to . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. I know the member from 

Estevan would really like to get up and ask a question, but I 

think he's got to consult with his caucus. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Mr. Speaker, the approach of the 

opposition to the area of SEDCO is strange indeed. Firstly, 

they are very critical of SEDCO for losses which they 

themselves triggered with their own hare-brained schemes. 

Then they are even more vehemently critical of us as we try to 

clean up the mess. 

 

Let me turn to Mr. Zach Douglas. Mr. Zach Douglas is a 

person who has worked for the provincial government in the 

'70s; he has worked for the federal government; he has been in 

private business. After all that was under his belt, he then went 

back to university and got a law degree. 

 

I say to members opposite, if you had appointed people of this 

quality to SEDCO, we wouldn't have the mess to clean up that 

we do now. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Boyd: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With 

answers like that, I'm not surprised you don't have laryngitis as 

well, sir. 

 

Mr. Minister, Mr. Minister, yesterday you were caught firing 

capable people from SEDCO in order to make 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1287 

room for political appointments, political friends. 

 

I watched the minister's performance on the 6 o'clock news last 

night, and because of your . . . and trying to defend his actions. 

And it was just absolutely sorrowful, your performance, the 

type of performance you put on. Perhaps, perhaps, Mr. 

Minister, you should take some pointers from the Premier, who 

is far better at telling several different versions of the truth than 

you are. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Boyd: — Perhaps, Mr. Minister, you could rise in the 

Assembly and give your solemn pledge, as the Minister of 

Justice did last fall when he said he will be making . . . he said, 

we will be making appointments in the best interests of all 

people, not in the best interests of our political friends. 

 

These comments, Mr. Minister, ring very hollow today after 

we've seen your recent actions. Perhaps, perhaps, Mr. Minister, 

you could renew your pledge with respect to political patronage 

to the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

Members opposite should have little difficulty recognizing a 

sorrowful experience. They've been engaging in that over the 

last six weeks. 

 

Mr. Speaker, with respect to the appointments, I would point 

out to the members opposite, as they well know but choose to 

ignore, these were appointments made by the very able 

chairman, Susan Strelioff, who is president of SEDCO. 

 

They include Michael Fix. These appointments, as well, 

include Brent Krajewski . . . 

 

An Hon. Member: — Krajewski. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Krajewski. Thank you. Mr. Speaker, 

Mr. Speaker . . . 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — Order. Next question. Next question. 

 

Government Tendering Practices 

 

Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question will 

be to the minister responsible for Gaming. But I would say to 

the members of the treasury benches over there, they should at 

least pronounce the name of their employees right. 

 

Mr. Minister, Mr. Minister responsible for Gaming in the 

province, you had the courage last Thursday to get up and 

answer a question which you had taken notice of. It would have 

been far more impressive, Mr. Minister, had you provided the 

thoughts and the answers on the actual question that was asked, 

though. 

The question asked was: why was the photocopying tender and 

so many other government tenders subject to closed bidding? 

Now why aren't those bids open publicly, Mr. Minister, as they 

have been in the past and as tenders should be? And how can 

you call this an open process when the bids are opened behind 

closed doors, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In 

response to the Leader of the Opposition's question, let me 

point out that the request for proposals came through within the 

neighbourhood of 2,800 different options. As I indicated in my 

note to him, that the Property Management Corporation wanted 

the time and the opportunity to assess the different proposals. 

There were proposals for leases. There were proposals for lease 

purchases, and there were proposals for straight-out purchases. 

 

And I indicate to you, sir, that there were 2,800 different 

options that they were going to assess. Now after the 

assessment process is complete, these results would be open to 

any of the people who put forth a proposal to have a look at the 

winners, and that is the process that was chosen. It was a fair 

and it was an advertised operation, and I think the member 

knows quite clearly that it is a fair process. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Question to the 

same minister. Mr. Minister, you know full well what the 

public are saying about that process. They don't like it. That's 

why they're calling the opposition and saying that this 

government is closed, after all the promises that you made. I 

mean, Mr. Minister, this is like having an election where 

everyone gets to vote but only you get to go behind the closed 

doors and count the votes and then come out and tell us who 

won. Mr. Minister, no one in this province would consider that 

to be an open and fair election. No one in this province thinks 

that that is an open and fair tendering process, Mr. Minister. 

 

In today's paper we see how your government has been caught 

trying to hide information by its own freedom of information 

laws for the second straight year. That's the commissioner's 

words, Mr. Minister. Now you're trying to hide by instituting 

this highly unethical practice of opening bids behind closed 

doors. Would you change it, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the 

member opposite that he knows full well that this proposal was 

advertised in all of the major papers across this province. 

 

We invited the major suppliers of photocopiers to put forth 

proposals with respect to leases, with respect to lease 

purchases, and with respect to an option of outright purchases. 

He knows full well we were asking them to put their best foot 

forward, to put forth a proposal that could be reviewed by the 

Property Management Corporation so that we could assess 

which in fact was the best value for the dollars that the 



1288 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

people of Saskatchewan would spend for those products. He 

knows full well that the invitation was open. 

 

He knows full well, as I've indicated to him, that there were 

about 2,800 different options that government was reviewing. 

And after the review process is complete, Mr. Speaker, I 

indicate to the member one more time, that all of the people 

who had put forth a proposal are more than willing to look at 

all of the different options and have a look at the ones that we 

accepted and have a look at the ones we rejected. 

 

We do not operate like that former administration did, Mr. 

Speaker. This is a government that believes in fair and open 

tendering, and you will see that process continue throughout 

the term of this government. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Question to the 

same minister. Mr. Minister, if you were truly open, you'd be 

out there trying to help people instead of doing things behind 

closed doors. You guys spent so much time covering up tracks, 

that's what people are upset about. Your minister of SEDCO 

appoints his hack and then has to go out and cover it up in front 

of the media. 

 

The Premier makes speeches in New York about farm income 

and then has to come in here and cover up his tracks. The 

Deputy Premier breaks the freedom of information rules. Mr. 

Minister, it's the covering up of all these dubious things that 

have people upset. 

 

We just had a spraying contract in this legislature brought up 

— $150,000 shot because you went to the top bidder, Mr. 

Minister. 

 

Now why do you continue to hide behind closed doors if, you 

as you say, there's nothing to hide. Why don't you end this 

questionable practice? Stand on your feet today and say there 

will not be another tender opened behind closed doors in this 

province. Do that, sir. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the 

Leader of the Opposition, that from any other political party or 

any other political organization, a question in good faith may 

have some credibility, but not from that opposition, not from 

that member who was part and parcel of the most corrupt 

administration in the history of this province. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — I say to you, Mr. Speaker, this is 

not a government that will cut loan deals on a golf course for 

$100,000 for friends of a government. This is not that kind of a 

government. 

 

And I'll tell you, Mr. Speaker, this is not the kind of a 

government who will allow a chief executive officer, without 

the authorization of a board, to cut an over $4 

million deal, a contract, for a service that may not be even 

produced by the contractor. I say to you, Mr. Speaker, that this 

government is committed to an open, and we're committed to 

an honest, tendering system, as was done with respect to the 

photocopy tender that was put out by Property Management 

Corporation. And I say shame on that member for even 

standing up in this legislature and talking about fairness. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 

 

Day of Commemoration 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 

I rise today on the day of mourning to ask the Assembly to join 

with me in recognizing workers in Saskatchewan who have 

been killed or injured on the job. I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, 

that for this issue it seems we can set aside our partisan 

differences. I see members of all political parties in the 

Assembly recognizing this day by the badge they wear. 

 

Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan's rate of workplace accidents and 

deaths is higher than it should be. In the last year, 19 workers 

lost their lives to workplace accidents, and a total of 32,447 

claims were filed with the Workers' Compensation Board; 

12,000 of those claims were lost-time injuries. 

 

While it's not possible to prevent every accident from 

occurring, I believe that the province's Occupational Health and 

Safety Act has not gone as far in the past as it should have to 

protect workers' health and their lives. Aside from the horrible 

human cost of death and serious accidents, there is also a 

financial cost to the workers' compensation fund. 

 

I will later, Mr. Speaker, under the appropriate place in routine 

proceedings, be giving first reading to amendments to The 

Occupational Health and Safety Act to strengthen the 

protection given to employers and make the workplace more 

safe. I will also, Mr. Speaker, under the same item get into 

some amendments to the workers' compensation legislation 

which will make the whole scheme much more fair for 

workers. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Before concluding, Mr. Speaker, I 

want to note one fact, and that is someone who more than 

anyone else was author of this particular day. The member 

from Moose Jaw Palliser was one of the first members in my 

memory to actually see a private members' Bill passed in the 

House. That was done. And Saskatchewan thereupon became 

the first province in Canada to recognize a day of mourning — 

something, Mr. Speaker, that I might add to the considerable 

credit of that member, has spread across Canada. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1289 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Mr. Speaker, I know all members 

will want to join with me in recognizing this day and in paying 

homage to the workers that it represents. Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is indeed sad to 

see, Mr. Speaker, such an important issue being used as a 

partisan political tool by members of the government. Mr. 

Speaker, today we mark our respect and compassion for injured 

workers. And I want to say that I believe it is very important 

for us to do this at this time. Much work is very dangerous, Mr. 

Speaker, and as a society becomes more complex when we 

consider the dangers that are out in our society . . . And here 

I'm thinking of everything from nurses who are subject to 

physical assault to computer technicians being exposed to 

potential harmful emissions. 

 

I think of people in the town of Coronach who will be working 

in the SaskPower facilities producing the electricity for the 

people of Saskatchewan, now facing accidents with no 

hospital, at a cost of life and limb. 

 

But the fact is, Mr. Speaker, that in our province the most 

dangerous occupation continues to be agriculture. Farming is 

not only a high-risk business economically, it is a high-risk 

work in terms of health and safety. And while we must 

continue to do all that we can to promote and enhance safety 

among the blue-collar workers, I am convinced that there is not 

near enough effort by government to enhance the health and 

safety of those who work in agriculture in our province. 

 

And I must say that it is sad indeed that we may see the 

facilities from farm accidents increasing over the next several 

years as immediate emergency assistance becomes ever harder 

to obtain with the closure of many rural hospital facilities. 

These are real issues and they must not be swept aside in 

partisan bickering. 

 

Mr. Speaker, while farmers go into spring seeding, I implore 

them to exercise every caution. And I say to them, please be 

careful in the next weeks as you become overtired and anxious 

to make your living. 

 

I specifically wish to communicate to workers around the 

province in the coalmines and on the oil rigs, by the assembly 

line, or in front of the furnace: please make yourself aware of 

the risks of the workplace that you're in and take the necessary 

precautions. 

 

I also want to make the observation, Mr. Speaker, that far too 

often government sets workers' safety issues up as an area of 

confrontation between the workers and the employers, and all 

of our people should understand that this is just not the case. 

 

The average employer in the province of Saskatchewan is 

actually concerned for his workers' safety. Aside from the fact 

that our business community is a mirror reflection of our 

working community — good, decent people — aside from that, 

Mr. Speaker, the employer who is not concerned 

for his worker is an employer that will not long be in business. 

 

So let us not use this occasion to create division but to urge all 

people to work together to improve safety, prevent accidents, 

and to enhance the conditions of work for all. To those families 

that have suffered from work-related injuries, our heart goes 

out to them. God be with you. 

 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — Does the member from Saskatoon Greystone 

have leave to respond? 

 

Leave granted. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is an honour 

to rise and add my few remarks regarding injured workers day. 

We all long for the day when workplaces are without the perils 

of accidents and injuries, and we should strive to avoid 

situations where employees, men and women with families to 

support and loved ones who rely upon them, are placed in 

unnecessary danger. 

 

To accomplish this it would seem appropriate that government 

would become its own example, and projects like the Shand 

power station and the NewGrade Energy upgrader were 

significant government projects, Mr. Speaker. Both of these 

unfortunately involved serious workplace accidents. 

 

On this solemn day I am equally concerned, as voiced by my 

colleague, for the many farm families of our province — 

families who are approaching a season filled with endless hours 

of work. And statistics show that there are five times the 

number of accidents and injuries amongst farm families in our 

province compared to any other occupation that exists in 

Canada. A serious risk indeed. 

 

In closing, Mr. Speaker, we grieve for those who have lost 

loved ones and for those whose quality of life has been 

diminished by having to cope with the effects of injuries. And 

to those people we say: courage, our prayers and concerns are 

with you as you struggle with your challenges and sorrows. 

 

Thank you very much. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you. I'm going to ask for 

leave, Mr. Speaker, to revert to introduction of guests. So I'll do 

that first. 

 

Leave granted. 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you. I introduced earlier, Mr. 

Speaker, because I was facing her, the president of the 

Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. 



1290 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

All of these matters ought to be partnerships between 

employers and employees. 

 

I'm very pleased to notice just behind me, I just now see Del 

Robertson of the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce and 

Jim Chase of the Saskatchewan Construction Association. And 

the . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Right, the representatives of 

the UFCW (United Food and Commercial Workers) who are 

sitting in . . . the RWDSU (Retail, Wholesale and Department 

Store Union) rather, are sitting in front of them. 

 

I would ask members to join me in welcoming these people. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Goohsen: — I'd like to echo the sentiments. 

 

The Speaker: — Does the member have leave? 

 

Leave granted. 

 

Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I certainly want to 

join with the Minister of Labour. As the critic for Labour in our 

caucus, I want to say that we are truly happy to see Jim Chase 

and Del Robertson and the other folks that were introduced up 

in the gallery today taking in the important issues that will 

come before the Assembly today. 

 

And of course the folks that represent the labour movement, we 

would also like to welcome them here. We're sure that in a 

spirit of cooperation that we can all get together and make 

Saskatchewan truly a better place to work in and a better place 

to live. Thank you for coming. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Finally, Mr. Speaker, in my capacity 

as I guess Acting House Leader, it's been traditional at this time 

. . . After the ministerial statement, it's been a tradition of past 

years to observe a brief moment of silence, somewhat akin to 

what's done on Remembrance Day, for deceased workers. I 

would ask for leave therefore to observe that custom again, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

Leave granted. 

 

The Assembly observed a moment of silence.

ORDERS OF THE DAY 



1294 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

SPECIAL ORDER 

 

THIRD READINGS 

 

Bill No. 3 — An Act respecting Health Districts 

 

Hon. Ms. Simard: — Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a motion 

that the Bill be read a third time and passed under its title. 

 

Mr. Devine: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am receiving a 

great deal of public support to speak against this Bill. And 

unfortunately we only have 20 minutes because we are limited 

in our time to debate on behalf of people because, for whatever 

reason, the NDP administration is afraid to listen to the people 

and is hiding behind closure. They won't let the people debate 

it or provide alternative suggestions. 

 

And particularly in this Legislative Assembly they've decided 

now this Assembly isn't even for debate on real issues. And this 

is a fairly real issue. It has the lives at stake and the families at 

stake and the communities at stake. And the NDP says, no it's 

not really important. It's only health care and it's only your 

community and it's only your life, but we won't debate it. We'll 

cut you off. 

 

I raise that despite the fact that I only have 19 minutes left to 

speak because I just find it deplorable that we're going to 

address this Bill, under these conditions, that has such wide and 

sweeping possible changes, and there's absolutely no guarantee 

that they know what they're doing. 

 

The government plan just might not work. People might 

experience increased risk of life and limb, and clearly their 

communities could be in severe danger. And what if this 

doesn't work? What will happen to these communities? What 

will happen to their livelihoods? 

 

I've put together, Mr. Speaker, a combination of some of the 

items that the NDP administration has done to communities 

and how they are beginning to feel. Because it's more than just 

the wellness plan that is in this Bill. It is an entire strategy of 

centralization and control and an attack on communities where 

people have lived since they've homesteaded at the turn of the 

century. And most interestingly, it's the smaller, more 

vulnerable communities. 

 

A lady put it to me this way. She said, how would you feel if 

these people who wanted centralization and control did the 

following. How would you feel if you were living in a rural 

community and you thought you had universal health care and 

you thought that you had a good, supportive, compassionate 

government, and you voted for that party that said that it was 

going to stick up for health care and stick up for rural people 

and stick up for public employees, and this is what's happened 

to you? 

 

And she read it to me and she said, how would you feel if first 

they took 

away the children's dental plan, then they took away our dental 

plan, then they took away our optometric and our chiropractic 

coverage, then they took away our prescription drug plan, then 

they took away the insulin and oxygen coverage, then they 

decided to close my hospital, then they took away the local 

jobs, because then they took away my doctor. And because 

there was no doctor, they took away employees that are 

working in labs. And then they took away the pharmacist. And 

then they took away the roads that were paved. And then as 

we've seen, well we'll take away the bus service. And then they 

will take away the schools. 

 

And the NDP member from Humboldt says, this is a fairy tale. 

Every single, solitary one of these items that this lady has 

mentioned to me has been enacted by the NDP — every one of 

them. 

 

Then they took away from my seniors. They not only took 

away the comfort of health care and acute care and seniors' 

care, but they took away the seniors' heritage program for low 

income people. And then they took away the seniors' home 

because people would not retire in the community. Then they 

took away my farm support programs. And obviously they've 

taken away GRIP (gross revenue insurance program). They've 

taken away any sort of harmonized tax benefits for agriculture 

and small business. 

 

And then she says, Mr. Speaker, and finally they just took 

away the town. And then she added, what is left for you to 

take? What's left after you've done all those things? What more 

could you do to them? And then she remembered, oh yes, now 

you could take away my riding and take away my vote. 

 

Now what a tragedy. Because every one of these items that this 

lady has given to me has taken place by the NDP, the NDP 

who say they are from the CCF (Co-operative Commonwealth 

Federation) and who have compassion, want universal health 

care, help farmers, help public employees, and they've attacked 

every single, solitary thing that this woman has said. And that's 

her very life since her parents homesteaded there. 

 

And she said, at the very end, after you've taken away all these 

services and closed my hospital, closed the school, ripped up 

the roads, taken away the bus service, taken away my farm 

support programs, and I've lost my senior citizens' home 

because there's no confidence at all for seniors to retire there 

without help and without doctors, then you finally take away 

my town. 

 

And she said, and what's left? What's left? Well I guess they 

could take away the riding because there won't be the people, 

and then we won't have the vote. They've taken away our 

franchise; that's what's left. 

 

Here is an NDP administration who says this is the wellness 

model and they've taken away everything. And finally when 

there's nobody left, they can say, well for centralization and 

control purposes, we'll take away your vote. There's only a 

handful of people there. They don't count. Obviously they 

moved to Alberta or moved some other place or moved to the 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1295 

city. 

 

And then she went on. So if this is the plan for rural 

Saskatchewan, because all these things have taken place and 

costs have certainly increased, then she says, how are we 

doing? Well I'll tell you, I provided her with the information 

that is in the newspapers and I said, well in the farm 

community, their income this year is supposed to be net 

$5,000. In fact they almost get twice as much income off the 

farm as they do on the farm now in the province of 

Saskatchewan under the NDP administration, and no support. 

 

And if you go into the cities, Saskatoon Star-Phoenix had it 

published very clearly, what have you got? — 450 per cent 

increase in those going to food banks. Retail sales are down. 

Number of people on welfare is up 18 per cent. The business 

community is saying it's worse than we thought — much, much 

worse. The NDP non-plan, or now it's being revealed as 

centralization control, is devastating. 

 

And when we want to talk about it and tell them about their 

mistakes and go through what they've done, they say no, we'll 

just hush you up in the legislature because maybe we'll cut off 

your franchise out in the country, maybe you won't be able to 

get your vote. 

 

But even if you did make it in here, let me tell you folks what 

they do. They limit your time to speak on something as 

important as your community or health care or GRIP or farm 

support or taxation. In the last session we even had a minister 

of Finance who stood in his place and would not even answer 

questions when he wanted interim supply. First time it's ever 

happened in Saskatchewan legislature. 

 

Last time we were in here they voted even without the 

opposition. They said, we don't need opposition, we'll just do it 

our way. Never ever happened before. But under this bunch it 

happens. 

 

(1545) 

 

So even if you happen to get elected, they just cut you off in 

here too. Arrogant, deceiving, and now betrayal. The NDP 

administration has betrayed people, rural and urban, so that 

unions are upset; pensioners are upset; farmers are angry; 

taxpayers are angry; Indian and native people, frustrated and 

angry; the business community, no confidence; the bond rating 

institution says you got a BBB. 

 

So who are you pleasing? What's happening here that we have 

to be in such a hurry for your grand plan? Isn't it ironic that 

they have to cut off debate because they're so proud of their 

plan. They're not proud of it. They just want to get it done. And 

as the Associate Minister of Health said, well we don't have all 

the answers, but after we do this a while it'll kind of work out. 

We'll know a little bit better how it's going to work. 

 

That's what they got for the people. I can remember asking 

them, do you have a plan? Mr. Member from Riversdale, do 

you have a plan? What will you do if 

you get elected? You promised big tax cuts and lots of money 

for health and education. How will you do it, sir? Oh I don't 

have to tell you; I'll just, he said, I'll just manage a little bit 

better, and I'll open the books and everything will be fine. 

 

He opened the books, and he found the same deficit that we 

had. And then he went on to say, well I'll do it my way. And if 

we had a farm protection program, he'd take it away. If we 

opened a hospital, he'd close it. If we initiated a development 

program, he'd cut it off. If we say harmonize, he'd do the 

opposite. 

 

And what have we got? We've got people writing in saying, 

how would you feel if they took away your child's dental plan 

and took away your prescription drug plan, took away your 

support, took away your doctor, took away your hospital, took 

away your nursing home, then took away your pension plan, 

and took my school and your senior citizens' home, your farm 

support programs, they took away your children because they 

moved, and finally they took away your town. How would you 

feel? 

 

What's left to take? Just your vote. Just your franchise. Just 

your hope. Because as sure as I'm standing here, Mr. Speaker, 

there will be an excuse come from the Premier's office — well 

for efficiency reasons and because the population has gone 

down in rural Saskatchewan due to the wellness program, we 

will have to take away rural ridings. And we'll have to cut them 

probably by 10. So people won't get a chance to vote against 

the NDP administration because that's the excuse they used to 

take away the GRIP program, the excuse they used to close 52 

hospitals. 

 

And believe me, they're closing. The hospital is gone. The 

doctor is gone. Don't let the Minister of Health or the Premier 

give you the New York line that, oh the door is still open and 

there'll still be something going on there. Well it ain't a 

hospital. And it ain't a doctor. And they'll drive hundreds of 

miles. 

 

Well it's pathetic that we have to be here under a time 

constraint to look at this massive social engineering for 

centralization and control done by a socialist government. 

Bring everything to the middle. Control all the boards. Control 

all the people. Tell them, tell them that they're doing it for 

themselves. 

 

And I'll tell you, they're fooling nobody. Look what the 

Star-Phoenix says, Mr. Speaker. It's a farce. That's what it says. 

They'd get much higher marks if he just told the truth. The 

local people have nothing to do with this, absolutely nothing. 

 

And the paper, in the editorial, which generally are pretty 

supportive of the NDP, says your tactics are a farce. In other 

words, it says you're not telling the truth. You're not fooling 

anybody. This is the New York story. The New York story is, 

oh yes, we're doing this, and we have great popular support. 

And oh yes, by the way, says the Premier, quoted in CP 

(Canadian Press), farm income is way up. People are happy 

with the hospitals closing. Oh, it's very nice. 



1296 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

Well that isn't what the editorial says. The editorial says that 

you're not telling the truth, and it's a farce. That's what the NDP 

whole wellness model is. 

 

And the second farce is that you have to rush through this 

House to get on with it when you know that it's full of all this 

risk and all these mistakes. Because what if somebody doesn't 

make it through your health care program? What if people 

suffer life and liberty, risk, as a result of your program? What if 

towns do go through what this lady has said? It will be on your 

conscience and your political head. 

 

And you don't even have the courtesy and the decency to listen 

to the people speak out. They drove for hundreds and hundreds 

of miles to the steps of the legislature here, got up at 5 in the 

morning. And the minister goes out to meet them, says a little 

speech, and comes back in here, hides in the House, and then 

up to her office. 

 

And they said, well for heaven's sake, doesn't she think that we 

took a long time to speak to her? She said, well I've got to go 

for question period. Well heaven's sake. They said, if the 

Premier and the Finance minister can be in New York and miss 

question period for five days, you'd think when the people of 

Saskatchewan who are having their communities shut down 

come to this Legislative Assembly — because it is theirs, not 

the NDP's — that the NDP cabinet ministers responsible for 

this could at least stay out there and listen to their suggestions 

and talk to them and listen and give them suggestions on what 

they could do. 

 

But no. They say one thing in New York and another thing 

here. They say one thing prior to an election campaign, 

something else different. They say something else in the 

country and something else in the city. They've got so many 

versions of the truth. 

 

They've even got several copies that their press secretaries hand 

out now — a copy for the New York people, a little different 

copy for the Toronto people, and a little different copy for the 

legislature, and a little different story and a little different paper 

for the country. 

 

And what is the media saying? It's a farce. It's pathetic. As if 

we're supposed to believe that you . . . well I just had this little 

trial paper in New York that didn't quite go for it. You've got a 

BBB and you've added 1.6 billion to the deficit and to the debt. 

That's more in your 16 months than we added in our last two 

years of our government or the first two. 

 

So you've got more taxes, bigger taxes, broadened PST 

(provincial sales tax). And you've added to the debt 1.6 billion, 

and you've cut all these rural communities and you haven't 

saved enough to amount to more than 1.3 per cent of your 

health budget. And you have no confidence that the people 

believe that you know what you're doing. Because when you're 

asked in here to talk about it in second reading, well I kind of 

think if we just kind of get a crack at this we'll know a little bit 

better after six 

months on how it's all going to work. 

 

Imagine! Taking away your doctor and your hospital, your bus 

service, your roads, your farm support programs, your seniors' 

heritage program, your prescription drug, and you say, well I 

don't really know the impact on your community but give us a 

few months and it will probably all become clear. And then we 

can't talk about it. 

 

I didn't think you'd do this. I didn't think you'd even believe 

anybody who would say you had to do this. You're not even 

saving that much money. Do you know what you're going to be 

into now? As I'm standing here, sure as we're shooting, you're 

going to be into, well, the new harmonization of the tax system. 

You'll broaden it even more. And oh, we'll have to harmonize; 

we'll have to go back on it; maybe we'll have a little wrinkle 

here. Probably an inheritance tax and probably just some really 

Draconian things that you're going to do in legislation that's 

going to cost the business and small business and farmers just 

all kinds of money. 

 

And you're going to think this encourages the economy? 

Saskatchewan will have a good reputation? You'll have all 

these happy communities? 

 

Listen to what the media says again: the NDP is losing 

credibility on health care. Well you certainly don't have it in 

agriculture. You don't have it in the business community. 

You're not known as the free enterprisers, the market people. 

You don't do public share offerings. 

 

So if you don't have it in agriculture and you don't have it in the 

business community, and you don't have it among seniors 

because you took away their pension plan and took away their 

prescription drug plan, you don't have it among the taxpayers 

because you're ripping them off, and you don't have it among 

Indian and native people because you've been at war with them 

politically, and now you're losing your credibility on health 

care, no wonder they say that whoever designed this whole 

plan must have had, you know, mud up here. 

 

That's what the paper is saying. A supportive NDP paper says 

the NDP is losing credibility on health care. And a little bit 

later it says your wellness model is a farce. And it says — this 

is again from the Star-Phoenix — if the hospital is shut down, 

can the school be far behind? 

 

Well you know the rippling effect. You close your elevator. 

You close your school. You close your hospital. The town's 

gone. The church closes. Seniors won't retire there if there's no 

support mechanisms. 

 

So here you are. And you say, oh that won't be the case; it'll 

magically survive. Agriculture is going to be really strong, and 

then you come to find out agriculture income is cut by 56 to 60 

per cent. Well then that isn't working. So you asked yourself, 

what in the world have you got going for you? Why did you get 

elected? Why did you run? What was the reason to 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1297 

run? For what, for who? For your community? Because you're 

going to reduce the debt? You've added to the debt $1.6 billion. 

You're going to help taxes. You've raised taxes. I can't figure it 

out, and the people can't figure it out. What in the world are 

you doing? There's no rhyme or reason to this. 

 

Your credit rating is going down. The debt's going up. Taxes 

are going up. Communities are going down. Population is 

falling. Retail sales are going down, food banks up by 450 per 

cent, and you've got a plan. You couldn't go for dog catcher 

with this unless you had just die-hards who said, well I guess 

I'll just go with you because oh they're . . . after months and 

months it will probably kind of work out. 

 

Well do you know what it looks like? It looks like you just 

wanted to get elected because, well, you're on one side, and 

we're on the other. Just go for it, and you'll get elected, and 

then you get to sit on that side and play government and go to a 

cabinet meeting, and then you can have centralization and 

control because that's what you really believe in. Deep, deep 

down in your heart, you want centralization and control. 

 

Then it's interesting to note, while my remarks are focused on 

smaller communities, the threatened changes to urban hospitals 

have nurses and doctors and support staff and patients and 

others with much anxiety. They don't think that you really 

know what you're doing in Prince Albert. They don't think that 

you really know what you're doing in the consolidation of 

services here where you're going to spend something like $100 

million dollars on new health care facilities here, and 

supposedly close one over here that the NDP built. 

 

Wasn't it the NDP that built the Plains Health Centre? The 

NDP built the new Plains Health Centre for largely rural people 

on the edge of . . . Mr. Speaker, were you the minister? No, you 

weren't the minister. You would even deny it ever happened, 

right . . . (inaudible) . . . The Plains Health Centre, built by the 

NDP, now the NDP are going to close that and spend $100 

million on new facilities . . . 

 

An Hon. Member: — They'll blame it on Walter. 

 

Mr. Devine: — Oh they'll blame it on the media. Media must 

have got it wrong. And the same in Saskatoon. They don't 

believe you know what you're doing. Dr. Baltzan says it 

threatens St. Paul's very existence. These people don't know 

what they're doing. 

 

Well we have, Mr. Speaker, accumulated thousands and 

literally tens of thousands of petitions from rural and urban 

people who said: please give us the time — we've read the 

petitions, Mr. Speaker — please give us the time to talk to you 

about this approach. We don't believe that you have figured it 

out. We don't believe that you know what you're doing 

necessarily. And no disrespect, these people are vote 

everything. They said: I want to be convinced that you know 

what you're doing, that you're actually saving some money, that 

it will actually work. 

And today we're going to see third reading; we can't talk about 

it any more. Well believe me, Mr. Speaker, we'll be talking 

about it. We'll be talking about the things that I mention here 

today. You can shut us up in here, as I think the member from 

Moose Jaw something-or-other said the last time that he spoke 

on closure. He said: you can stop us in here but you can't stop 

people speaking in their homes and in restaurants and in 

churches and in the ball diamonds and in the hockey rinks — 

we'll speak. 

 

And the people will speak as they spoke out here in the 

legislature and they went home more angry than they arrived, 

because there is no justification for what you're doing, 

absolutely none. You're not saving any money. You're 

spending $100 million just in this city alone, in Regina, over 

the next five years and you might save 5 million this year and 

then maybe 20 thereafter if you close all 52 rural hospitals. 

Show us the savings. 

 

And then you've got the Taj Mahal out here that the NDP built, 

the Plains Centre — you're going to close it. I don't figure out 

how you're going to do that if all these people are going to 

come to Regina because they won't have rural facilities. What 

are they going to do? They're going to be lined up? Where are 

they going to get served? 

 

And the seniors aren't going to retire in these rural 

communities; they're going to have to come in here. 

 

An Hon. Member: — No, they're going to Alberta and B.C. 

(British Columbia). 

 

Mr. Devine: — Well a lot of them are going out of the 

province and they're going to retire in British Columbia; they're 

going to retire in Alberta. They're not going to retire here. And 

young people are saying: I never, ever would have thought the 

NDP were like this. 

 

And on top of it — it's ironic — they're adding to the deficit, 

they're adding to the debt. They've added over a billion dollars 

to the debt and they won't even admit that. Not one of them 

will stand up and say, well yes, that's true, we added to the 

debt. We've added almost a billion and a half to the debt in all 

of our magic. 

 

And by the time you get around to balancing the budget you'll 

have added several billion to the debt. And you're complaining 

about interest on the debt now. Well the interest on the debt 

will be that much bigger because of you guys and your 

wellness model and your agriculture model and your business 

model. 

 

(1600) 

 

In fact what the rating institutions are telling you, because 

they've told our people, is that they think the Saskatchewan 

economy is in tough shape. They think that just maybe there 

isn't the confidence in the business sector for reinvestment, just 

maybe people won't come here to spend their money, just 

maybe young people and businesses will leave, as they've 



1298 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

been doing. Maybe the farm economy won't turn around, 

maybe the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) 

stuff is not going to be resolved. And if you looked at Congress 

in the United States, you'd have to be pessimistic on the price 

of wheat. 

 

But what if all that comes true under your model and your 

credit rating stays low and you add to the debt all because you 

wouldn't admit, you wouldn't admit that you've misled the 

public, that you had no idea what you were doing, and you 

walked into office and said, well gee, now we better figure out 

something; we got elected. 

 

Well, Mr. Speaker, it's a sad day in this Legislative Assembly 

when we have to see this undemocratic process by the New 

Democratic Party to stop debate and to limit debate on a Bill 

and on a procedure that is absolutely historic in this province. 

 

And the Premier stands up and he says, but this is historic, this 

is historic. Boy, he says, I'll be just like Tommy Douglas. They 

took it on in '44 and now me, as man from Riversdale, will take 

it on in '93, and I'll look just like Tommy. Isn't that . . . You 

listen to him. And he gets you all clapping. You say, oh yes, 

he'll look just like Tommy because he'll have taken on this big 

challenge. And what if it doesn't work? What if Tommy 

actually had a plan? 

 

And the man from Riversdale, what if he didn't have one? 

What if he has no idea what's going to happen? And he wants 

to go down in history as the man who could dazzle them with 

all his footwork and tell them one thing in New York and 

another thing out here in Saskatchewan. But what if his plan to 

be in the history books like Tommy Douglas isn't right? What 

if there's no substance in the plan? What if it's just a dream of 

his, a personal, pie-in-the-sky dream of this man who wanted to 

be Premier since he was six years old? 

 

What if that's all it's about and you are just following him 

anyway, and your town goes down and your community goes 

down, and the budget isn't balanced and the deficit goes up and 

the debt goes up and the confidence is lost and the population 

disappeared? Well those are the questions that people are 

asking because they are realizing that there's several versions 

from the truth come out of the man from Riversdale and several 

other people. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I'm going to close my remarks by saying we 

obviously join with the people of Saskatchewan in opposing 

this Draconian Bill, this unfair attack on people — taxpayers, 

seniors, farmers, and good Saskatchewan people all across the 

province. 

 

And I for one, Mr. Speaker, will be making sure that after I 

vote against this, that people will continue to know the truth 

about the NDP and their betrayal of the socialist trust, the CCF 

trust, and just the non-partisan trust that people put in them. 

Mr. Speaker, this Bill deserves to fail. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I'm 

going to rise one last time and debate on this Bill. And it's not 

really a debate, Mr. Speaker, that we've been going through on 

Bill 3; this is simply a large NDP government forcing upon the 

people of Saskatchewan their idea of health reform. There's 

been no debate anywhere in this province, Mr. Speaker, that 

amounts to anything of substance. 

 

And I would quote from the Star-Phoenix of April 21, 1993. 

And it says: 

 

 In the wake of this announcement, Simard is still claiming 

local control means something. By taking away acute care 

money, the government is merely "asking" the hospitals and 

district boards to "consider a role change." 

 

 Sure. And having someone walk the plank is merely inviting 

that person to take a stroll in the fresh, tangy air of the open 

sea. 

 

Mr. Speaker, that quote from April 21 in the Saskatoon 

Star-Phoenix sums up what people all over this province are 

feeling about Bill 3. 

 

Last week, Mr. Speaker, I took the opportunity to take a drive 

around the province. I went up to the north-west part of the 

province last Thursday and then across to Prince Albert and 

over to Nipawin on Friday and down the east side. 

 

Mr. Speaker, what the Minister of Health should do, what the 

Minister of Health and her sidekick from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow should do, is that they should maybe get in a car 

and take a drive around the province as I did last week. And 

they should get out on the main streets of our towns and our 

cities and talk to people about Bill 3; not fly over them in an 

airplane and drop in to selected settings for an hour or two but 

actually get out and walk up and down as I did last Friday 

morning in Prince Albert — just walking down main street 

stopping into stores where the people didn't know me and I 

didn't know them. But you know what, Mr. Speaker? Every 

person in this province is willing to talk about this Bill. They're 

willing to be very open about it. They have opinions about it. 

 

People in Prince Albert say the lid is going to come off in our 

community because this thing has been mismanaged so badly. 

People on Main Street, Saskatchewan are saying the lid is 

coming off because it has been mismanaged so badly. We are 

being asked to take a stroll in the fresh, tangy air of the open 

sea. Our communities, our infrastructure, our reason for being 

is asked to walk the plank. That's what they're saying, Mr. 

Speaker. That is where the debate is taking place. 

 

And logically, Mr. Speaker, as the elected representatives of 

those people, logically these members over here, those that fill 

the back rows over there should be taking part in this debate 

because they are representing or should be representing tens of 

thousands of Saskatchewan people who are being asked to take 

a stroll in the fresh, tangy air of the open 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1299 

sea. 

 

And what we see from them is compliance — compliance that 

their front benches would allow closure to be brought in, 

compliance that their front benches would ram a Bill through 

this legislature, Mr. Speaker, that fundamentally affects tens of 

thousands of people in communities all over our province. 

 

And it would be one thing, Mr. Speaker, if we were closing 

down a business, if we were bringing a Bill in this legislature to 

shut down 52 hockey rinks. What we are talking about here, 

Mr. Speaker, is 52 health care institutions and dozens of other 

ones as yet not pointed at by the Minister of Health. What we 

are talking about here is the inability of local control to have its 

day, to have its say, and to be responsible taxpayers. What I 

heard in my little swing around Saskatchewan last week, Mr. 

Speaker, is people saying, time and time again, that this 

government, this Minister of Health and this Premier, don't 

give us any credit for being strong, intelligent people. 

 

Mr. Speaker, in most of these rural communities what you are 

dealing with are the third and fourth generation of people that 

came to this country from somewhere else and carved a life out 

of the land for themselves. These are the direct descendants of 

people who came here with no services, without a roof over 

their head. Many of them dug a hole in the ground, Mr. 

Speaker, and covered it with sod and they lived in it because 

they knew that this was a land where you would build 

something. 

 

So these people in these communities, these communities that 

we stood and defended in this legislature today, these are not 

craven people, Mr. Speaker. They come from good stock. 

These are good, honest taxpayers. 

 

The hospital auxiliary in almost every rural community in this 

province has raised money, has put in innumerable hours, has 

volunteered, provided their services because they are 

responsible taxpayers. And they're saying this government 

doesn't give us the credit that we deserve. That if they simply 

would have allowed local people the time and the budget, we 

will do the rationalization and the modernization of our health 

care system that we all know responsible taxpayers must do. 

Work with us, give us direction, but do not impose your 

solutions. 

 

Mr. Speaker, this from a government who promised them so 

different a story such a short time ago, who always pandered to 

the health care issue. It didn't matter what was said. No, they 

were always against it. They'd always do more. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the feeling of betrayal to those people is stronger 

than I have ever felt it before. And the solutions are so simple. 

The solutions are simply a matter of listening and of working 

with people. 

 

Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I attended the signing ceremony which 

had the community of Central Butte — Central Butte Union 

Hospital, Central Butte manor, 

and Central Butte ambulance board — join the Moose 

Jaw-Thunder Creek Health Care District. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I think, was a positive 

experience. Not that any one stood up and said that there won't 

be problems; that they probably would have preferred to have 

more money. But it was positive, Mr. Speaker, because there 

isn't one person on that board who has been imposed by the 

Minister of Health. There isn't going to be one person on that 

board who that Minister of Health or her government will 

impose on that board. And that is different, Mr. Speaker, from 

my understanding what's going on anywhere else in the 

province. These people at least feel that their own destiny is in 

the hands of responsible, elected, local people. 

 

And you know what, Mr. Speaker? The reason that there is a 

positive feeling amongst those folks, that they can overcome 

some of the apprehension, is that they have been at this process 

since 1987. Six long years of redefining acute care service. Six 

long years of redefining what home care should look like. Six 

long years of looking at ambulance services. Six long years of 

understanding how union hospitals and privately funded 

institutions can cooperate. 

 

That is why, Mr. Speaker, there is some ability to cope with 

change. Every community in this province would only ask as 

much, Mr. Speaker — that it be entirely local people with 

enough financial wherewithal to define their own region and 

their own capabilities. Not the imposition from on high, as we 

have seen from this minister and this government. 

 

All the more reason, Mr. Speaker, that you should not have 

closure in this legislature. All the more reason, Mr. Speaker, 

that you shouldn't have hundreds of Saskatchewan citizens 

getting up in the middle of the night to come to the steps of 

their legislature to protest and ask for the ear of the people who 

are defining their future. All the more reason that those people 

should not be shoved out in the cold — given the cold 

shoulder, and not listened to, like we have seen this 

government not listen to them. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, you will find . . . And I would challenge 

anyone in this legislature: get in your car and drive around to 

the communities of this province and just simply listen to what 

they're saying. What they are saying, Mr. Speaker, is what the 

Star-Phoenix of April 21, '93, has on its editorial page. It says: 

 

 What a farce! The issue: . . . Our position: Stop blather about 

local control. 

 

(1615) 

 

Mr. Speaker, in a half hour's time you are going to have to call 

a vote on Bill 3. A half hour is all the democracy that is left to 

the people in the communities of this province who are having 

the Minister of Health define their future for them. That's all 

the democracy that's left for those people. 

 

This from the government opposite, the members 



1300 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

opposite, and from that political party who are on record in 

verbatim in this House for tens of hours against such an 

imposition of authoritarian control. 

 

There is nothing, Mr. Speaker, left for these people but shame. 

If any one of them who mouthed those words in this legislature 

such a short few years ago can have anything but shame today 

as the clock ticks down to the imposition of Bill 3, then they 

should have taken the opportunity sometime in the debate to 

stand up and deny their own words and deny the shame that 

must hang over the head of everyone who sits for the NDP 

Party in this legislature. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I'll take my seat because other of my caucus wish 

to comment on this pall of shame that hangs over this 

legislature. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too want to say a 

few things about what I believe is a very, very serious erosion 

on the people of Saskatchewan's ability to have health care 

delivered in a reasonable fashion. 

 

Mr. Speaker, today we had a day of mourning, April 28, to 

honour workers killed and injured on the job. Mr. Speaker, 

today is a sad day in the health care field for the people in my 

part of the province. 

 

I want to point out to this Assembly some of the things that I 

have learned from the people that are here that are supposed to 

provide to us the answers. And these are some of the 

observations that I've made. 

 

One, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that has been placed before 

us is first of all that the health care district that I am in and has 

been working hard to have a reasonable approach to the health 

care policy of this government, a wellness model, is the area of 

the Swift Current Union Hospital district. And that, Mr. 

Speaker, is facing a very, very serious concern. 

 

In fact, Mr. Speaker, the members of the steering committee 

resigned because of some very serious concerns as it relates to 

what this Health minister is doing to them. 

 

Mr. Speaker, in the Swift Current Union Hospital district, there 

are roughly 20,000 people; 20,000 people, Mr. Speaker, on the 

basis of a regional hospital have between two and a half to 

three beds per thousand. Which means, Mr. Deputy Speaker, 

that the people in that area who now have 78.6 beds per day on 

an average daily census, they will have in acute care a 

reduction of at least 18 beds or 28 beds, depending on which 

the minister will choose to take, whether it's two and a half in a 

thousand or three a thousand. 

 

But they will have to contend with, Mr. Deputy Speaker, a 

reduction of between eighteen and a half beds or twenty-eight 

and a half beds. And that, Mr. Speaker, is a concern to the 

people in Swift Current. 

On top of that, Mr. Speaker, the community that I represent and 

the constituency that I represent and the constituency that is 

comprised of a health care district that's called the Rolling 

Hills, which is surrounding the city of Swift Current, that 

health care district, Mr. Deputy Speaker, has 12,000 people in 

it stretching from the American border on the south to the 

South Saskatchewan River on the north — 130 miles long and 

at least 110 or 20 miles wide. 

 

That health care district, Mr. Speaker, that health care district 

has 12,000 people and should have 18 beds, acute care, spread 

through the various hospitals that are there — Mankota, 

Kincaid, Ponteix, Vanguard, Cabri, and Gull Lake. Every one 

of those hospitals should have an opportunity to provide acute 

care to the people in those communities. But do they, Mr. 

Speaker? No, the Minister of Health yesterday said that acute 

care beds will not be provided in those hospitals that I 

mentioned. There is only one hospital in that whole Rolling 

Hills district that has acute care facilities and will maintain 

acute care facilities and that is Herbert, at five and a half beds. 

Five and a half beds, Mr. Deputy Speaker, mean that in that 

district, mean that in that district it will be at a .39 beds per 

thousand. 

 

That is despicable, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and that is what these 

people are arguing about from one end of my constituency to 

the other. That is why the people of Vanguard shut down the 

town. The mayor declared a civic holiday so that the people 

could come to Regina here to talk to the Minister of Health, 

because that community will be devastated by the fact that the 

hospital is gone. And I asked her yesterday — the Minister of 

Health — yesterday I asked her would these people have an 

opportunity to maintain acute care beds and she said no. 

 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, they are 55 miles away from the nearest 

health facility — 55. That's an hour. You get an ambulance out, 

an ambulance in; it's two hours, Mr. Speaker, and that is very, 

very critical. And, Mr. Speaker, we have had two stories 

spoken about. One they say it in Regina; the other story they 

say it in Mankota; or the other story they tell the people in 

Vanguard. And that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is a fact. 

 

As a matter of fact they tell people in the rural parts of the 

province . . . in fact I had one of the people in the steering 

committee tell me this, Mr. Deputy Speaker, told me that they 

were closing down Lafleche, which is a fact, and that they were 

going to build Gravelbourg which is 13 miles away. For $10 

million they were going to build a new hospital there. 

 

And the people think that's grossly unfair. It's disgusting. And 

people will say to you in spades it is wrong — absolutely, 

totally wrong. And, Mr. Speaker, the people in the 

communities have worked hard. 

 

I want to just point out to the people of this Assembly a letter 

that the Minister of Health got, and I got a carbon copy of it 

myself, from the director of care at Cabri. And, Mr. Deputy 

Speaker, the director of care at Cabri is a very efficient, a very 

fine nurse. And I'll put it to 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1301 

you this way: she is of the old stock, she is British, and she 

comes from England and was trained in England, and 

understands efficiencies and health care to the last straw, Mr. 

Deputy Speaker. And this is what she had to say: 

 

 In order to cut costs, staff in Cabri do multiple jobs (Mr. 

Deputy Speaker). My nurse aides also do the laundry. This 

has been cost-effective. They do the laundry, they do the 

floors. 

 

Why, Mr. Deputy Speaker? So that the people in the province 

of Saskatchewan don't have to put money into that and the 

people themselves will maintain that infrastructure within that 

community. They are proud of that facility. They are proud of 

it in Herbert; they are proud of it in Gull Lake; they are proud 

of it in Vanguard. 

 

In fact, Mr. Speaker, the hospital in Vanguard last year 

received a brand-new X-ray machine. Where was wellness 

when they were putting money into that? And now they're 

going to sell them? What are they going to do with all the 

X-ray machines that they're going to take out of the six 

hospitals in my district? What are they going to do with them? 

What are they going to do with the six doctors that now won't 

have any jobs? Are they going to give them privileges in health 

care units that don't have an acute care bed in them? 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, they are very, very seriously concerned. 

And I agree with them, Mr. Speaker. And I agree with the 

article that appeared in the Star-Phoenix. What a farce. 

Absolutely, totally, a blather. That's what they talk about. They 

say global funding here. And what do they say when they get 

out of here? No, it's not going to be global funding. Do you 

have a local autonomy here? Yes, you do. Out in the country 

— no, you don't. 

 

All of these things are talked about in this Assembly but when 

you get out in the country and ask the people what their health 

boards have said and what they have told the health boards, 

they have absolutely no control of the agenda. 

 

And that, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is the reason why in the 

community of Swift Current the board resigned. I'll tell you 

another thing, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and that is this: the 

Minister of Health should understand that those people that 

were on that planning committee, that steering committee, were 

people who were in the Health Region No. 1 to begin with. 

They understood it. 

 

And if you ask Mr. Eugene Waker, who was 30 years as a 

reeve in the municipality of Swift Current, if you turned to him 

and said to him: sir, what do you think of this, he would say, I 

quit because it won't work because we don't have governance. 

We don't have the opportunity to develop a health care system 

in this community like we have done for years and years. 

 

Mr. Speaker, He was on that Health Region No. 1 board and he 

understood it. And now we have a 

whole new program, Mr. Speaker, and it is wrong. 

 

And therefore, Mr. Speaker — I'm going to give up my place 

so that other members of our caucus can talk about this — but 

I, Mr. Speaker, have adamantly opposed from the perspective, 

not of saving money, but I oppose it on the basis that it I don't 

believe anywhere will save the dollars that these people have 

projected. 

 

In fact if the minister was prepared to put her utilization 

commission report on the Table, we would all find out that this 

is strictly her own agenda about something to rip the rural 

communities in the province of Saskatchewan. And I will 

defend those rural communities till the last time that I ever 

have a chance to vote in this Assembly. 

 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It is a 

pleasure to rise yet again and to address this Bill No. 3, An Act 

respecting Health Districts. 

 

Mr. Speaker, over the last several weeks Saskatchewan, and 

especially rural Saskatchewan, became victims of the 

indifference of the members opposite. The government 

imposed drastic budgetary measures on people in rural areas, 

and is only now creating the health districts which we all 

thought were going to be empowered to make important 

decisions. 

 

Mr. Speaker, our health system needs to change. It needs to be 

changed to remove the tragedy as outlined by Ross Thatcher, 

and he stated that we do not get value for our health care dollar. 

The health system needs to be more reflective of the people's 

needs and wants. And we do need this system to be part of the 

1990s and taking us into the 21st century. 

 

Questions remain however, Mr. Speaker, and some questions 

more than others. Is this government, a government asking for 

passage of this Bill today, being fair to the people of rural 

Saskatchewan? Is it being fair to health care consumers? Is it 

being fair to the many men and women who labour long days 

in our hospitals and our care homes to maintain our health? 

Above all, Mr. Speaker, the question remains on whether this 

government has a sound vision for health care in 

Saskatchewan. 

 

Sadly, Mr. Speaker, while I realize that health care reform is 

necessary, I believe, as do many people of this province, that 

this government is not being fair to the health care-givers of 

this province, it is not being fair to those who require care, and 

it is not being fair to the already hard-pressed people of rural 

Saskatchewan. 

 

As well, Mr. Speaker, this government, just like the members 

of the official opposition when they were in power, does not 

appear to have a vision for health care. Although the 

government has rhetoric and is taking actions, its actions are 

helter-skelter. The government's plans are reckless, as reckless 

as the spending spree of the members of the previous 



1302 Saskatchewan Hansard April 28, 1993 

government. 

 

And why? Why could this government be accused of being that 

reckless? Because we're talking about a $1.5 billion 

expenditure item, Mr. Speaker. And it is being changed based 

on the concept of a model that has never been tried. It is just a 

concept — no kind of working out through a pilot project to 

determine whether or not this is going to save monies; no way 

of determining whether or not this is going to be more cost 

efficient; no tried-and-true way of determining whether or not 

this is going to harm people in the province or better serve the 

people of this province. 

 

(1630) 

 

Now I do know that today, Mr. Speaker, there was an 

announcement that in the North they were going to have one 

year in which to put together their health board. And I'm 

wondering what it is that is so distinctive about the North that 

makes it different from people who are in the south-west of our 

province where they too have vast differences to cover. I mean 

these are two very unique parts of Saskatchewan. And the 

people of our province have a right to be able to have pilot 

projects to determine whether or not this is going to work. 

 

Another thing announced today, Mr. Speaker, was about the 

Prince Albert area and that now, after the fact, there is some 

indication that perhaps we will have some form of pilot project. 

I don't know whether that's something we should simply accept 

after all of these different kinds of decisions have been made 

and the door is closed. Perhaps what we should have done was 

to empower people in the first place so that they could have 

been participants in the process, checking out over a period of 

time whether this was going to be in the best interests of health 

care in Saskatchewan. 

 

As you know, Mr. Speaker, full well from the members of the 

opposition and myself, we've received endless letters and 

many, many calls on this particular issue — numerous letters 

and calls from people who are very, very much concerned 

about what is happening not just to themselves personally, but 

to their communities, their health care system overall, and their 

loved ones who rely upon it. 

 

Most of these people don't believe that they're being treated 

fairly, that they're being honoured, that they're being respected, 

that they are seen as people who can participate in the process 

fully. They don't believe that their communities and that their 

families are being given the respect that they deserve. And they 

believe that they are not getting the treatment which they, as 

residents of the province of Saskatchewan, as taxpayers of the 

province of Saskatchewan, deserve because they are not getting 

the details they need of what the health plan involves. And they 

are not being included fully in the process to be able to try 

things out in their own areas. 

 

They don't mind the system being changed. They don't object 

to the system being changed. But they want some assurances 

that rural Saskatchewan will 

not turn into an outback where the only health services are 

helicopters taking people to distant health services. 

 

One of the many caring people in our province wrote to me and 

said, I quote, Mr. Minister: 

 

 For these 52 communities who are losing their hospitals and 

acute care facilities there is no hope. They are losing more 

than just a hospital, but their livelihoods. They have worked 

hard to make their communities grow and prosper, and now 

your government has come in and taken (all of) that away. 

 

This woman continued to say that rural people: 

 

 . . . feel that the "rug has been pulled out from under their 

feet" . . . 

 

And then appeals to the minister: 

 

 PLEASE listen to the district planning groups and hear what 

they have to say. They live and work in these communities 

. . . and know how things are done . . . PLEASE don't rush 

into this new health care program. These are lives we are 

talking about and I think a person's life is a lot more 

important than cutting $22 million from the provincial health 

care budget. 

 

Another resident from the rural area expressed similar 

concerns, Mr. Speaker, similar concerns that they are not 

getting respected, that they are not being listened to, that there 

is too much of a hurry, a concern that the government is not 

providing people with the details of the wellness model — if it 

can indeed call it a model. 

 

The woman attended the Eston meeting where some 1,600 

people, more than the entire community of Eston — as has 

been pointed out by the member from Kindersley — attended 

to show their concern to the Minister of Health. Mr. Speaker, 

this woman writes that she saw the Minister of Health at the 

meeting, and she quotes: 

 

 . . . I watched you. I listened to your speech. I watched you 

(Madam Minister) as the panel gave their presentations. I saw 

the indifference (that) you and your staff had to the plight of 

the people of Eston. 

 

And she continues, Mr. Speaker to say that she, and I quote: 

 

 I realized that (the minister) had (her) mind made up. The 

concerns and emotions shown (to) you by the people of Eston 

seemed to have no effect on you (Minister), although, at one 

point, (she) felt we were being impatiently chastized . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker, those are but two of the many, many people in 

this province who do not feel that they are being fairly treated 

by this government. They don't feel that the health plans 

embodied in these new 



April 28, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 1303 

health districts are the right ones. If they are, they just want 

time to chart their own way as an entire community. 

 

Over the last several weeks, this government hasn't been fair to 

the people of this province. It announced the introduction of 

this Bill, as it promised, but while they answered some 

questions, they created many others. Added to this were the 

announced budgetary decisions that funding for some 52 acute 

care hospitals would be ended as of October 1. After that, 

funding will be based on the ability of a district to reach 

selected bed targets. 

 

Now I'll give the minister credit, Mr. Speaker. If she wanted to 

come out with a flurry of decisions and announcements over a 

period of weeks, they were almost as successful as the official 

opposition were in giving away plums before the election — 

plums which I might add only contributed to the financial crisis 

which is forcing us, as a province, to deal with the financial 

crisis and cuts to things like health care and agriculture 

programs. 

 

Mr. Speaker, there has been a flurry of decisions and with it 

have come waves of worries. In the communities across this 

province, people want to know what will replace their acute 

care hospitals. People want to know what will the services be 

that these centres offer. They want to know what will happen to 

their seniors, their loved ones, who are in crisis. 

 

Just the other day in this House they couldn't explain to the 

people of Saskatchewan what will happen to people in 

long-term care that are now in hospitals that are to close. I 

know the minister is only cutting acute care funding, Mr. 

Speaker, but people are worried that under the new districts 

there will no longer be long-term facilities — no place for the 

elderly to go, no place for moms and dads and grandparents 

and so on, but to leave and go to another community without 

the kind of support from family. These people are worried. 

They are worried that they will be without care because the 

budgetary decisions that will amount to restrictions will affect 

the amount of care that they have already had. They're already 

made long before the local input, the community-based aspect 

of this system, like district boards, before they ever get a 

chance to make any decisions. 

 

The funding for these beds is gone before district boards can 

make a decision to allocate services based on their own needs 

assessments. It's gone before these very individuals could even 

decide whether keeping acute care beds might be the very best 

decision. All the important decisions, Mr. Speaker, were made 

before the real people even got to have their input. 

 

This begs a question. It begs a question of whether this is fair. 

Is it fair for the government to stifle debate in this House and 

then not provide answers outside of it to any of the people who 

really matter — the people who will pay for these decisions; 

the people who will be most affected by these decisions. 

And it is ironic, Mr. Speaker, that the government wants to 

create district boards under this Bill and is now asking that 

they, or the planning committees, to do the needs assessments. 

They asked them to do these assessments, but they go out and 

make the decisions of which hospitals will stay, which will go, 

before any of the local people, the local boards, that they are 

proposing here today, are ever even put in place. It's so 

ridiculous. 

 

It's completely out of order, Mr. Speaker. That is not fair. That 

is a sign of a minister that could have saved herself and the 

taxpayers gas money, because she went out to hear people like 

the woman I spoke of in Eston, but she didn't want to hear or 

feel what they were saying and feeling. 

 

Mr. Speaker, there are other aspects of this government's lack 

of fairness when it comes to health care. They close hospitals 

and set up districts without offering any plans about how 

inevitable job lay-offs will occur. When health care districts 

spend 70 to 80 per cent of all of their revenues on employment, 

there will be job losses. The government didn't provide people 

with a viable job creation and economic development plan for 

rural areas; didn't go in and talk about the people for how they 

could be participants in making this happen. She simply 

brought in her decision. 

 

The government has no plan in place to retrain health care 

workers, like many of the psych nurses who will lose their jobs 

and want a reason to stay in Weyburn. All of these things 

happening because of improper process by this government, 

Mr. Speaker. That is not fair to health care givers. It is not fair 

when there is no coherent strategy. It is definitely not fair when 

25 people out of 630, the total population of Ponteix, is told 

they will no longer have jobs, Mr. Speaker. That's like 7,200 

people being told in Saskatoon they will no longer have jobs. 

Surely there could have been an approach put in place to allow 

this community to make some of its own decisions within a 

district to be able to accommodate those people who are losing 

their jobs. 

 

What they are doing, Mr. Speaker, is putting part C of their 

plan, if they actually have one, before part A. 

 

Another example of the inconsistency of their plan is found 

when it comes to the drug plan. The government says that the 

districts they want in this Bill will save money, will guarantee 

services in their plan. At the same time however, as Dr. 

Sinclair of Regina noted, they're making the pharmaceutical 

aspect of health less accessible. They expect everyone to have a 

better health care system and get the care they need, thanks to 

these districts, but they go out and gut the drug plan. As Dr. 

Sinclair argues, the government has failed to realize that drugs 

are as much an important aspect of our health care today as 

they were 30 years ago. 

 

This government deinsures much of that sector and yet still 

expects us to believe that they somehow have a coherent plan 

for health reform just because they are

creating districts. They somehow have a coherent plan because 

they're creating districts, and they're in such a hurry to do so 

and are willing to do anything in order to get their way. That, 

Mr. Speaker, is not fair to the people of our province. It is not 

fair to health care recipients and to the taxpayers who must pay 

for this plan. 

 

So I ask again, Mr. Speaker, of the government, why are they 

in such a rush? There is no real reason to hurry this legislation 

through. People want more time to discuss how this will have 

an impact on their communities, their jobs, their loved ones, 

and themselves. They want more time, and the people of this 

province deserve it. If the government can have endless time to 

answer key questions, endless time to lay concerns to rest, then 

the people surely deserve the same. 

 

In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge the government to reconsider 

these Draconian ways, to reconsider its heavy-handedness, its 

cart before the horse planning. People need to know that they 

can be part of the process. They need to know because this is 

their health care system, and they need to know that they are 

the ones to have the most influence upon it. People need to 

know that they have representatives that are committed to their 

well-being and to the principles of consultation, community, 

and cooperation — the principles that helped to build the 

province of Saskatchewan. 

 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I realize 

that it won't be all that long before you are forced to call the 

vote in this Assembly. But I want to bring a few points to the 

floor, points that were raised at last night's meeting in 

Whitewood; I'm sure the points that have been raised all across 

the province regarding the health Bill before this Assembly and 

regarding the closure motion that has been presented by the 

government and by the Minister of Health. 

 

Mr. Speaker, one of the things that came through very loud and 

clear last night was the fact that the people of Whitewood and 

the surrounding region indeed wanted some more time. They 

wanted the ability to have the opportunity to voice their 

concerns, to raise their concerns, to discuss their ideas. And 

they had a lot of sound and positive proposals that they could 

have put forward that they wanted to put forward. 

 

In fact they raised them with the Minister of the Environment. 

And I trust the Minister of the Environment, as he represented 

the Minister of Health last night, was indeed listening very 

carefully, and that over the next period of time, even as this 

Bill is voted in and brought into . . . passed in this Assembly, 

that the government will indeed listen to the concerns that have 

been raised, will take heed to the suggestions that have been 

raised, and will offer the public a time, a period in which they 

can put forward their proposals and indeed bring health care 

services and maintain health care services in their communities 

and in the province of Saskatchewan.
