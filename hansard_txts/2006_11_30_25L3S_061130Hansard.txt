STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Eastview. 
 

World AIDS Day 
 
Ms. Junor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Tomorrow activist 
groups all over the world will rally in support of a common 
cause. Since 1988, December 1 has been recognized as World 
AIDS [acquired immune deficiency syndrome] Day. Mr. 
Speaker, although fundraising is an important aspect of AIDS 
day, it is also about increasing awareness, fighting prejudice, 
and improving education. Friday will be important in reminding 
us all that HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] is not a 
disease of the past and that there’s still much to be done. 
 
Mr. Speaker, for the past two years the World AIDS Campaign 
has organized World AIDS Day activities across the globe. The 
slogan for their work is, “Stop AIDS. Keep the Promise” — an 
appeal to governments and regional health authorities to comply 
with initiatives that target HIV. 
 
Mr. Speaker, AIDS has killed more than 25 million people, 
making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded 
history. The lives of an estimated 3.1 million people were 
claimed in 2005 alone, more than 500,000 of whom were 

children. According to UN [United Nations] AIDS estimates, 
Mr. Speaker, there are now 39.5 million people living with 
HIV, including 2.3 million children. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’ve been to Africa — one of the most affected 
regions in the world — and seen first-hand the horrors of this 
disease. Though the vast majority of those affected live in 
developing nations, HIV today is a threat to men, women, and 
children on all continents around the world. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’d like to encourage all members to support the 
fight against AIDS by wearing a red ribbon. Because of the 
work of dedicated groups like the WAC [World AIDS 
Campaign], a world free from AIDS epidemic may sometime 
be a reality. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

Archerwill Athlete Wins Bob Adams Award 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
It gives me great pleasure today to rise and recognize a young 
lady from my constituency, Chelsey Revoy of Archerwill, who 
was awarded the esteemed Bob Adams Award as the top female 
Saskatchewan track and field athlete for 2006. 
 
Chelsey was honoured with this prestigious award in 
recognition of a year of outstanding performances which were 
showcased in gold medals in junior girls’ shot put and discus 
and a bronze medal in javelin at high school provincials. This 
was followed by gold medals in shot put, javelin, and silver 
medals in discus and hammer at the Juvenile Dual Meet. 
 
She earned gold medals in discus, javelin, and hammer and a 
silver medal in shot put at the Saskatchewan Athletics 
championship in Regina. And Chelsey topped these superior 
performances with a gold in shot put in the Canadian National 
Juvenile Championships in Burnaby, BC [British Columbia] 
this summer where she threw her personal best or 12.53 metres. 
This throw was only 1 centimetre short of breaking a provincial 
record. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’m sure that we’ll all be hearing a lot more about 
this young lady’s achievements as she is already in training for 
the upcoming indoor session, and she plans to attend her first 
meet in December.

First Recipient of Aboriginal Business Education Award 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words 
about an extraordinary woman who grew up in my constituency 
of Cumberland in the community of Cumberland House. 



626 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

Monica Goulet is a Métis woman whose education and 
experience have made her an outstanding advocate of human 
rights and an exceptional role model for First Nations and Métis 
youth. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Monica was once a high school dropout. Today 
she has multiple degrees including a Bachelor of Education 
from SUNTEP [Saskatchewan urban native teacher education 
program], a Bachelor of Arts with distinction in English. She is 
a published author and most recently an M.B.A. [Master of 
Business Administration] candidate at the University of 
Saskatchewan. This mother of two is an inspiring example of 
living your dream. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Monica has been named as the first ever recipient 
of the Scotiabank Aboriginal Business Education Award, a 
$10,000 scholarship awarded annually to an Aboriginal student 
in a Master of Business Administration program at the U of S 
[University of Saskatchewan]. I would ask all members to help 
me congratulate Monica Goulet on all her achievements. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker.

Balgonie to Host Tournament of Hearts 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last night there 
were many receptions held around the city of Regina and other 
communities. Last night I had the opportunity to go out to 
Balgonie and attend the media kickoff of the 2007 Scottie 
SaskPower ladies’ provincial curling championships, better 
known as the Tournament of Hearts. This championship will be 
held in Balgonie on January 31 to February 4, ’07. 
 
Balgonie has hosted this Tournament of Hearts before in the 
year 2002-2003 with great success. Many of the competitors 
thought it was one of the better provincials they had ever 
attended. And part of the reason for that is the facilities that 
Balgonie has. They have a really a top-notch rink, a brand new 
rink where every seat is a good seat when it comes to a 
Tournament of Hearts championship. And immediately beside 
the rink of course is a multiplex which serves for banquets and 
also for a lounge if you need to stop in between games and have 
a refresher. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the heads of the organizing committee, made up of 
Wayne Kiel and Ken Bakken, along with all the volunteers and 
directors I know will put on an absolutely great weekend. 
Balgonie is becoming well-known for its curling prowess, 
whether it’s hosting provincials like it has or of course last year 
with the Mandy Selzer rink ending up winning the provincials, 
the nationals, and second in the world. 
 
So Balgonie is certainly being put on the map for curling, and I 
would like to welcome everybody to Balgonie for January 31 to 
February 4 for the Scott Tournament of Hearts.

Saskatoon Public School Board Wins Premier’s Award 
 

Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Since 1999 the 
Premier’s Innovation and Excellence Award has been 
recognizing educational achievements and improvements that 
focus on student achievements and have been advanced or 
directed by boards of education. The broad purpose is to 
recognize and celebrate board of education involvement in the 
improvement of learning opportunities for Saskatchewan 
children and youth. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Premier’s office supports this award in 
recognition of this important role boards of education play in 
the development and improvement of publicly funded education 
here in the province. The Xerox company provides the $3,000 
prize to the Saskatchewan winner of this award, and it’s 
administered by the Saskatchewan School Boards Association. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to share with the Assembly today that 
the 2006 winner of this prestigious award is the Saskatoon 
Public School Division for their Literacy for Life program. 
Literacy for Life is a multi-year initiative to improve students’ 
reading skills with the goal of having all students, K to 12 
[kindergarten to grade 12], reading at or above grade level, and 
the $3,000 award will be used to support or extend this project. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to acknowledge Xerox company’s 
commitment to education through their sponsorship of this 
initiative, and I ask all members to join me in congratulating the 
Saskatoon Public School Division on receiving the 2006 
Premier’s Board of Education Award for Innovation and 
Excellence in Education. Thank you.

Families Need Friendly Government 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As I read the 
reports this morning of the Premier’s fundraiser dinner in 
Saskatoon I was struck by the fact that $200 a plate was a high 
price to pay for an admission of failure. After five years in 
office, the Premier has come up with a new, single focus in the 
dying months of his government, making Saskatchewan the 
most family friendly province in Canada. Mr. Speaker, a 
laudable goal. However this government’s deathbed conversion 
seems a little too late and a little insincere. 
 
I wonder when this NDP government is going to start being 
family friendly to the family of Terry Rak, who is paying for his 
own cancer drug. I wonder when this NDP government is going 
to start being friendly to the family of Doug Bonderud, who 
needlessly died of cancer. I wonder when this NDP government 
is going to start being friendly to the families suffering from a 
drought in my constituency and the other constituencies of the 
Southwest. 
 
And there are other families looking for friendship, Mr. 
Speaker. Yesterday we heard that while the food bank use was 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 627 

dropping in Canada, Saskatchewan posted the second highest 
increase in the nation. The NDP government has produced the 
second highest percentage of children who are food bank 
clients. The NDP also distinguished itself by producing the 
nation’s highest number of clients whose primary source of 
income is social assistance. This is a shameful record, Mr. 
Speaker.

2006 Saskatchewan Book Awards Winner 
 
Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the 
writing of On the Side of the People: a History of Labour in 
Saskatchewan involved four years of dedication and hard work 
from Jim Warren and Kathleen Carlisle. Their efforts were 
recently rewarded at the 2006 Saskatchewan Book Awards as 
the book won both in publishing in education and scholarly 
writing categories. 
 
This well-researched publication details the events and 
personalities that have shaped the thoughts of working people in 
Saskatchewan and the province that those workers built. 
Beginning with the year 1777, Mr. Speaker, On the Side of the 
People describes the first story of worker organization in 
Saskatchewan. Fur traders of the Hudson’s Bay Company 
banded together in a strike to protect their rights and improve 
living conditions. The book continues its account of the labour 
movement in Saskatchewan and describes the many struggles 
that Saskatchewan workers have overcome — the arrival of the 
railroad brotherhoods, the emergence of craft unions, two world 
wars, modernization, and the dawn of the present age, just to 
name a few. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I believe Jim Warren puts it best when he says, 
quote: “The struggles of Saskatchewan workers to improve 
their lot and develop . . . [their] province is truly a magnificent 
journey.” This journey continues today, Mr. Speaker, and 
there’s still much to be done. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in congratulating Jim 
Warren and Kathleen Carlisle on receiving two prestigious 
honours at the 2006 Saskatchewan Book Awards. Thank you.

Asset Management Contract Awarded 
by Investment Saskatchewan 

 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Janet 
Wightman is the CEO [chief executive officer] of Investment 
Saskatchewan. In addition she is now the CEO and major 
shareholder in Victoria Park Capital. Can the Minister for 

Investment Saskatchewan please outline the process that was 
used to award the contract for the management of Investment 
Saskatchewan assets to Victoria Park Capital? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, this contract was awarded to 
Victoria Park Capital by the board of Investment Saskatchewan, 
which is an arm’s-length quasi private sector board created by 
government to manage Crown assets. And, Mr. Speaker, when 
this organization was created, the government said that it was 
going to have non-political running of the investments of the 
Crown, the non-core investments by Investment Saskatchewan. 
 
And if the opposition does not believe that this board should be 
independent and should make those decisions, I invite the 
opposition to say so. But the position of the government, Mr. 
Speaker, is that this is an independent decision made by an 
independent board. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, the minister obviously failed 
to explain anything about the process that was used in choosing 
Victoria Park Capital. But last year Janet Wightman was the 
highest paid civil servant in Saskatchewan, and she earned just 
over $300,000. The management of some Investment 
Saskatchewan’s assets have now been privatized and is in the 
hands of Victoria Park Capital. Since she’s also the CEO and 
major shareholder in Victoria Park Capital, will she still be 
receiving her salary from Investment Saskatchewan? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, if it is a complaint of the 
member opposite as she just said that Ms. Wightman is the 
highest paid civil servant, the member from the opposition 
should be very happy because the answer, Mr. Speaker, is that, 
no, Ms. Wightman will no longer be receiving any pay from 
Investment Saskatchewan or the Government of Saskatchewan 
because she works for Victoria Park Capital which is a private 
company that has been set up and is majority employee-owned, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
And I repeat again that the Premier set out a vision of private 
sector management of the government’s investment assets. We 
have pursued that vision and put these decisions in the hands of 
the board of Investment Saskatchewan. And if the member 
opposite and her party disagree with that position, Mr. Speaker, 
I invite them to say so. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, to return a bit or for a moment 
about the process, what involvement did Janet Wightman have 



628 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

in the discussion to allow herself to take over the assets of 
Investment Saskatchewan? Is there not a conflict of interest if 
she, with Investment Saskatchewan, made the decision of 
awarding the assets to Victoria Park Capital? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, it has been the practice of the 
party opposite to play fast and loose with the facts and to use 
the immunity they have in the Legislative Assembly to cast 
aspersions on public servants and people in this province which, 
Mr. Speaker, they then cannot repeat out the Chamber where 
they do not have immunity. And I say to that member opposite 
that if she is alleging that there’s a conflict of interest on the 
part of Ms. Wightman, she should say so outside of this 
Chamber and be prepared to defend that in a court of law, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The decision to set up Victoria Park Capital, Mr. Speaker, was a 
decision of the board of Investment Saskatchewan, not Ms. 
Wightman. Ms. Wightman was an employee of the board, Mr. 
Speaker. And if that member has any evidence to the contrary, 
she should go outside this Chamber and do so, but she will not 
do so, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes . . . Order. The Chair 
recognizes the member for Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, the minister’s grandstanding is 
utterly ridiculous and I . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order. Order please. The Chair 
recognizes the member for Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The minister’s 
political grandstanding are utterly ridiculous. We have no issue 
going and saying was there a conflict of interest or not. We’re 
not making an accusation; we’re asking a question. Was there a 
conflict? Was she involved in the process? Since he wouldn’t 
tell us what the process was . . . 
 
[10:45] 
 
The Speaker: — Order. The member for Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Since the minister 
wouldn’t tell us exactly what the process was, we were asking a 
question. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what other companies were considered as possible 
candidates to manage the assets of Investment Saskatchewan, 
and why was Ms. Wightman’s company selected over all the 
other applicants? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Industry 
and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, now we see some 
backpedalling from the member. I will say this to the House, 
Mr. Speaker. I answered the question, Mr. Speaker, by advising 

the House that the decision was made by the board of 
Investment Saskatchewan, not by Ms. Wightman. 
 
I said, Mr. Speaker, that I invited the member, if she had any 
allegations of conflict of interest or evidence, to say so outside 
the House. And I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker, whatever I say 
inside this House will be what I say outside this House. I don’t 
think that applies to the member . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. The Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, a decision was made by the 
board of Investment Saskatchewan which is an independent 
board. I have invited the members opposite to say whether they 
believe in that process or whether they don’t. And if they don’t, 
they can say so, Mr. Speaker, but I will say this. The opposition, 
Mr. Speaker, has a habit of trashing the reputation of good 
Saskatchewan people in this House, and, Mr. Speaker, we will 
not tolerate that any longer.

Province’s Ranking in National Wait Times Assessment 
 

Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday the 
Wait Time Alliance released its interim report card on 
achieving wait time benchmarks and implementing wait time 
commitments. The Wait Time Alliance is made up of several 
national medical societies, including the Canadian Medical 
Association and the Canadian Association of Radiologists. 
 
The report grades provincial performance in five priority areas 
outlined in the 2004 first ministers’ ten-year plan to strengthen 
health care. They are diagnostic imaging, joint replacement, 
cancer care, sight restoration, and cataract care. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in four of those areas, the NDP’s performance is 
more than disappointing. Mr. Speaker, for joint replacement the 
NDP government received an F, meaning that more than 50 per 
cent of the population is not being treated within the benchmark 
set out in the 2004 report. Can the minister explain why 
Saskatchewan is last in that area? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And 
indeed we welcome the Wait Time Alliance’s report, as we will 
other reports, as they monitor progress that’s being made on the 
first ministers’ commitments. 
 
Mr. Speaker, members of this House will know that the 
commitments, the benchmarks were set in December 2005. 
And, Mr. Speaker, each of the provinces has until 2007 to build 
a strategy and a response to the agreements that were reached 
less than one year ago. The Wait Time Alliance, Mr. Speaker, 
has made it very clear in their about nine-month report that they 
— and I quote the WTA [Wait Time Alliance] Co-Chair Dr. 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 629 

Lorne Bellan, “‘Today, I think it’s fair to say that government 
efforts on wait times are showing promise.’” 
 
Mr. Speaker, indeed while we welcome the initial responses, we 
know that we’re all making significant progress, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In two of the five 
priority areas, diagnostic imaging and cancer care, this NDP 
government received a mark of incomplete. We know the NDP 
government has still failed to provide public access to wait 
times for cancer care on its Saskatchewan Surgical Care 
Network. People in Saskatchewan diagnosed with cancer still 
have no clue as to how long they’ll have to wait when it looks 
at their Surgical Care Network. We know from patients, we’ve 
heard from many, many patients that it takes up to three months 
for their first visit to an oncologist — that’s three times the 
national average. 
 
Can the minister explain why his NDP government has received 
marks of incomplete for two priority areas that we hear from 
people in Saskatchewan every day? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And 
as I’ve explained previously, as we’re dealing with reports 
comparing one level of government to another that the data 
collection processes used in this period of time, Mr. Speaker, 
are all over the map. In fact the Wait Time Alliance interim 
report card indicates under limitations there are wide variations 
in the manner by which government reports wait time data, 
including timeliness of data measurement standards and use of 
indicators and benchmarks. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Wait Time Alliance at this point is indicating 
very clearly that the way in which they’re comparing data is not 
the same from province to province, Mr. Speaker. So the data 
collected simply is an indication of where they think the 
provinces are and where they’re going. 
 
That having been said, Mr. Speaker, the province of 
Saskatchewan has made wait time reduction one of our 
significant priorities. And we’ve . . . 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. The Chair 
recognizes the member for Indian Head-Milestone. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Mr. McMorris: — It’s amazing, Mr. Speaker, it doesn’t seem 
to matter which report comes forward; it’s always incomplete or 
incorrect data by that organization. It doesn’t matter whether 
it’s SUN [Saskatchewan Union of Nurses]. It doesn’t matter 
whether it’s a Wait Time Alliance. It doesn’t matter whether it’s 
the Health Quality Council of Saskatchewan. Everyone is 
failing because they don’t have the correct data. 
 
But the point being is everyone is saying the same thing — that 
we have some of the longest waits in Saskatchewan, and it’s 
absolutely unacceptable. This alliance is made up of health care 
professionals from around Canada, and it’s judging all 
provinces the same. And unfortunately we get an F when it 
comes to joint replacement. We get a D when it’s sight 
restoration or cataract surgery. Mr. Speaker, when will the 
minister live up to what all these reports are saying and start 
dealing with the real issue — the longest waits in Canada? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 
member opposite is willing to look at the negative and not the 
positive. He neglects to indicate that the Wait Time Alliance 
points out very clearly, we get an A in cardiac care, Mr. 
Speaker, an A. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — That having been said, Mr. Speaker, I 
think we’ve got to stick to the facts in the province. On average 
there’s 257 surgeries performed every single day in this 
province, Mr. Speaker. We have targeted almost $9 million in 
this current budget, that they voted against across the way, to 
continue to reduce the wait times on surgery in this province, 
Mr. Speaker, specifically targeting the long waiting lists. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, we have reduced hips and knees, where we 
have amongst the longest waiting lists in the country, we’ve 
reduced hips and knee surgery in this province because of this 
method, Mr. Speaker, and these resources by 23 per cent.

Impact of Health Professionals Shortage on 
Rural Health Facilities 

 
Mr. Allchurch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Roughly one 
month ago emergency room services and patient admissions at 
the Spiritwood Hospital were indefinitely suspended. This was 
due to a lack of doctors. On November 3 in North Battleford the 
minister assured me that the issue in Spiritwood has been 
resolved. What did the member mean by this? 
 
Mr. Speaker, can the Minister of Health tell us or tell the 
Assembly whether or not he has resolved this problem? And 
how much longer will the people in Spiritwood have to wait? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 



630 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 
member opposite has an interesting memory, and we won’t 
question that in the Chamber today, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The matter in Spiritwood is being reviewed by a considerable 
number of people who are very close to the circumstances in 
that area, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The member knows that just two weeks ago there was a 
community meeting in the town of Shell Lake, Mr. Speaker, 
with representatives from Prince Albert, Big River, Shell Lake, 
Shellbrook, and Spiritwood, Mr. Speaker. In the last three days, 
Mr. Speaker, physicians from all of the sites in that area have 
been meeting to discuss how collectively they can provide 
assistance while the regional health authority is doing 
recruiting. Mr. Speaker, there are many efforts by many very 
good people involved in solving this problem, Mr. Speaker, and 
they are continuing. 
 
The Speaker: — Member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, two 
weeks ago I rose in this Assembly to ask the Minister of Health 
questions about the temporary closure of health centres in 
Bengough and Coronach. Mr. Speaker, according to the 
November 1 edition of the Regina Leader-Post, and I quote, 
“The suspension of . . . [health] services in rural Saskatchewan 
is a fact of life, Health Minister Len Taylor said . . .” 

 
Mr. Speaker, I think the minister hit the nail right on the head 
with that comment. It is becoming a fact of life under this NDP 
government. Mr. Speaker, the emergency services in Bengough 
and Coronach will once again be closed over the coming 
weekend. This is the second time in a span of two weeks. Can 
the minister tell this Assembly what is being done to rectify this 
ongoing problem? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 
member opposite puts quotation marks around the writer’s 
comments in that story in the Leader-Post and certainly not a 
direct quote from me. He quotes the writer of the story, Mr. 
Speaker. Again we cannot misrepresent statements that 
individuals make. That . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order. The Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
think the member opposite has heard me on many occasions in 
this Chamber talk about the valuable work that the regional 
health authorities and the medical associations and others, 
including those in Saskatchewan’s recruitment agency, Mr. 
Speaker, are doing to try to help to relieve the physician and 
nurse shortages in this province, Mr. Speaker. There are many 
incentive programs in place. There are many efforts being 

made. There are dollars targeted to . . . 
 
The Speaker: — The member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, these 
health centres will not be offering emergency services from 
Friday until Monday. On-again, off-again emergency services is 
a public safety risk. These services are supposed to be available 
24-7. 
 
It looks like the doctors’ shortage in rural Saskatchewan is so 
severe that we are now facing a shortage of locums to fill in for 
doctors when they are not able to work. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Coronach is home to a SaskPower power plant 
that produces a quarter of all electricity in the province, and it’s 
also home to the Poplar River coal mine. As the members are 
aware, these lines of work can be dangerous, and the potential 
for a serious emergency is very real. Mr. Speaker, what kind of 
disaster will it take for this minister and this government to take 
action? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
have provided information in this Chamber, to the media, and to 
the public through a number of different means, Mr. Speaker. I 
have provided information about the increase in physicians 
practising in the province of Saskatchewan over the last couple 
of years. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there remain communities and locations within 
this province, Mr. Speaker, where from time to time because of 
. . . for various reasons, there are temporary closures as a result 
of physicians who have either been in car accidents or broke 
their wrists or had family emergencies. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have been doing a very good job in a 
competitive marketplace in attracting physicians and nurses to 
this province, Mr. Speaker. We have targeted resources to 
ensure that we’re going to be able to do an even better job, Mr. 
Speaker. We are committed to that process, Mr. Speaker, and 
we will . . .

Crop Insurance 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
farmers and ranchers right across Saskatchewan are concerned 
with the crop insurance program. Yesterday was just another 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 631 

example when the farmers and ranchers from the Southwest had 
to come into their legislature to bring the issue to the minister 
and really got no satisfaction. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the minister also feels that his responsibility to 
farmers and the crop insurance program is to do two things: 
lower the coverage and raise the premiums. And that’s all we 
saw from this minister and that government over the last 
number of years. 
 
Will the minister commit today to do something constructive 
and help farmers and ranchers of Saskatchewan and fix the crop 
insurance program? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Agriculture and Food. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
the drought committee that was up yesterday did have a 
meeting with me previously. I met with them again yesterday 
after the session, and I explained to them some of the things that 
we were doing in crop insurance that would help make a 
difference. And indeed working with the farm support review 
committee, with the Crop Insurance Corporation through the 
department, we have some good, innovative plans to help make 
a program that really will work and will expand the service and 
coverage that crop insurance is able to do. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[11:00] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, this government’s been in power for 15 years, and all 
we’ve saw is the gutting of programs to help farmers and 
ranchers in this province. And I don’t think they believe for a 
minute there’s going to be many changes this year. 
 
Mr. Speaker, they’re asking to improve the crop insurance 
program so that when a disaster of any kind happens out there, 
it helps them get from the spring to the fall and have an 
adequate income to get to the next year. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in the Economy Committee the other day, the 
minister even agreed that the program isn’t working. And he 
says, and I quote, “And so there are situations where the 
program doesn’t apply and doesn’t work.” He goes on to say, 
“That’s a fact.” Another quote from the minister is, “There is a 
yield loss program available for forage but nobody buys it.” 
Well nobody buys it because it doesn’t work, Mr. Speaker. 
 
They have farmers and ranchers in a position where they have a 
program that doesn’t work, and yet they’re forced to buy it to 
get into the spring cash advance and operating loans. Will the 
minister finally make some constructive changes to that 
program? 
 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Agriculture and Food. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
of course the program is in place. Farmers are buying the 
program. Is it as effective as it could be? No, Mr. Speaker, and 
that’s why we’re working on making changes. 
 
Part of it, as we explained to the members in estimates, is that 
the technologies that are available today do not allow for 
measurements in that forage area. But we are developing and 
working at technologies that will give us the ability to do that. 
When those are in place, Mr. Speaker, then we will have the 
opportunity to build even better programs. 
 
But I want to say clearly that the crop insurance program and 
the programs that have been used over 15 years, Mr. Speaker, to 
help support farmers, have been effective. We have faced some 
incredible difficulties with BSE [bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy], with drought, with huge frost, Mr. Speaker, 
and we have put billions of dollars — billions of dollars — into 
the agricultural economy, Mr. Speaker. And this government, 
this NDP government, will continue to support the farmers of 
Saskatchewan. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Melville-Saltcoats. 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Well, Mr. Speaker, that minister says that 
that government stands behind farmers. I don’t believe he could 
find one farmer in this province that says crop insurance is 
working for them today. 
 
We’ve saw for 15 years since they cancelled the GRIP [gross 
revenue insurance program] program, they’ve downloaded on 
to everybody out there — municipalities — all over this 
province which costs farmers money. But at the same time 
they’ve gutted crop insurance and other programs that might 
actually sustain farmers in the time of need. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Doug Davidson yesterday made some comments 
— one of the members of the Southwest group that were in here 
and I quote, “‘The last two years have been extreme drought — 
very extreme.’” He goes on to say: 
 

. . . the Ponteix-area rancher said the severity of this 
drought and the deterioration of Saskatchewan Crop 
Insurance means “we can’t even obtain [any] coverage.” 
 
“The crop insurance program has been gutted,” . . . 
 

That’s what farmers think of that program. That’s what farmers 
think of that government. And they can’t wait forever for 
changes. They need them now for next spring’s contracts, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 



632 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

Agriculture and Food. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
I think the member opposite better widen his circle of people 
that he consults with because, Mr. Speaker, there are people, 
farmers across this province, who have received tremendous 
benefit from the crop insurance program. 
 
There are farmers who have engaged with us in terms of 
building better programs. Mr. Speaker, we’re engaged in doing 
that. Why, Mr. Speaker? Because this joint federal-provincial 
program, crop insurance, provides a good solid support but it 
does so in conjunction with other programs, Mr. Speaker, 
programs which will provide significant cash advances to help 
farmers through difficult periods. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there is difficulty where there is drought. There is 
difficulty where there is flood. But the programs that we are 
developing do meet those needs. How much, Mr. Speaker? Mr. 
Speaker, we are doing three times more per capita than any 
other province, than any other government in this country, Mr. 
Speaker. We are meeting the needs. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Why is the member for . . . 
Order please. Why is the member for Saskatoon Greystone on 
his feet? 
 
Mr. Prebble: — With leave to introduce guests, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The member for Saskatoon Greystone has 
requested leave for introductions. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. The member for 
Saskatoon Greystone. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Mr. Prebble: — Mr. Speaker, it’s my great pleasure to 
introduce 25 students, grade 7 students from Greystone Heights 
Elementary School who have joined us in the west gallery. And 
with those students is Michelle Pantel, their teacher. And 
they’re also joined by three chaperons: Mrs. Gomis, Mrs. Sidhu, 
and Mr. Giesbrecht. 
 
And I want to say how pleased I am to have these young people 
in the gallery. Greystone Heights Elementary School has made 
it a real point of visiting this legislature on a regular basis, and 
I’m looking forward to meeting with them later this morning. 
And I’d like to ask all members to join me in welcoming this 
group of students and their teacher and chaperones here this 
morning. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

INTRODUCTION OF BILLS

Youth and Recreation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 40, The 
Status of the Artist Amendment Act, 2006 be now introduced 
and read for the first time. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of Culture,

Deputy Clerk: — First reading of this Bill. 
 
The Speaker: — When will this Bill be read a second time? 
The Chair recognizes the Minister of Culture, Youth and 
Recreation. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, I’m referring this Bill to the 
Human Services Committee. The Act will require artists and 
engagers to enter into written contracts with specific elements. 
It also provides new definitions for the terms artist and engager, 
and I am also asking the committee to recommend the best way 
for collective bargaining to be put in place for professional 
Saskatchewan artists. 
 
And therefore, Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 40, The Status 
of the Artist Amendment Act, 2006 be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Human Services. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of Culture, 
Youth and Recreation that Bill No. 40, The Status of the Artist 
Amendment Act, 2006 be referred to the Standing Committee 
on Human Services. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt 
the motion?

SEVENTY-FIVE MINUTE DEBATE 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Rosemont. 
 

Recognition of the Government’s Commitment 
to Young People 

 
Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
apologize for the delay. I couldn’t hear over the other 
conversations going on in here. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the history of Saskatchewan has been a history of 
decades of social progress that have only been interrupted from 
time to time either in periods of economic downturn or by poor 
financial management by very few governments of the day. 
And I’d have to say that our Premier couldn’t be more right 
when he says that you cannot achieve social progress without 
economic progress. 
 
But he also says that if you do have economic progress, it’s 
incumbent on you to ensure that there’s social progress. And 
this, Mr. Speaker, is where we sometimes deviate from the 
members of other political parties who do not tie the linkage 
directly between economic and social progress. 
 
And today with the very strong economy that we have in 
Saskatchewan we’ve turned our attention to seeing what really 
are the things that over the years we had to hold the line on or 
cut back, and where are the opportunities now for those new 
investments in social progress that will continue to build on the 
legacy of innovative social change in Saskatchewan. And 
certainly we’ve seen — ever since ’95 actually when we got the 
budget into a positive situation — the progress has been steady, 
but we are in a position now to move more quickly on a number 
of things that ourselves and the people in the bureaucracy have 
wanted to do for a very long time. 
 
And one of those things of course is to continue to make 
Saskatchewan the best place for young people to live and work 
and build strong futures. And they actually have a double 
opportunity now, Mr. Speaker, because not only is the economy 
very good, but there’s a lot of us, myself included, who will be 
retiring within the near horizon. And certainly quality work 
opportunities are an important part of moving into that strong 
future. 
 
As well, we want to ensure that Saskatchewan families benefit 
from the strong economy, and I’ll provide more detail, Mr. 
Speaker, as I move through my remarks on the specific things 
that are being done. 
 
And as well, we believe that although our province is very 
down-to-earth, only the sky is our limit. We have a history of 
people who dream big and innovate. I think we have the largest 
numbers of patents per population of anywhere, perhaps in the 
world — very innovative people here in Saskatchewan.  
 

And today we’ve seen with the status of the artist legislation, 
the continuing innovation that takes place, as well as the 
progressive people who understood the need for people who 
dedicate themselves to making our lives more enjoyable to 
share in the benefits of that work that they do. 
 
I don’t know if you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, but some of 
the first instruments ever found were found in caves, and they 
were drums made of skin and flutes made of bone. And what 
interests me about that is that even when people lived in very 
primitive conditions with survival very much on their minds, 
they still took the time for arts and culture. They still did their 
cave paintings. They made music. And the spirit has always 
been a very strong part of survival in the human life. 
 
In the province today we do have a labour shortage. And one of 
the reasons we have a labour shortage is because of the very 
competitive nature of Saskatchewan today for youth who wish 
to pursue an entrepreneurial direction, who wish to be involved 
in business and Crowns and those type of employment 
opportunities. 
 
We had a recent study done by KPMG about the alternatives of 
doing business in the 128 cities and 9 countries. And it included 
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, 
Japan, Singapore, the United States, and Canada. And, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, four cities stood out as having a very good 
standing for places to come and establish your business or if 
you’re here, to decide to take that idea you’ve had, that dream 
you’ve had, and establish your own business. And those places, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, are Saskatoon, Regina, Prince Albert, 
and Moose Jaw. 
 
And of course Moose Jaw being probably one of the most 
interesting stories because when people thought that they really 
didn’t have an opportunity to have that economy grow, they 
decided that they were going to take matters into their own 
hands, and they built a spa and discovered their heritage of 
underground tunnels and have built a very interesting tourism 
economy based on the very natural assets that they had in that 
community. 
 
[11:15] 
 
And many communities around Saskatchewan are doing that 
today. They’re taking their natural assets, the good investment 
climate, finding partners, and making things happen. And 
certainly we’ve seen the growth taking place in Saskatoon, and 
we have seen a trend for people to move from the rural areas 
into the urban areas. And sometimes when people make that 
move, if they’re moving to a urban centre, they will sometimes 
bypass the urban centres in Saskatchewan. But I think, Mr. 
Speaker, we’ll see that changing. 
 
I read an article recently that talked about the co-op 
employment centre at the university. And it used to be that quite 
a few of their students would look for employment 
opportunities outside the province. Well today over 90 per cent 
of the students that go into the co-op centre are indicating that 
they want a placement in Saskatchewan and this is where they 
want to be and this is where they want to stay. So this a very 
good place to work and to go to school and to do business, Mr. 
Speaker. 



634 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

One of the things that makes students decide to do that is the 
people who work in the co-op centre are very positive about 
Saskatchewan. They talk to the students about opportunity. 
They talk to them about benefit. They talk to them about the 
very good companies that they’ll be working for or perhaps it 
might be a government department. 
 
And it certainly contrasts with the steady stream of negativity 
from the party opposite. I have here several pages of quotes that 
represent virtually half the members over there, and it’s just 
negative, negative, negative. And certainly if they’re interested 
in seeing how their comments appear to others, I could certainly 
share the information with them. 
 
But I want to turn to the benefit to people from a very hot 
economy. And one of the strongest benefits of course is the 
ability to have a good minimum wage because a lot of people 
today do work in the service sector, and that means that they’re 
working in minimum wage employment. And sometimes as an 
economy gets more competitive, employers will pay more 
because they have to compete with the person down the street 
who’s wanting to hire that same person. 
 
But we did announce a three-stage increase to the minimum 
wage, from 6.65 to 7.05 last September 1; 7.55 on March 1, 
2006. And then it’ll be moving again to 7.95 on March 1, 2007. 
And we’re very proud of that, Madam Deputy Speaker, because 
minimum wage wasn’t always so. 
 
In fact it’s always an interesting fact to me that one of the 
reasons the minimum wage was established many years ago 
was to help women raising children from being destitute and 
from going on the streets to earn money. And this was a very 
important thing. So it really started out initially as a protection 
for women and children and has expanded to be thought of as a 
way to address quality-of-life issues for low-income working 
people. 
 
And of course we do as well in Saskatchewan have a 
low-income wage supplement so that families who even with a 
minimum wage do not have adequacy, there is the ability to 
have that income supplemented by a range of programs, 
services, child care subsidies, transportation subsidies, etc., that 
make it very much easier for people to live. 
 
I contrast that, Madam Deputy Speaker, with an article I read 
recently about Alberta and the huge number of people living on 
the streets, people who have been fooled into going to the land 
of milk and honey only to find out that someone who’s starting 
out there can’t afford a place to live. And that’s even if they 
could find one. And so they’re having a problem which you 
wouldn’t think would exist in a very strong economy. They’re 
having a problem of very low-income people living on the 
streets. And I’m sure that is reaching more crisis proportions as 
the weather gets colder and colder. And hopefully they will use 
that very rich economy they’ve got to do something about that 
situation, and not do as has been done by some governments in 
the past and buy people bus tickets out of sight. 
 
The other thing, Mr. Speaker, that we’ve done . . . I keep calling 
you, Mr. Speaker. I’m going to have to get better glasses, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 

One of the other things that we’ve done recently is to establish a 
family holiday in February. And I think this is hugely important 
for a couple of reasons. I don’t know anybody today that isn’t 
too busy. I’m sure that kids are wishing that their parents were 
home more often, that they had more time to do stuff with them, 
that they could all be together as a family and do some things. 
And I know that’s what my granddaughter says to me 
frequently, you know, when do I get my day to spend some 
time? 
 
So I’m hoping that everybody here and everybody in the 
province really takes advantage of Family Day, to dedicate that 
day to doing some special activity with their family because I 
think that is really what it’s all about. And sometimes just by 
giving something a name and declaring it, you can get people 
excited about building a family project around it or a family 
outing. 
 
And these kinds of things, I think, are particularly important in 
the busy world that we live in today where everybody’s off 
doing their own thing or else sitting on their computer or some 
other thing like that. When really, what makes us feel good is to 
spend time together with people that we love and care about. 
And so I’m very happy about that day off and again urge people 
to make good use of it. 
 
One of the things I do want to talk about is health. You know, 
we talk about health a lot, and there’s no question that doctors 
and hospitals and all those things are hugely important to health 
care — drug plans, all of those things. But also what’s very 
important to health is education. 
 
The many studies that have been done about health care over 
the years have drawn a very strong link between education and 
health care. And the better educated people are, the healthier 
they tend to be. And that’s not only because they can be better 
informed about what makes you healthy — good food, exercise, 
healthy living — but also they tend to then be able to get better 
jobs. And when you have a better job, you can afford a better 
diet. And so education is very fundamental to health and 
well-being. 
 
And certainly when we talk about investments in health, we’re 
not talking just about investments in the medical system. We’re 
talking broadly about housing, about education, and other areas 
of people’s lives. 
 
We are very committed to a publicly funded health care system 
where people never have the experience many people have in 
the US [United States] at arriving at a hospital and being denied 
treatment, certainly an experience that our historic leader 
Tommy Douglas had when his family was in need of treatment 
and they had no way to pay the doctor. And people’s 
commitment to something often comes out of a personal 
experience where they have experienced a huge injustice. 
 
And that’s part of our work here when people come here who 
have experienced a problem, then we have to make a decision 
about how to respond to that and I think generally, more often 
than not, do very well. But it’s always difficult, Mr. Speaker, 
because if there’s one thing you learn when you’re elected, is 
that there’s always more needs in the world than there is money 
to pay for them. And that is probably one of the toughest things 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 635 

about being an elected person. 
 
But, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have a great education 
system, with many investments in elementary, secondary, 
pre-kindergarten, world-class universities, four skills training 
campuses, a regional education system. And it’s these 
educational supports — including one that I’m very proud of, 
the only First Nations and Métis education institutions in 
Canada — means that we’re able to connect to our 
communities’ education needs in a way that’s not possible in 
many other places. 
 
So I want to say, Madam Speaker, that I want to move: 
 

That this Assembly recognize the government’s ongoing 
commitment to ensuring that young people have every 
opportunity to be successful and raise a family here in 
Saskatchewan. 
 

And we certainly intend to do our part, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Regina Rosemont and seconded by the member for Saskatoon 
Massey Place: 
 

That this Assembly recognize the government’s ongoing 
commitment to ensuring that young people have every 
opportunity to be successful and raise a family here in 
Saskatchewan. 
 

I recognize the member for Saskatoon Massey Place, the 
Minister of Industry and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, and I’m very pleased to rise to second the motion. 
 
And I want to talk about the positive economy that is going on 
in Saskatchewan and the positive environment there is for 
young people. And in part of my remarks, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, I’m going to refer to some things that have been said 
by the opposition about this, and then I’m going to demonstrate 
how what the opposition has said is not accurate. 
 
But I want to begin my remarks, Madam Deputy Speaker, by 
saying that not everyone in the province agrees with the doom 
and gloom and negative attitude we hear from the opposition. I 
want to quote from the Saskatchewan young entrepreneurs 
recently in the media. This is the same group, by the way, that 
last year the member from Silver Springs claimed were 
cheering the Leader of the Opposition and they had to . . . 
Actually the young entrepreneurs sent out a release saying that 
they were non-partisan and that they did not support the Leader 
of the Opposition. That’s what they had to say, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. But their president, Madam Deputy Speaker, says this. 
He says . . . And that is Rick Peddle. He says: 
 

The recent changes to the tax structure are helping to keep 
young business people [in Saskatchewan] and giving . . . 
[them] ammunition to attract others back to the province. 
 

He says, contrary to the opposition, and I’m quoting, Madam 
Deputy Speaker: 
 

The recent tax changes are definitely a plus, capital tax is a 
big one and just the attitude of being open for business and 
just the change of attitude is a very positive thing for this 
province. 
 

He goes on to say that: 
 

Young business people have been able to find jobs for 
themselves or their partners which has enabled them to 
move back to Saskatchewan from Alberta, something that 
hasn’t happened in awhile. 
 

And I want to say, Madam Deputy Speaker, something that 
certainly did not happen when those people were in office in the 
1980s. 
 
In fact you know I know that the opposition doesn’t like it when 
we refer to things that actually happened in the 1980s, and they 
like to say that well, we didn’t have anything to do with that so 
why are you asking us about it. But I want to point this out, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
In 1985 a government task force on youth employment called 
the Saskatchewan youth employment development committee 
was created to deal with this problem of the youth leaving the 
province under the Conservative government. And guess who 
one of the youth members appointed to this committee was, 
Madam Deputy Speaker? It was none other than the present 
Leader of the Opposition. Now what actually happened? What 
did that committee accomplish? Well I’ll tell you what it 
accomplished. Five years later there were 17,000 fewer young 
people working in the province, and there was a net 
out-migration of 5,500 people under 25 in the province. 
 
Now the opposition likes to say, Madam Deputy Speaker, that 
everything is bad in Saskatchewan. I want to refer to what is 
actually happening in Saskatchewan. Then I want to say what 
the opposition says about it. Here’s what’s happening. In 
October 2006 there were 21,800 more people working in 
Saskatchewan than a year before, and 8,000 of those were 
young people. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[11:30] 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — That’s what the fact is. They don’t like to 
hear the fact, but I’m going to repeat it for the opposition: 
21,800 more people working in Saskatchewan than a year 
before, and 8,000 of those were young people. It’s an all-time 
record for jobs in the province, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Now the economy is going well. Everybody knows things are 
going well. I talk to business people every day that say things 
are going well. What does the opposition say? Listen to this, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. They say our employable age people 
— this is the member from Melfort; he says — are all leaving. 
He says they’re all, everybody’s leaving, yet 8,000 more young 
people working, 21, 800 more people working. He says 
everybody’s leaving. 



636 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

But not to be undone, the member from Cypress Hills, he says 
we’re in a death spiral, a death spiral — 21,800 more people 
working, economic growth near the top of the country. And 
they say we’re in a death spiral. But not to be undone by that, 
the Leader of the Opposition had this to say, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, he said, our economy is still hooked up to the NDP 
suicide machine, he said. 
 
I mean, talk about over-the-top, desperate, political rhetoric 
from a group of men — mainly men and some women — who 
want what, Madam Deputy Speaker? They want power, as the 
Minister of Highways said the other day, naked ambition for 
power. That’s what they have. 
 
And, you know, the Leader of the Opposition was up on his feet 
last week, and he made this statement. He said the economy 
was in a mess. I went to Saskatoon the same day. I was talking 
to a business person. And you know what he did? He laughed 
about that. He said, Madam Deputy Speaker, he said it’s not 
credible what the Leader of the Opposition says because he 
wants to say that the economy is not growing, while at the same 
time the facts from Statistics Canada are, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, 21,800 more people working than a year ago, 8,000 
more young people working. 
 
And I think that that party over there . . . [inaudible interjection] 
. . . and they’re chirping from their seats about how many left 
the province because they can never stand any good news. They 
should take a page and listen to the advice of the young people 
of this province, Madam Deputy Speaker, who say this, and I’m 
quoting. They say — the young professionals and entrepreneurs 
— they say this: 
 

. . . we would do well to hold up, as examples, those who 
have either migrated to Saskatchewan instead of away 
from Saskatchewan and those who have left and since 
returned.” 
 

Then they say, “It is vital to accentuate the positive and 
eliminate the negative.” 
 
And all they do, Madam Deputy Speaker, and they are doing it 
right now from their seats, trying to shout me down, and I want 
the people watching this to know that they are trying to shout 
me down when I say that there are more jobs in this province. 
They are totally negative, Madam Deputy Speaker. They say 
that everything is bad in Saskatchewan and everything is 
wonderful in the province of Alberta. 
 
Here’s what the young people have to say. Dallas Carpenter 
moved back to Saskatchewan. He says it, “. . . was the best 
thing I could have done for my career and lifestyle. My career 
has progressed significantly and . . . [we] were able to purchase 
a house.” 
 
Maria Groenen says this: “I can’t afford to live in Alberta. The 
money I’ve saved would have been spent on rents I would pay 
in Alberta.” 
 
Brent Edwards said: 
 

. . . the whole idea of going back to Saskatchewan was just 
great — cheap healthcare, cheap housing, cheap 

everything; my expenses are nothing now compared to 
what they were before. 
 
Alberta tries to lure you with dollars, but that’s all there is. 
Out here you can actually spread a paycheque [he says]. 

 
Colin Luciuk says, “When we looked . . . at the job 
opportunities and . . . what the real estate situation was, we 
decided to leave after twelve years.” And they came back to 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Dennis Dale, the president of Jay’s Moving says, “what is 
happening is a lot of people that have moved from 
Saskatchewan have moved back because of the cost of housing 
and everything else.” 
 
David Parkinson says, “When I came back to Saskatchewan . . . 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I know that members get anxious to 
enter into debate, but I’d ask all hon. members to allow the 
member on their feet to speak and then your turn will come. 
Thank you. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — And I want the people watching this to 
know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that when I say something 
positive about our wonderful province, opposite me are a bunch 
of people that are trying to shout me down. And when they get 
up on their feet after I sit down, Madam Deputy Speaker, they 
will say negative things about this great province. 
 
But I am going to continue quoting what David Parkinson says. 
He says, “When I came back to Saskatchewan I just felt that 
here I have an opportunity to . . . create a business and get it 
going, and everyone here [has] welcomed me with open arms 
when I did get back.” 
 
And you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, they should listen to 
the young people. And again I want to say the young 
professionals and entrepreneurs said to us, “It is vital to 
accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative.” 
 
And as long as we have people like the members opposite that 
trash this province on a daily basis and say that nothing good 
happens in this province, Madam Deputy Speaker, we still will 
have some people that are prepared to believe their snake oil 
that somehow the economy of Saskatchewan isn’t growing. 
 
But on this side of the House, Madam Deputy Speaker, we are 
proud of our province. We love our province. We know there 
are great things happening in our province. We’re going to be 
positive. We’re going to continue to fight the negativity that 
comes from over there. 
 
And I predict, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the end of the day 
when people of Saskatchewan have to judge who has a plan and 
who just criticizes, they’re going to decide that they’d rather 
remain positive about the future of this province than listen to 
them. Thank you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 637 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. It’s 
always a pleasure to rise in the Assembly to speak on behalf of 
the people that I represent, and particularly on a topic that is so 
important to our province and the young people that are our 
future. 
 
You know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I don’t know whether or 
not to give my remarks or to counter everything that I just heard 
over the last 10 or 15 minutes, Madam Deputy Speaker. But I 
will say, I will say . . . I will say that, you know, the Minister of 
Industry and Resources, he says that we’re negative and I want 
to say that I’m very positive about this province. I love being in 
Saskatchewan. I love living here. We have a great province. 
The only thing I’m negative about, Madam Deputy Speaker, is 
the government that we have opposite. And we’ll have a 
change. 
 
You know, he talks about our negative attitude. And I will say 
that the government did make some good decisions on changing 
some of the business taxes. But what kind of attitude is it, what 
kind of message does it send when they send out messages like 
greedy corporate hucksters? What does that send? What kind of 
attitude does that send to the business community in our 
province and people that are looking outside? What kind of 
message does it send to have an attitude that when people leave 
the province there’s more for the rest of us? I think that’s 
shameful. I think that’s shameful. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, you know it’s interesting. This 
government likes to talk about what’s happened in the past but 
they’ve been the government for 15 years. What have they been 
doing about this important issue in the last 15 years? 
 
You know, and I see a news article from today’s Leader-Post 
talking about, talking about, talking about the Premier’s dinner 
last night. And I see that it was reported it was close to 550 
people attend, and I think in NDP arithmetic that’s about 315 or 
something like that. But, you know, this is what the Premier 
said. He’s quoted in the newspaper. He said, “I could not have 
said, when I became premier of this great province (five years 
ago), in complete confidence to a young person, ‘Your future 
can be here.’” 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I graduated from university about five 
years ago, about the time when the Premier took office, became 
the Premier of the province. And I think it is shameful that a 
Premier would say that. He couldn’t say that this was a great 
place to be. What kind of a message is that sending? What kind 
of a message is it sending to young people? Because, you know, 
five years ago, you know, my wife and I made the decision that 
we were going to stay in Saskatchewan. And we had 
opportunities to go elsewhere and . . . But it just sends a bad 
message when even the Premier of the province admits that he 
didn’t have confidence in our province only five years ago. I 
think that’s pretty, pretty shameful. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to speak a little bit about what 
young people are saying and I think the government members 
would know this. The Canada West Foundation report that has 
. . . 25 per cent of people under the age of 35 in our province 
today think that they’ll be moving out of the province within 

five years. Now what, you know . . . I think if you look at our 
province and all the things that we have going for us, all our 
resources . . . And I come from an area of the province that is 
blessed with a lot of natural resources. But you know, it’s kind 
of telling a message to this government that even with all that 
we have going for us, record prices in our resources, that yet we 
still see 4,500 people leave in the last year. 
 
And I would like to quote, Madam Deputy Speaker, the 
executive director . . . The executive director for the Prairie 
policy institute, Mr. Al Evans, was quoted in the Saskatoon 
StarPhoenix on July 7 of this year. He said — and I’ll quote 
him — he said, quote: 
 

“We honestly believe Saskatchewan is the best place to be, 
could be the best place to be in 100 years,” said Evans. 
“We have all the ingredients to be a powerhouse. We just 
don’t know how to bake the cake.” 

 
Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, all you have to do to realize 
what that means is, look opposite. They’re the government in 
this province. They’re the Government of Saskatchewan. 
They’re the ones that are in charge of . . . I guess to use Mr. 
Evans’ comments, they’re the ones that are baking the cake. 
And yet we continue to see young people leave our province. 
 
Now, Madam Deputy Speaker, I also want to talk about some 
other issues. And I know the motion put forward by the 
government is to talk about that young people have every 
opportunity to be successful. And the member from Rosemont 
that moved the motion talked about that when it’s good 
economic times, there’s a responsibility to make sure that 
there’s social progress, and I agree with that. 
 
So when we speak of young people I think we also need to 
speak of our record in this province of having the second 
highest percentage of children, almost 50 per cent are . . . 
Saskatchewan has recorded the second highest percentage of 
children as clients of food banks in this province. That reminds 
me of something that was said quite a number of years ago by 
the Premier when he was a member, when he sat in opposition. 
He dreamt of a province, he dreamt of a province where food 
banks would be a thing of the past. And yet under his leadership 
in times of prosperity, times of prosperity, food bank usage has 
increased by 3.7 per cent. And you know, that’s just . . . it’s a 
shameful, shameful record of this government, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
There’s some other interesting notes especially around the area 
that he represents in Saskatoon, and I think this is Saskatoon as 
a whole, but close to 40,000 people in Saskatoon live in 
poverty, are considered poor. And almost thirty-one and a half 
thousand children live with parents who are on assistance. And 
you know, it’s just they say one thing and they obviously do 
another, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
You know, Madam Deputy Speaker, if you look at some of the 
problems that this government has had in keeping young 
people, part of it is training, part of it is young people having 
the ability not only to be trained in this province, but then to 
have a job after they’re finished. 
 
And I do want to close, Madam Deputy Speaker, on two points. 



638 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

One is to talk about . . . and I know the members opposite 
talked about experiences that people that they know have left 
the province, and I’ve had family members that have left the 
province. But I know of one family, Madam Deputy Speaker, in 
this province that are becoming very good friends, and I think 
their experiences are fairly typical of a lot of families in this 
province. It’s quite a large family. It is seven children in the 
family. And just to run down where . . . All the children are 
either between the ages of their early 30s to about 20: 
 
[11:45] 
 
The oldest daughter, seven years ago, moved to Edmonton. 
She’s a physiotherapist and her husband is a doctor; in fact he’s 
a specialist. They have children that they’re raising in Alberta. 
And you know, those are professions that are in demand in this 
province and yet they’ve had to leave the province. 
 
The oldest son works in the financial industry in Calgary. And 
he had to leave the province because he just couldn’t find a job 
after he graduated a number of years ago. 
 
There’s another daughter. She’s in nursing school in Alberta. 
She couldn’t get into the program. She didn’t want to have to 
wait the long waiting list to get into the program here. So she’s 
training to become an RN [registered nurse]. And she’s married 
to a young man from Saskatoon, or getting married to a young 
man from Saskatoon who’s also in Calgary now. 
 
And there’s also a son who’s a skilled tradesman. He’s a 
plumber in Calgary. And he couldn’t get into a technical school 
— the wait was too long — and so he’s had to move. 
 
And you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, this family’s just one 
of many that I know that have had to leave the province. So 
before my time ends here, I will be moving a motion that reads: 
 

All the words after “that” be removed and the following be 
substituted: 

 
this Assembly condemns the government’s lack of 
commitment to ensure that young people have every 
opportunity to be successful and raise a family here in 
Saskatchewan. 

 
Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Thank you. I thank the member for 
debate, but I am to inform the Assembly that the amendment is 
not in order. It’s the same effect as voting down the motion 
before the Assembly. So in effect, the amendment is not in 
order. We’ll continue with the debate on the main motion. I 
recognize the member for Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. It 
is indeed a pleasure to enter into this most positive debate about 
the future of our province and about the role that young people 
can and will have in the development of our province. I very 
much enjoy talking about young people in our province and the 
need to keep more of them here, something that’s lost on the 
government members opposite. 

I think the debate can be characterized in the context of an 
article that appeared in the Saskatoon StarPhoenix back on 
December 26, day after Christmas 2005. What does the article 
say? And I quote: 
 

How can it be that Saskatchewan, with its almost 
unlimited opportunities for growth, and situated in the 
heart of a country that boasts the second-highest rate of 
population growth amongst G8 nations, continues to see 
its human resources slip away? Population loss reversal 
needs . . . [to change. Saskatchewan needs a] cultural 
change. 
 

Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think that that summarizes 
what we’re talking about today, about the history of this NDP 
government for the last 15 years and what they’ve done. They 
like to talk about what happened in the ’80s. They like to talk 
about what happened since 1944, but I tell you, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, it is not a good story. I’d rather talk about what’s 
happening today. And the Minister of Industry and Resources 
talked about the Saskatchewan Young Professionals and 
Entrepreneurs and what they . . . their ideas. 
 
What I’d like to do in my time allocated today is talk about their 
ideas and gauge that against what this government is doing. 
And, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is not a pretty picture, not a 
pretty picture whatsoever. 
 
SYPE [Saskatchewan Young Professionals and Entrepreneurs] 
has said that we need to be able to compete on the world stage. 
That’s something that needs to be done. They realize that there 
is a global economy. But it’s something that members opposite 
refuse to talk about. They talk about the . . . SYPE talks about 
the human element. Well the human element is the loss of 2,000 
more people in the first quarter of 2006. Saskatchewan’s 
population dropped below 990,000 for the first time since July 
1982 — not a statistic that anybody likes to talk about. But in 
talking about the real situation that we’re in in this province, it’s 
a statistic that needs to be mentioned. 
 
There’s many, many reasons why this has happened. Fifteen 
years of high-tax policies of this NDP government I would say 
is close to the top of the list, if not right at the top of the list. 
And that’s what members of SYPE and other youth 
organizations across the province know, that the tax policies of 
this government have done anything but attract or retain young 
people in Saskatchewan. That is exactly true and I’m glad that 
the Minister of Industry and Resources agrees with it. 
 
Another thing that SYPE talked about is the need for innovation 
in Saskatchewan. The need . . . Not only words but the need to 
have deliverables, to make sure that innovation takes place in 
this province. Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, what do we see in 
The StarPhoenix from a couple of days ago, Tuesday, 
November 28, and I’m sure the Minister of Industry and 
Resources has read this article. What does it talk about? The 
synchrotron in Saskatchewan landing $40 million of federal 
funding through the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. A 
very important program, an important program for the economy 
of this province; an important program to the youth of this 
province. 
 
Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, it’s good news that 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 639 

Saskatchewan researchers and Saskatchewan professionals who 
have worked hard and applied for these grants were successful 
in getting them but, Madam Deputy Speaker, that’s only part of 
the story. Canadian Foundation for Innovation relies on money 
from the provincial government as well. What response did we 
hear from the provincial government? What did we hear from 
them when they were asked about how they contribute to the 
Canadian foundation? They weren’t available for comment. 
 
Now, Madam Deputy Speaker, in fairness we’ll wait and hear 
for the official response but, Madam Deputy Speaker, we 
shouldn’t even have to wait. We should have a program in this 
province that addresses the need for matching funding to enable 
to leverage funding from Ottawa. It should be an automatic 
program and we certainly . . . we don’t have it here in this 
province. 
 
Other things that the young people of Saskatchewan are talking 
about are the nuclear industry. They ask questions about it. 
They want to know; they want to understand. They ask the 
question of the government and the government says, well we 
haven’t seen a business case for nuclear development in this 
province. Well those that try, those that try to get the 
information, they run into a roadblock when SaskPower says, 
well trust us. We can’t give you the information but there’s no 
business case here. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, what young people across this 
province want is the information so they can decide for 
themselves. It’s much like what the uranium companies want in 
this province — to be able to see that information so they can 
make that decision. But more so, what they want is leadership 
from this government. Not just more words, not just a flip-flop 
about it being the dirtiest type of energy ever created. We heard 
that from the Premier. We hear different things now from the 
government but still mixed signals and it just isn’t, it isn’t 
boding well for the future of the youth of this province. They 
want that information. 
 
Young people are asking questions about oil sands development 
in this province, why we’re not seeing the job creation in that 
sector that we should. They go back to the history of 
Saskatchewan and what happened in the ’40s and ’50s and ’60s 
and ’70s in this province, why oil companies chose to leave this 
province. It had a lot to do with the socialist philosophy of the 
government at the time. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, the time is running by very quickly 
and I want to talk about many, many other things. I know I’ve 
got the captive interest about . . . of the group opposite, Madam 
Deputy Speaker. But I want to talk about . . . I want to talk 
about the need for vision in this province. It’s something that 
we haven’t seen from members opposite. 
 
And the Minister of Industry and Resources, he talked about a 
forum that took place in Saskatoon last year where 2,000 young 
people were brought together to talk about the future and the 
vision. Who was invited to speak at that? The minister worries 
about who organized the group. It’s less important who 
organized it, but it’s more important who the young people of 
Saskatchewan chose to be the speakers at that event, Madam 
Deputy Speaker. 
 

Do you know who they chose? Yes, they chose Bill Rancic, 
who was the apprentice. Someone who captured the 
imagination of people across Saskatchewan. They had Catriona 
Le May Doan there. They had people like Robyn Regehr, who 
is a successful professional hockey player. And do you know 
who else they asked when they wanted a vision for the youth of 
this province? They asked the Leader of the Opposition to be 
one of their guest speakers. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — And, Madam Deputy Speaker, I can tell 
you with all sincerity that to this day I still hear from young 
people across the province that were in attendance at that event 
and say bar none that was the best visionary speech for the 
young people of our province that they have ever, ever heard. 
Madam Deputy Speaker, they were very, very pleased with 
their choice of having the Leader of the Opposition speak. 
 
And, Madam Deputy Speaker, we talk about things in this 
Assembly, but what is more important is when we go out of this 
Assembly and talk to the young people one-on-one. And I had 
that opportunity. I had the opportunity during the Weyburn-Big 
Muddy by-election to talk to many young people across the 
Weyburn-Big Muddy constituency. And I must say it was just 
very positive to see the number of young people that were 
involved in that campaign, supporting one of their own, 
supporting the youngest member of this legislature. Young 
people from across that constituency were there supporting him 
so they could have a voice in this legislature. Young people 
were very engaged. 
 
And, Madam Deputy Speaker, the reason that I’m so positive 
about this is that I’m seeing the same thing happening in 
Yorkton. I’m seeing the same thing happening in Meadow 
Lake. I’m seeing the same thing happen in Saskatoon — where 
young people are saying enough is enough. Young people are 
saying that a government needs to change, a government should 
be in for 10 to 12 years, do their thing, and then get out of the 
way. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, we see a government whose expiry 
date is long past. It’s time for a new generation of leaders. It’s 
time for somebody who has the vision like the Leader of the 
Opposition to put a plan in place, to put a plan like the 
Enterprise Saskatchewan — that’s what young people want to 
see. They want to see a plan. They know that all problems can’t 
be solved overnight. They know that 15 years of this NDP 
administration, we won’t be able to turn it around overnight but 
they want to see a plan. They’ve got a plan from the Leader of 
the Opposition. 
 
They want to see a plan from this government. And, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, they’ve been sadly, sadly disappointed. They 
haven’t received that information, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Well young people are engaged . . . I hope that young people 
are watching this debate. I hope that they have a chance, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, a chance to exercise their franchise. 
And many of those in their late teens will be voting for the first 
time. They will have an opportunity to make change in this 
province like never before, an opportunity to vote for the vision 
and the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. 



640 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

Thank you for allowing me to enter this debate, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Fairview. 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was 
listening to the members speaking and wondering about them 
not being negative. I wondered who it was that voted on the 
Throne Speech and the budget on some of the most positive 
changes we’ve ever experienced in Saskatchewan. 
 
But, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to talk about the 
unprecedented wealth that is being generated here and, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, most notably what I’d like to talk about is 
about the minimum wage increases that we have announced. 
We announced them a few years ago and we announced them 
over a gradual period of time, Madam Deputy Speaker. And 
what did the opposition think of that, Madam Deputy Speaker? 
What did they think? They came up and they thought the whole 
thing was a negative experience. 
 
I’m proud, Madam Deputy Speaker, to repeat that promise here; 
that as of March 1 of next year the minimum wage will be 
increased to 7.95 an hour. Raising the minimum wage will put 
more money into the pockets of working people and their 
families. Madam Deputy Speaker, this was a plan that was in 
place for over a year — for over two years — and a perfect 
example of the ongoing and continual commitment of this 
government and this Premier to making Saskatchewan the best 
place to live, work, and raise a family. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, Saskatchewan has always been a 
leader in fostering balance between work and family. That is 
exactly why once again we want to help everyone benefit from 
a strong economy. Madam Deputy Speaker, that is why in our 
Throne Speech we announced a new Family Day, a statutory 
holiday in February. In those dark days of February, Madam 
Deputy Speaker — and they are cold as I recall because I was 
elected in a by-election in February — families need a chance 
for a rest, for a day to stay home with their families and to visit. 
 
[12:00] 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, another tangible benefit that will help 
make young people a decision to stay and work in this province 
is the youth apprenticeship expansion that was announced in 
this year’s budget. Five thousand high school students will have 
the opportunity to learn more about careers that are available to 
them right here in Saskatchewan, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
That’s 5,000 young people who are being given a positive 
reason to make Saskatchewan the place they choose to live and 
work from. 
 
We’re building the workforce of tomorrow, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, and as I mentioned earlier, all this in a budget which 
was attacked by those members opposite. In this budget we 
increased training spaces by over 2,700 spaces. That’s hundreds 
of people every year that are being prepared to take place in the 
workplace of Saskatchewan. 
 

Madam Deputy Speaker, while we are doing this, the federal 
Conservative government is cutting funding to adult literacy 
programs. Our government is backfilling and improving 
services here. We need the young people and all people. We 
need to give them the tools to participate in a modern economy. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, on the question of tools, we have also 
introduced a tool tax credit this past spring. As pointed out at 
that time, many of today’s young tradespeople need to purchase 
tools as a condition of their employment. They have to buy 
these tools with their after-tax dollars, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
and it seems only fair that they should also benefit from the 
booming economy that we are now experiencing. There are 
15,000 working men and women that will benefit from the tax 
credit, Madam Deputy Speaker. That’s 15,000 young people 
who are seeing the benefits of a booming economy and 15,000 
young families. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, Saskatchewan’s labour climate is 
without doubt one of the best in the country. We have vacations 
of three weeks after one year, four weeks after ten. These allow 
workers in the province a break they so richly deserve. Mr. 
Speaker, this is very positive for young families in 
Saskatchewan. These are the kind of things that will address the 
issues of students and allow them to have opportunities right 
here at home. 
 
Again, Madam Deputy Speaker, the need to benefit all of the 
people is why we’re continuing the commitment to providing 
Saskatchewan people with the lowest cost utility bundle. Mr. 
Speaker, under this government, Saskatchewan families will 
feel the real benefits of Saskatchewan’s strong economy. They 
will feel it when they heat their homes. They will feel it when 
they insure their cars. And they will also have access to the 
highest-speed Internet in Canada. Madam Deputy Speaker, it 
was not too many people that could disagree with the lowest 
cost bundle of utilities. And we have the lowest cost, whether 
it’s Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, or British Columbia. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, while we are partnering with citizens, 
municipalities, and school boards, and various groups in our 
province, I want to remind all here of when it was not so. 
Madam Deputy Speaker, they say, say it’s not so. Well I 
remember in the 1980s when the leader was part of the 
governing conservatives and, during that time, this government 
established group homes. They established group homes 
throughout Saskatchewan because they deemed it a better way 
to provide service to group home residents. 
 
Well for the workers, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the workers, 
they stripped them of their rights. They stripped them of their 
rights of overtime. They took away, they took away, through 
some slick interpretations, they did away with the minimum 
rates of pay. They took away the minimum rates of pay. And 
what did this mean, Madam Deputy Speaker? What did this 
mean? It meant that when these workers worked and had to 
sleep overnight at their workplace, they didn’t get paid, Madam 
Deputy Speaker. 
 
And you know what they said, Madam Deputy Speaker? They 
said this was pin money. This was pin money, is what they said. 
Because these workers, Madam Deputy Speaker, a large 
percentage are women workers in this province, Madam Deputy 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 641 

Speaker. And that’s what they did to workers. They stripped 
people of their rights under The Labour Standards Act. 
 
And we hear that today, Madam Deputy Speaker. We hear that 
today. We hear that today because now they are going to war 
with workers and the working people of this province. That’s 
that what the Leader of the Opposition says. He says we’re 
going to go to war. 
 
Well I have this to say to that Leader of the Opposition. We 
defeated you in 1991. And I know they’re in a bit of a rush, 
they’re in a bit of a rush but we have some work to do. We have 
some work to do before we call another election and defeat 
them again, Madam Deputy Speaker, before we defeat them 
again. So they should just be a bit patient about this because 
that’s what’s going to happen, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
But what did our government respond to the group-home 
workers? Madam Deputy Speaker, I’m proud to stand here and 
say that we put in $30 million to wages for the group-home 
workers of this province, $30 million that were taken away 
from these workers. That’s what we did, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I think those members across should 
understand the amounts of money that we have put in, and 
whether into the education sectors or whatever. And I think we 
should hear about those — 1.5 billion into the education 
system, Madam Deputy Speaker, $300 million for universities. 
We’ve frozen university tuition until 2008, and they voted 
against that. We’ve created over 34,000 training spaces and 
32,000 university seats in 2006 and 2007. Madam Deputy 
Speaker, this includes 83 new seats at the Saskatchewan Indian 
Institute of Technologies and, as I mentioned earlier, 134,000 to 
expand the youth apprenticeship program province-wide. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I felt the full brunt of their policies in 
the ’80s because I was a negotiator on behalf of the group 
homes and many other things. So they don’t fool us for a 
second. They don’t fool us for a second. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, at this point in time what I would like 
to do is congratulate all the young people in this province for 
their enthusiasm and their innovation in building a great 
Saskatchewan. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. It’s a 
privilege for me to be able to join the debate today and to read 
this motion. I was almost struck by the humour of it. I don’t 
have a moment’s hesitation in saying that I believe the 
government really has the best intentions at heart, they just 
don’t have a clue how to fulfill the mandate of a government in 
terms of keeping young people in the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, we’ve alluded to the problem of 
out-migration and especially youth retention in several 
instances previously in this House. I think I spent a fair amount 

of time just a week or two ago elaborating the devastating 
consequences of youth out-migration from the constituency of 
Cypress Hills and indicating how if our experience was 
extrapolated over the entire province from constituency to 
constituency, both urban and rural, there would be a complete 
and total loss of young people in the province. 
 
Fortunately some of the other areas of the province don’t 
experience the same out-migration numbers that we have in the 
southwest of Saskatchewan. But nevertheless, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, the consequences to the province are pretty stark and 
pretty serious. And I think we need to be addressing that today. 
 
The fact of the matter is, Madam Deputy Speaker, that when 
you engage people in conversation and ask them about their 
families and where their children are, with rare exception you 
will run into somebody who will say that their children are still 
in Saskatchewan. You often find people who say, well out of 
the three or four children I’ve got, you know one or two are in 
Saskatchewan but the other two are elsewhere. But more and 
more frequently now, Madam Deputy Speaker, what we’re 
hearing from people is that they are here; their children are 
elsewhere. And the consequence for the province of 
Saskatchewan is serious, not just in the short term but 
particularly in the long term. 
 
We find that this is backed up by reports of surveys done. I 
think the Canada West Foundation was the most recent source 
of this type of information where they completed a survey 
which indicated 25 per cent of people in the province of 
Saskatchewan under the age of 35 fully expected themselves to 
be moving out of the province in the next five years. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, that’s not a statistic or a number that 
anybody should take lightly, especially those in power, in 
positions of influence, who have within their mandate an 
opportunity to address specifically the concerns of people in 
that age group. At age 35 and under, you’re just really starting 
life. You’re establishing relationships. You may be getting 
married. You may be starting a family. You’re certainly into the 
workforce in an intensive and deliberate way. You have 
expectations about your future and your career development. 
And that is the age group that provides the most important part 
of our economic engine. 
 
If so much of Saskatchewan’s economy is based on small 
business — as we’ve heard repeatedly from the government, 
and it’s backed up by evidence — those small businesses are 
driven by a consumer economy. And consumers in the age 
range of 25 to 50 are the most likely to spend. But those in the 
age range of 25 to 35 are likely the most important component 
of even that group. 
 
So when we have a report that indicates that 25 per cent of 
young people 35 and under are fully expecting to have to leave 
the province, that doesn’t augur well for the future of this 
province. And it behooves the government to take that kind of 
statistical information very seriously in the policy it develops as 
we go forward in this province. 
 
Apparently the government has not seen fit to do that. Or if they 
have, it’s been inadequate because the statistics are still 
showing increasing out-migration of both total population . . . in 



642 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

terms of total population numbers and in youth out-migration. 
 
You know, Madam Deputy Speaker, we can stand here and talk 
about numbers all day. And we can argue back and forth about 
the impact and the cause and effect and so forth. But it’s really 
important, Madam Deputy Speaker, for us to personalize this. 
And when you bring these out-migration stories down to the 
very personal situations, such as the Marie Broberg case that we 
brought to prominence last spring, a young lady from Gull Lake 
who was on a waiting list at SIAST [Saskatchewan Institute of 
Applied Science and Technology] for six years — six years, 
Madam Deputy Speaker. She virtually was forced to move to 
Alberta to achieve her educational opportunities earlier. 
 
When we hear that kind of a story, when we hear the story of a 
young Ph.D. [Doctor of Philosophy] graduate from the 
University of Saskatchewan who had one job opportunity 
offered to him in the province of Saskatchewan and was 
actively pursued and recruited by a company in Calgary and 
chose — even though he wanted to stay in Saskatchewan — 
chose to move to Calgary to pursue his career opportunities 
there when he became aware of them. 
 
When you hear of those kind of individual, heartbreaking 
stories, those anecdotal instances of people who wanted to stay 
here and found themselves being compelled to leave, it 
reinforces the idea and the acknowledgement that this 
government has not been able to address this issue 
satisfactorily. Young people would like to stay here, but they 
haven’t been allowed to by the policies of this government and 
by the inertia of this government. 
 
And what we found, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that the 
government, the NDP government is a johnny-come-lately to 
the realization of the catastrophe that this out-migration issue is 
posing for our future and for our economic growth and our 
economic prospects. 
 
So, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would say that if this NDP 
government truly believed its own words in this debate, they 
would have acted more forcefully and intentionally to make 
every effort to keep young people in Saskatchewan. The 
response has been woefully inadequate and much too late. 
 
Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I will be supporting the 
amendment. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[12:15] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The motion before the Assembly . . . 
We’ll enter into a question and answer period. And I recognize 
the member for Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. My question will be for the member from Fairview. 
The motion before the House is talking about Saskatchewan 
being a leader and fostering a balance between work and 
family. My question is, how does your government consider the 
balance between work and family for farmers that are leaving 
this province to work in Alberta over the winter? 
 

And in fact last year, the town of Rose Valley had . . . a large 
percentage of their men left home, and the wives were looking 
after not only their children and their home and the livestock, 
but they’re looking after the community. Where was the balance 
between work and family there when the only time the family 
got to see the father was when he got to come home 
occasionally for a few days off? There was no balance. And this 
family . . . They’ve risked and put all their capital into their 
farm. They worked for years to make sure that it can stay 
viable, but they weren’t allowed to stay there. The question is, 
where is the balance for farmers? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Fairview. 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — . . . for the question, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. This government has worked hard, and in the 
Department of Labour we also have and are concerned about 
work and balance in family. And we have addressed it, as I 
have earlier said, with the vacations that we have, Madam 
Deputy Speaker. We’ve addressed it on many fronts and we 
continue to work in there. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, the funding for education and our 
daycare dollars that we have attempted to do which were 
deducted by the . . . or not followed through by the 
Conservative government, are a great concern to us. And I think 
that the member across should be more concerned about issues 
like, in terms of the funding and the help that can be provided, 
than simply criticizing our budget and the Throne Speech. 
Thank you. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Massey Place. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. My 
question is for the member from Saskatoon Silver Springs. He 
stated in his speech that certain people were complaining about 
high taxes in Saskatchewan. Will the member from Saskatoon 
Silver Springs admit that income taxes in Saskatchewan on the 
personal side have been decreased by approximately 35 per cent 
since tax reform was implemented in 1999? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Saskatoon Silver Springs, the 
member for Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Madam Deputy Speaker, it’s a pleasure 
to answer the question. I could get used to answering these 
questions, you know, in the future, that’s for sure. But, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, it’s important to hear what . . . or to talk about 
what the experts in this province have to say. 
 
Mr. Jack Vicq, who was the author of the Vicq commission 
report, both the first one on income tax and the second one on 
corporate taxes, Madam Deputy Speaker, what did he have to 
say? Well he said that Saskatchewan had the highest effective 
tax rate, not only in Canada but in his opinion in entire North 
America and maybe the world, Madam Deputy Speaker. That is 
the tax situation that this province has experienced under this 
NDP government for the last 15 years — the highest corporate 
capital taxes, the highest personal income tax, the highest rate 
of income tax for low-income earners. The minister likes to talk 
about the low-income earners in Saskatchewan. 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 643 

We had a plan to put more money in their pocket. What 
happened, Madam Deputy Speaker? Members on that side of 
the House voted against it. They voted it down. They like to 
talk about having increases in the minimum wage, but who does 
that benefit, Madam Deputy Speaker? It doesn’t benefit the 
workers as much as it should. It benefits the government 
coffers. Madam Deputy Speaker, I can assure the members 
opposite that we will have more ideas on property taxes and 
other taxes for them. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Weyburn-Big Muddy. 
 
Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, my question is for the member for Saskatoon 
Fairview. Madam Deputy Speaker, how can young people 
believe that the NDP government will create jobs and 
opportunities for our young people when it was this government 
that attempted to bring in most available hours legislation, the 
job-killing monster as it’s been called? 
 
They would have done nothing to improve the chances of 
young people to gain employment in our province, and in fact it 
was opposed by student organizations all across this province. 
So how would this legislation have helped young people in the 
province, and would he support the government trying to bring 
it back? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — . . . Saskatoon Fairview. 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — Madam Deputy Speaker, I know the 
member for Weyburn-Big Muddy has often said that he cares 
about the present. But I think we should go back to the 1980s 
on this question when that party was in power and saw the 
exodus of young people out of this province, and their policies. 
 
And let me talk about most available hours. Let me talk about 
most available hours. Well they laugh, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
The issue is, most available hours was brought by because of 
the economic basket case that they created. Those folks over 
there created that. They created more part-time positions where 
people were unemployed. And what happened was that most 
people had to take jobs, part-time jobs. And what did that do to 
the students? The students were pushed out. They were pushed 
out into other jobs. That’s what happened. That’s what 
happened in the ’80s. Yes it did. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
My question is for the member from Regina Rosemont. The 
NDP have failed to provide educational opportunities for a good 
many of our youth who wish to have post-secondary training in 
this province. We have seen too many of the students who wish 
to attend post-secondary forced to go out of this province to 
receive their training. For my constituency they go to Brandon 
and Winnipeg and Minot and Calgary and Medicine Hat and 
Edmonton but they have a hard time getting into their own 
province in Saskatchewan. 
 
So to the member: why has this NDP government failed to 
provide the proper number of training spots and educational 

opportunities for the students of this province which would 
encourage them to stay in Saskatchewan rather than driving 
them out of the province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Rosemont. 
 
Ms. Crofford: — One of the things that’s been very difficult to 
have the opposition understand is that you can’t spend money 
you don’t have. But as soon as we did have the money due to 
the actions we took to improve the economy and the 
competitiveness of taxes, both business and personal, the fact is 
is that we added 5,000 new training spaces in this year alone. 
And we’re going to keep going up. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Fairview. 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — . . . the member for Cypress Hills, Madam 
Deputy Speaker. In a recent Leader-Post article the headline 
read, “Jobs, Jobs, Jobs. . .” Madam Deputy Speaker, “Jobs, 
Jobs, Jobs . . .” Now the members have voted against most 
everything and continually negatively speak on this. What I 
would like to hear from this member is, does he support that 
article and does he support this economy and does he support 
the jobs, jobs, jobs in this province? 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, I’m pleased to 
answer that question because I addressed that very question in a 
speech I participated in and presented in this House a week or 
10 days ago. 
 
The jobs may be in fact there, but the statistical evidence says 
that under this government, this NDP government, in the last 
two years we’ve had 18,000 young people leave this province. 
So if we’ve got 15,000 jobs right now, but we chased 18,000 
out of the province in the previous two years, you know, what’s 
up with that, Madam Deputy Speaker? If those students, those 
individuals who left, that compiled or made up that particular 
number of out-migration experience, then if they had been here, 
they would have filled those jobs. It’s not whether or not there 
are jobs here. It is the issue now of why young people and 
others still find it necessary to leave the province. 
 
I have, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Stats Canada report of 
25- to 29-year-olds, 30- to 34-year-olds, and 35- to 
39-year-olds. Between 1996 and 2006, the number is down on 
each occasion. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Arm 
River-Watrous. 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. My 
question is to the member from Regina Rosemont. They talk 
about being family friendly. Well in my constituency, we’ve 
had numbers of young people leaving. When I talk to young 
people, they have no confidence in this government at all. 
 



644 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

So my question to them is, how can they actually believe that 
they’re family friendly? When I go around my constituency, 
every young person out there, the only question they ask me is, 
when will the next election be, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I thank all members for their 
participation in the debate today. The time allocated for the 
75-minute debate is now ended. We would go to priority in 
government orders. 
 

PRIVATE MEMBERS’ PUBLIC BILLS AND ORDERS 
 

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

PRIVATE MEMBERS’ MOTIONS 
 

Motion No. 1 — Loss of Confidence in the Government 
 

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by Mr. Elhard.] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you. Thank you, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. It’s a great pleasure to join in to the debate this 
Thursday afternoon. It seems to be a weekly tradition every 
Thursday afternoon — I’m sure people start turning their TVs 
off about now — but Thursday afternoon to discuss the 
province’s confidence and the opposition’s confidence in this 
government. Of course we put forward a motion, a motion that 
says: 
 

That this Assembly no longer has the confidence in the 
Premier and his government. 

 
Two Thursdays ago I know the member from Cypress Hills 
spoke for quite a while on the fact that there just is no 
confidence in the government, whether it’s in this Assembly or 
throughout the province. 
 
I had the opportunity to speak a little bit two Thursdays ago and 
for a little while last week. Since that time, I’ve also had the 
opportunity to look at what I had to say, read through the 
Hansard, and found that I had missed an awful lot of issues that 
I needed to talk about. So I’m certainly glad to be able to join in 
again today and fill in the some of the gaps, some of the areas 
that I missed over the last week and a half or two weeks when 
talking about the confidence or lack of confidence in this 
government. And we certainly see it over and over again. 
 
And I think personally if there was ever a telling sign that I 
don’t have confidence in this government or I believe most of 
the Assembly doesn’t have confidence was in this past 
75-minute debate when, for example, one of the members, 
Saskatoon Fairview, was asked a question. And where he 
wanted to start to answer the question was back in the ’80s. 
That’s 26 years ago, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 

This government has been in power for 16 years. You would 
think where you would start to answer a question after you’ve 
been in power for 16 years is, this is what we have done in the 
time that we have been in government. But instead what they do 
is they talk about what everybody else has done and all the 
problems that everybody else have caused for their government. 
And they don’t address what they have done, or the problem is, 
what they haven’t done. And that’s the bigger issue. And for 
that very reason, the issue around what they haven’t done are 
the reasons why we base our non-confidence motion in this 
government. 
 
It’ll be very interesting, Madam Deputy Speaker, when this 
motion comes to the floor to be voted on. I’m sure if members 
on that side of the House were to vote with their heart as 
opposed to being whipped to vote, as far as a Whip vote, many 
of them would say that yes, you know, over the 16 years we 
haven’t maybe served this province as well as we should have. 
And in particularly in the last couple years there have been 
some real major shortfalls in our government and in the way we 
have governed this province. 
 
When we talk about lack of confidence, I wanted to make sure 
that I had it right, so I looked at the Oxford Dictionary to find 
out what the definition of confidence is, and why we wouldn’t 
have it or many other people wouldn’t have it in this 
government. It talks about firm trust. 
 
Does a person have firm trust in this NDP government? And it 
certainly isn’t the case. We heard it again today in many 
situations, but I can just talk about in health care whether 
people trust this government and what they say, if they have a 
firm trust in what the minister is saying regarding the health 
care system. And I truly believe most people in this province 
don’t because what happens is, when the minister stands in the 
House and denies any of the reports that have come forward, 
saying they’re not accurate; they haven’t collected the data 
properly . . . But what those reports tell us is what people are 
facing on the streets and in their homes about health care, that 
in certain areas there is a hugely long waiting list, hugely long 
waits, and that certainly doesn’t . . . When they look at the word 
confident, do they have firm trust in this government to deliver 
health care in this province? Absolutely not. 
 
[12:30] 
 
A sense of self-reliance is also, you know, a term or a definition 
of confidence, and I don’t think people in this province, again, 
don’t feel that . . . yes, they don’t feel that they can rely on 
them. The government itself, I definitely, I think many of those 
members feel they have confidence within themselves. They 
feel that they are running a great program within the province. 
They’re running, you know, a strong government. 
 
But when you talk to the people of this province, over and over 
again when I’m out in the constituency of Indian 
Head-Milestone — which I’m in almost everyday, last night in 
Balgonie — and you talk to a number of people it is almost, 
without a person, the first question comes up is, when is the 
next election? I mean the member from Arm River certainly 
made that point at the end of the 75-minute debate that there’s 
certainly people around the province are asking when is the 
next election because people are looking to change the 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 645 

government. And why people look to change a government is 
because they don’t have confidence in a government. 
 
So I believe our motion is worded correctly. And I believe that 
. . . I would think that the majority of the members in this House 
would feel that they do not have confidence in the way this 
Premier and the way this government are running the affairs of 
this province. 
 
I want to talk a little bit more about health care to begin with, 
and then we’ll go on to some other subjects that deal with 
confidence and why people I feel don’t have confidence in this 
government. But I think if it was ever more telling, it’s in health 
care, and maybe because it’s the area I seem to be dealing with 
more often than not, with questions, is around the issue of 
health care. 
 
And the latest report that came out talking about the Wait Time 
Alliance interim report card, in other words, it’s not the final 
report card. And that’s certainly what the minister said today in 
the House, that this is only partial way through the time period 
that they have to implement the benchmarks that the Health 
ministers agreed on in 2004. So it’s an interim report. 
 
And I look at the report card . . . If we look at it as a normal 
report card, if we look at it as a normal report card, we’re not 
doing very well. I certainly know — we have two sons; one’s in 
elementary and one’s in high school, grade nine and grade 
seven — that if they were to bring a report card home like this, 
what would we say? I mean if our kids brought a report card 
home that had out of five subjects, two incompletes, one failure, 
one D, and one A, we wouldn’t be very happy. We wouldn’t be 
very happy with the performance of our kids if that’s the type of 
report card our kids brought home. 
 
Now the government can have this report card presented about 
them. And I truly believe, I truly believe that because of the 
report card this government has been given through the Wait 
Time Alliance — this report card — people of the province will 
say that is a terribly poor performance. When you have, out of 
five subjects — let’s call it a semester of five subjects — and 
you have two incomplete marks, you have one A, and a D, and 
an F on five priority areas, how could the people of this 
province have a confidence that this government is delivering 
health care properly? It doesn’t matter whether it’s in . . . 
 
I mean, I’ll certainly give the government credit where credit is 
due. And the minister talked about this in question period. In 
question period, he kind of shunned the report. He didn’t think 
the report was accurate because it didn’t collect the proper data. 
It didn’t collect the proper data. But at the end of question 
period in his last answer, he did state that getting an A in 
cardiac care was a good thing. And it is an absolutely good 
thing. 
 
So if you’re going to accept an A in cardiac care, because we 
are doing fairly well in that area, you have to then accept the 
premise that we had an F in joint replacement. And we had a D 
in sight restoration and cataract surgery. If you are going to 
accept the A, you need to be able to accept the F and the D and 
the two incompletes. You can’t have it both ways. You can’t 
say that the data is incorrect, but we’ll accept the A, but the data 
is incorrect, and we’ll reject the rest. 

And I would say that the report card is pretty close to what we 
hear as opposition MLAs [Member of the Legislative 
Assembly], and I’m sure the minister will hear many of the 
same concerns come to his office. I can tell you in our office we 
receive an awful lot of health care concerns. 
 
And I can honestly say, do we receive a lot of cardiac care cases 
that they haven’t had proper care within the system? And that’s 
very seldom that we would receive any of those cases. We do 
receive some regarding wait times for angioplasties and issues 
like that. But overall we normally receive very little concern 
about cardiac care in the province. 
 
I think that is very reflective in this report card. In the report 
card it shows that we receive an A in that area. And I’ll give the 
government credit where credit is due. If you look at the rest of 
the provinces, all but about three provinces out of ten received 
an A. So it’s being handled very well across Canada. 
 
But where we really fall behind the rest of Canada behind the 
rest of the provinces is in joint replacement. And again that 
would be reflective in the calls that we receive in our offices. I 
would say that on a regular basis I receive phone calls from 
people that have been waiting for a knee replacement, that are 
waiting years and years and years. 
 
We had in fact in my own family, extended family, whether it’s 
my father-in-law or brother-in-law, they’ve both had both knees 
replaced. That’s four knees in two people. But the amount of 
time that they had to wait was absolutely amazing and 
especially for my brother-in-law who had to wait years and 
years. In fact to see the deterioration that he went through in the 
time that he had to wait . . . he would be about, I think he would 
be about 50 years old, 45 to 50 years old, and he’s received both 
knee replacements now. But literally he was on crutches at 47 
years old for a year. He could not get around, and he was on 
crutches for a year because of the excruciatingly long wait and 
the excruciating pain that he had to suffer. It was truly amazing 
that in our health care system in Saskatchewan that somebody 
would have to wait that long. 
 
I remember also one case that came to the legislature — well 
actually it was intersessionally just prior to myself becoming 
the Health critic — and his name was Everett Ritzco. And he 
had to have a hip replacement, and it had been for quite a long 
time he’d been waiting and waiting and waiting. 
 
And his health was deteriorating so much so that he was having 
trouble living on his own. In fact if something didn’t change, he 
was going to have to move from his apartment, he would have 
to give up the work that he was working at — I believe he was a 
commissionaire at the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police], I could be wrong — give up that work because he just 
simply couldn’t get around anymore. 
 
And winter was setting in which was even worse for the pain. 
So he needed to, he needed to get something done. He was 
fortunate enough to have a brother that lived in Toronto that 
knew an orthopaedic surgeon. Everett then flew to Toronto and 
had the surgery done within two weeks. He had been waiting 
for years here in Saskatchewan and within two weeks he was 
able to get the surgery done in Toronto. And it changed his 
whole outlook on life. He was able to then recuperate and start 



646 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

exercising again and certainly his quality of life had improved. 
 
And I would say it would be . . . Well the member from Wood 
River mentions about two-tier health care system, and that’s 
truly what it was in this situation. Everett had the money to be 
able to travel out of the province to receive health care which he 
couldn’t receive here in Saskatchewan. And we’re not 
necessarily arguing with the fact that, you know, travel 
expenses should be covered by the patient. 
 
The point being is that he couldn’t receive health care here, and 
the only way that he could receive health care in a timely 
manner was spending his own money by travelling to Toronto 
to get that done. You know, Everett is certainly. . . I don’t know 
him real well but I’m sure he’s managed his affairs very well. 
He had saved up some money and he was able to do that. 
 
There are some people that haven’t been as fortunate, many 
people that haven’t been as fortunate and are left lingering on 
waiting lists — the longest waiting lists in Canada. And as a 
result of that, that’s why we see in this report card that we’re 
rated as an F, which would be one thing if other provinces were 
in the same area. If other provinces out of the 10 provinces that 
are cited here, if other provinces had Fs, then we would say, it’s 
a national problem; every province is having the same. But it 
isn’t that case. 
 
You know, you can look at Newfoundland where they rate an A 
in joint replacements. You can look at Quebec which receives 
an A in joint replacements, Alberta a B, British Columbia a C. 
And no doubt they would like to be higher. But the only 
province in Canada, the only province in Canada that received 
an F was Saskatchewan . . . [inaudible interjection] . . . Yes. 
Newfoundland — even Newfoundland — they received an A. 
Well I mean, every province in Canada beat us actually because 
every province had a higher mark. 
 
And I just know, I just know that, you know, if I look at our 
kids bringing home a report card and there was an F on it, there 
would have to be some immediate work done, some of the 
extracurricular activities that they would be involved in would 
be taken away. 
 
Now I know myself, when I was in school, I would have never 
brought an F on my report card home. Maybe that report card 
wouldn’t have got home, but I can say that I don’t think my 
parents ever saw an F on a report card. That wasn’t meaning 
that I didn’t get an F on a report card, but they didn’t see that 
report card. 
 
But it really is an indictment; it is an indictment on this 
government. And you know, I think we could even, we could 
even understand that if . . . You know, again I’ll use our kids. If 
they have trouble in a subject . . . You know, for me when I was 
going to school, I had trouble in the odd subject, you know. I 
wasn’t the best reader or writer, and you can probably tell by 
my speeches. Not too many of them are written out because I’d 
have trouble reading them. But I always had a little trouble in 
that area. But certainly there is other areas that I did better in, 
and so my average in school was respectable. It certainly wasn’t 
as good as some of my classmates, for sure, but it was 
respectable. 
 

But when you look at the report card overall of the government 
in health care, and you look at two incompletes, two D’s, an F, 
and an A, that isn’t having trouble in one area and doing very 
well in all the rest. That’s having trouble in most areas and 
doing very well in one. And that’s where the concern comes in. 
 
I know one of our sons, his report card just came home and he 
wasn’t doing very good in French. And so I thought well maybe 
I should help him, but then I thought that won’t help his mark 
very well. So he was having trouble in French. And so, I mean, 
yes, we’re going to do some work on that. But if you look at the 
rest of his report card, he really does take after his mother 
because the report card is really quite good.  
 
But he did well in most things and has trouble in one. And 
that’s one area that we can work on and we can understand that. 
But when you have trouble in most areas and only have one 
good mark, you have to look at your whole program or what 
you’re doing. 
 
And that’s certainly what we’ve been calling on this 
government to do for a very, very long time, is to start looking 
at the whole health care system. We’ve talked for many, many 
years. And the minister who made fun of me the other day, 
whether I said five years that we’ve been talking about 
recruitment of nurses or eight years, and you know what? You 
can pick however many years you want. You can pick whatever 
year. I mean I’ve only been here for seven years. You can pick 
whichever year you want. We have been talking about the issue 
of recruitment and retention of nurses and doctors, health care 
professionals of all sorts because what deals with waiting lists 
are having the professionals in place. 
 
You know Alberta, if I go back to this report card again . . . I 
seem to be stuck up on this report card here. If I go back to this 
report card again and I look at Alberta, they received a B. And 
if you look back a couple, a year ago, or a year-and-a-half ago, 
they made a consolidated effort to work on joint replacement. 
They had a pilot project where they put, yes, more money, but 
they targeted a lot of their management and health care 
professionals to deal with the backlog on joint replacement. 
And as a result, they ended up with a B. 
 
So you can raise your marks, that’s for sure. And what we’ve 
been telling the government, in order to raise the marks for our 
health care report card, we need to take some certain steps. And 
those steps are increasing the number of health care 
professionals. 
 
We had a debate in this House during question period the other 
day about endocrinologists and how many endocrinologists we 
had in the province. And there was some concern that our 
numbers were wrong or we were using numbers that were 
fictitious. But the numbers that we were using came right out of 
an advisory committee that was set up by the government. 
Those weren’t the numbers . . . Because frankly I don’t know 
how many endocrinologists we need. I don’t know how many 
pediatric endocrinologists and I don’t know how many 
endocrinologists for adults that we need. I don’t know. But the 
two professional groups, the advisory committee and the Royal 
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, stated that we 
needed anywhere from eight to twelve endocrinologists to deal 
with the issue. 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 647 

[12:45] 
 
Well it was interesting because we got out into the rotunda and 
we got into a bit of a discussion back and forth. Do we have one 
in Saskatoon? Or do we have two or should we have three? But 
regardless of what the number we were arguing — whether it’s 
two or three or one — it’s a long ways from eight to twelve. So 
the point being is that we can argue whether we’ve got one or 
two or three. Then what we really need to deal with in this case, 
the issue of diabetes, is more health care professionals, more 
endocrinologists. 
 
The same discussion happened when we talked about 
oncologists and how many oncologists we had and the fact that 
we needed more. The reason we need more is we’ve got the 
longest waiting list in Canada — three months to see . . . for 
first visit to an oncologist, which is three times the national 
average. And so we raised that issue. And what we were saying 
is, we need to have more oncologists on staff in the province. 
 
And I will agree totally; they’re tough to recruit. They’re very 
tough to recruit. And so it’s . . . I mean retention is even that 
more important but what we need . . . And so we got into a 
discussion and I forget — I think it was in Saskatoon — 
whether we had three or four. I forget the numbers and the 
numbers may not be accurate, whether it’s three or four or 
whatever. And I said, well it should be four. And the minister 
said, no it should be three. The point being, what would be 
wrong if we had an extra one? What would be wrong if we had 
an extra oncologist so that we could start bringing the numbers 
down? 
 
Because what he was arguing was in order to get back to a 
status quo where we are, we need three. And I happened to say 
four, so one more. And what that one more oncologist would’ve 
done was start bringing down the wait for first visit to 
oncologists. And I certainly know it’s expensive and I know it’s 
tough to recruit. They’re tough to recruit. But the part being is 
that if we want to have what they . . . What the government has 
talked about in every campaign, what the government has 
talked about in every campaign is having the best health care 
system in Canada. 
 
And it certainly is kind of their golden goose. I mean that’s the 
one . . . That’s their claim to fame. That’s what they’ve always 
hung their hat on is the health care system in Saskatchewan. 
Because of course, because of course their idol, Tommy 
Douglas, you know is known across Canada as implementing 
the program. And so that’s the area that they think is most 
important. So every campaign, they’ll campaign on the fact that 
we have the best health care system in Canada. 
 
But the facts simply don’t always prove it out. The facts don’t 
prove it out. The report cards don’t prove it out. There are many 
examples unfortunately that come to us. And the minister will 
say how many procedures we do each day and over the year. 
And there are many, many procedures that are done. 
 
But what is the true test of the system is how many people are 
falling through the cracks — how many people aren’t getting 
the health care that this government expects them to have, that 
we expect them to have, that the people of Saskatchewan expect 
to have. And that’s a true test. And I believe, I truly believe that 

we have more people fall through the cracks here in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
And we see them come to this Assembly and plead their case — 
whether it’s Crystal Bonderud, whether it’s Terry Rak, whether 
it’s Bob Loeppky, those issues on Avastin, Crystal Bonderud on 
misdiagnosis and then being covered when her and her husband 
went down to the Mayo Clinic in the States, whether it’s baby 
Paige, the list goes on. 
 
Whether it’s Emily Morley from up north who, you know, was 
one of these cases that had to wait three months to see an 
oncologist for the first time. The family came and complained. 
The date was moved up. Unfortunately after the date was 
moved up, they saw how serious the cancer was and how it had 
spread. But the point being is how they had peace of mind after 
that. They knew where they stood. And they made 
arrangements. And they dealt with the cards that were dealt. 
They played with the cards that were dealt to them. 
 
The unfortunate part was had things not changed and had that 
appointment not been sped up, they would have been spending 
three months not knowing what the prognosis was. And that’s 
very tough for a family to deal with. You’re sitting there for 
three months. No doubt her health would have been 
deteriorating. They would have been wondering, what can we 
be doing to save our mom or, you know, or grandmother or 
whoever it is. What can we be doing? But until they got the 
diagnosis, they didn’t know. 
 
And by coming to the Assembly and pleading their case, it was 
moved ahead and within two weeks they had the diagnosis. And 
then they were able to deal with the situation in front of them. 
And I think that’s only fair and humane for a family to know 
what the issue will be and how to deal with it. 
 
So there are many, many situations where what we do need is 
more health care professionals. I’ve talked about 
endocrinologists. I’ve talked about oncologists. And there are 
many other specialty areas I could talk about. 
 
There’s also the area of nursing and how we’ve talked for 
many, many years — and you can pick the year again — that 
we need to start recruiting and retaining more nurses. I have a 
letter here that I’d just like to read into the record while I can, 
that was sent to the Leader of the Opposition. And we’ve talked 
to the lady that wrote this letter and she said it was perfectly 
fine if we used it in the Assembly. So I’d just like to . . . I guess 
here goes. We’ll see how my reading skills are now. This is the 
area that I . . . We’ll see how my reading skills are as I read this 
letter into the record. 
 

I’m writing to you in regards to the nursing shortage in 
Saskatchewan. My son, who is originally from 
Saskatchewan, and his wife has recently decided to move 
back to Saskatchewan from Calgary. 
 

That’s a good story. 
 
He works in broadcasting and has taken a job in 
Rosetown. My daughter in law is a Registered Nurse. She 
has been nursing in Alberta for over a year now. The day 
that Ryan received notice that he had his job was the day 



648 Saskatchewan Hansard November 30, 2006 

[that] the NDP announced the incentive program to bring 
in nurses. That was great news until Melanie went to 
transfer her licence over to Saskatchewan. I am not sure if 
you are aware of the red tape that you have to go through 
to do this. I personally thought it would be a simple 
transfer over since she is a qualified Registered Nurse in 
Alberta. Saskatchewan has asked for marks that she does 
not have access to, so that had to be sent from Edmonton, 
then a letter was sent from her current employer, all [of] 
her pay stubs were . . . sent in . . . [and all] other . . . 
[document]. She has done all [of] this a month ago. Last 
week she phoned to see what was holding things up and 
they told her that they wanted her hours after she deducted 
her meal time and coffee break time. If my son had not 
taken a job in Saskatchewan, with all this hassle she would 
have never come here to nurse, no matter what the 
incentives were. 

 
So I guess the point being, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that it’s one 
thing to say that you’re short of nurses. It’s another thing to 
welcome them here. Yes, you have to make sure their 
credentials are right, but sometimes there is so much red tape — 
and in this case there is so much red tape — that people are 
frustrated and they say, that’s enough, and they decide to look 
for work in other places. 
 
It goes on to say that: 
 

Maybe if Saskatchewan wants to bring in more nurses then 
I think the NDP needs a wakeup call, because all [of] their 
incentive programs are not enough incentive for nurses 
from other provinces to go through this hassle. As my 
daughter in law asks, I am an RN in Alberta why am I not 
good enough to be an RN in Saskatchewan. I guess that is 
a question for the NDP. 
 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Why she wouldn’t be good enough to be an 
RN in Saskatchewan without having to go through all this red 
tape. 
 
Last Friday I met with a physician in Indian Head who was a 
South African physician who had been in the province for about 
three or four years and the story was virtually the same as what 
this lady is describing her daughter-in-law had to go through. 
The story is virtually the same. 
 
The fact that he had to go, and some of the red tape . . . And he 
wasn’t knocking the fact that he had to meet standards in 
Saskatchewan before he was licensed. That wasn’t the issue. 
The issue was around a lot of other issues that between the 
Department of Health, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, 
and the health authorities had asked him. 
 
He had said that many of his friends had been to Canada and 
had gone back to South Africa because after three or four years 
they were frustrated with the system that they had to go through 
here. He said, I don’t believe that it could be that difficult. And 
so that’s why he came. And he’s spent three years here now, 
and honestly I think he’s looking at other options of maybe 
moving back to South Africa. And it’s sad because those are the 
type of people we need in our province. 

We have a higher reliance on foreign-trained doctors than any 
other province in Saskatchewan. And if you’re in that position, 
you better not be chasing them out. And I know I’ve heard from 
some people saying, well the South African doctors, they just 
come here for a couple of years and then they leave. As if they 
want to leave. But that isn’t always the case. 
 
I mentioned to this doctor, has anybody talked to you if you 
were to leave or the friends that you’ve had that have practised 
in Saskatchewan that have left, has anybody asked them what 
the problems are and why they’re leaving? And not one person, 
not one of these physicians that has been so frustrated with the 
system, that has left, has been asked why they left. 
 
There’s reasons why these physicians are leaving. You know, 
they’ve come here to set up a new life and a new practice, and 
after three or four years they’re frustrated. Does anybody know 
what those frustrations are? Does anybody in the department 
know what those frustrations are? I mean we hear on a daily 
basis, whether it’s in Bengough, Canora, Kamsack, Preeceville; 
whether it’s in Spiritwood, Vanguard, Broadview, Arcola — all 
over — they’re really short of doctors. 
 
And you know, in Broadview it was interesting to see in 
Broadview on the news the other day, they talked about putting 
in place nurse practitioners and how important that is. And we 
would agree totally that nurse practitioners will play a very, 
very important role in our health care system. But they will not, 
they will not replace a practising physician and that’s what we 
need in our province. 
 
And every one of these facilities can maybe get by for a short 
time with a nurse practitioner, like they’re going to do in 
Broadview with two nurse practitioners. But it is dealing . . . it 
is trying to put a bandage over a much bigger injury. The bigger 
injury is the fact that we just don’t have enough practising 
physicians to cover the spots that we need in rural 
Saskatchewan. And because of that we need to do extra due 
diligence when we are recruiting physicians from other 
countries, but when physicians are here, that we listen to the 
concerns that they have. 
 
If they have concerns, let’s listen to them. I know that we can’t 
maybe cater to every concern. If it’s a concern with the CAPE 
[clinicians’ assessment and professional enhancement] exam, 
maybe we need to look at that, but there needs to be some sort 
of benchmark that they measure up to. We have absolutely no 
argument with that and neither do physicians. But when they 
have other problems that aren’t listened to and they finally get 
frustrated and leave this province, we need to make sure we 
know what that is and take corrective measures, Mr. Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
Well that’s just my first start on health care. I had a whole lot of 
other issues that I wanted to talk about. And what I really 
wanted to talk . . . Some of the other issues I wanted to talk 
about other than health care is why people don’t have 
confidence in this government, are situations that . . . I was just 
reading in a newspaper article about the, and I quote here, 
“Calvert says jobs abound.” And what it is, is a bit of a 
summary of his speech last night in Saskatoon which I think 
you might be very aware of. 
 



November 30, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 649 

And I thought it was very interesting when he was talking about 
youth and keeping youth in Saskatchewan, opportunities for 
youth. Young families abound in Saskatchewan; he goes on 
about that. But when we’re talking about youth retention, he 
goes, “I could not have said, when I became premier of this 
great province (five years ago), in complete confidence to a 
young person, ‘Your future can be here.’” 
 
He goes on to say, well today now that future is here. But I 
think that’s a very telling sign that if the Premier of this 
province when he took over from 10 years of NDP government, 
could not say to a young person, could not look that young 
person in the face and say with confidence that, your future is 
here in Saskatchewan, I believe that’s a very telling sign of this 
government. And I believe that’s a very telling sign as to why 
we’ve lost 17,000 people in the last two years because people 
will read off of whether the Premier has confidence in this 
province, whether he has confidence in the youth working in 
this province. If he doesn’t, people read off of that and start 
making exit strategies. And that’s exactly what has happened in 
this province. 
 
Now the Premier’s saying, we’ve got lots and lots of jobs. But 
it’s too late. We’ve lost a generation. We’re losing a generation 
of youth. We have the highest out-migration of any province 
because this Premier has finally admitted that he couldn’t look 
somebody in the eye three years ago, and says he didn’t have 
confidence that their future would be in Saskatchewan. I think 
that’s a stinging indictment of this Premier and the whole 
attitude of this government. And that is exactly why young 
people in this province, older people in this province, do not 
have confidence in this province because the very Premier of 
this province didn’t have confidence either. 
 
The only reason why jobs are abounding now is because we 
have seen a real spike in commodity prices in oil and gas and 
there’s jobs surrounding that. But what has happened is this 
government and this Premier have set up a climate in this 
province . . . and not the climate that’s out there today because 
that’s a little harsh, but a harsh climate in this province for 
people to stay. And they look for options and other provinces to 
go. 
 
And, you know, they’ll say, well you guys are all . . . you’re so 
pessimistic. I don’t want to be pessimistic. I would be so 
optimistic if those 17,000 people in the last two years stayed in 
Saskatchewan and we increased our population by 17,000 more 
people. That would give me confidence. That’s why I would 
then support a government that could say they’ve done that. But 
this government cannot because the Premier himself couldn’t 
have confidence in this province when we needed confidence in 
this province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So I tell you that I have absolutely no problem standing in my 
place and voting against . . . voting for the motion that shows 
that there is no confidence in this government, Mr. Speaker. 
And so I will be looking forward to the day . . . 
 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Prebble): — I apologize to the hon. 
member but the time is now 1 o’clock, hon. members, and I 
declare the House to be adjourned for the day. We will come 
together again at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, so the House stands 
adjourned until then. 

[The Assembly adjourned at 13:01.]
