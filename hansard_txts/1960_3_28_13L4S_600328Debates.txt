On the Orders of the Day 

 

EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY 

 

Premier Douglas:  Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you and all members of the House would want to 

collectively express our deep sympathy for the member of Athabaska (Mr. Harrop) whose mother 

passed away over the weekend. His mother, as many members know, had a very serious accident some 

time ago, and recovered, but more recently has been in ill health and passed away this past weekend. I 

am sure all members in all parts of the House would like through you, sir, to express to the hon. member 

from Athabaska, and to all the relatives, our deepest sympathy in this time of bereavement. 

 

CONGRATULATIONS TO CANADIAN WOMEN’S CURLING CHAMPIONS 

 

Mr. A.T. Stone (Saskatoon City):  Mr. Speaker, before the orders of the day are proceeded with, I 

would like to mention that although we all realize we have the best male curlers here in the province, it 

is only right that we should recognize, too, that we have some very good curlers amongst the females. 

Miss Joyce McKee rink, after winning the Western Canada Title, were invited east, and beat the eastern 

team for the Canadian Championship. I am sure the members will join with me in congratulating this 

rink for bringing the honours to this fair province of ours. 

 

Assembly in Committee of Supply until adjournment. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 10:00 o’clock p.m. without question put.
