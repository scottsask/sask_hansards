MR. R. J. ROMANOW (Attorney General): — Mr. Speaker, I’m going to propose an amendment 
which will bring this question into line with the way it’s been asked in previous years. In 1976 and 1977 
and other years when this form of question has taken place in the legislature, we produced amendments 
which gave the names of all reports and studies commissioned by the department, (in this case the 
Department of Health) of external consultants during the period of March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980 — 
the names of these consultants and the final costs. This is information which has been tendered in the 
past and that’s been wording the House has adopted. Therefore, I move, seconded by the Provincial 
Secretary (Mr. Cowley) that all the words after ‘showing’ be deleted, and the following substituted 
therefor: 
 

The names of all reports and studies commissioned by the Department of Health to external 
consultants during the period March 1,1979 to March 25, 1980; (2) the names of these consultants 
and the final costs. 



 
March 25, 1980 
 

 
1068 

And may I just say, Mr. Speaker, again to highlight the difficulty with the way the question is worded 
unamended — any consultants or consulting firms. Clearly the government could give any kind of 
interpretation and the proposed amendment does the job for the opposition. 
 
Amendment agreed. 
 
Motion as amended agreed.

the contract. (b) In each instance, whether the contract was advertised, or awarded without 
advertising.

Return No. 156 
 
MR. E.A. BERNTSON (Leader of the Opposition) moved, seconded by the member for Indian 
Head-Wolseley (Mr. Taylor) that an order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 156 showing: 
 

Whether since March 1, 1979, any consultants or consulting firms have been awarded a contract 
with the Celebrate Saskatchewan (a) If so, the nature of the contract or contracts, the name and 
address of each consultant or consulting firm, the value of the contract, and the purpose of the 
contract. (b) In each instance, whether the contract was advertised, or awarded without advertising. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the Provincial Secretary (Mr. Cowley) that all 
the words after ‘showing’ be deleted and the following substituted therefor: 
 

(1) The names of all reports and studies commissioned by the Celebrate Saskatchewan to external 
consultants during the period of March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980; (2) the names of these 
consultations and the final cost. 

 
May I say, Mr. Speaker, before I take my chair that Celebrate Saskatchewan is doing an excellent job. If 
they have consulted external consultants during this period, to advise them on Celebrate ’80 it would 
have been money well spent for the functions of the province of Saskatchewan. The hon. member says 
that he is thinking of hiring him. I want to tell the hon. member he needs to hire them after this session 
takes place. 
 
This is a very worth-while project, I am sure all members would agree and, therefore, with your 
permission I would move, seconded by the Provincial Secretary (Mr. Cowley), the amendment. 
 
Amendment agreed. 
 
Motion as amended agreed. 
 

Return No. 157 
 
MR. E.A. BERNTSON (Leader of the Opposition) moved, seconded by the member for Indian 
Head-Wolseley (Mr. Taylor) that an order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 157 showing: 
 

Whether since March 1, 1979, any consultants or consulting firms have been awarded a contract 
with the Board of Revenue Commissioners. (a) If so, the nature of the contract or contracts, the name 
and address of each consultant or consulting firm, the value of the contract, and the purpose of 



 
March 25, 1980 

 

 
1075 

the contract. (b) In each instance, whether the contract was advertised, or awarded without 
advertising. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the Provincial Secretary (Mr. Cowley) that all 
the words after ‘showing’ be deleted and the following substituted therefor: 
 

The names of all reports and studies commissioned by the Board of Revenue Commissioners, 
through external consultants, during the period of March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980, the names of 
these consultations and the final costs. 

 
HON. E. L. COWLEY (Provincial Secretary): — Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a couple of 
comments here. I think this question, to me, typifies — I don’t know what about the opposition — but 
the board of revenue commissioners is hardly the most important agency of the government. It does 
have an important function. It meets, I would guess, maybe two or three times a year at the very most. It 
is the local government board and as I recall from my days in fiancé, it rules once in a while, maybe two 
or three times a year, if that, on appeals on the E&H tax and other things. 
 
I think this whole afternoon, Mr. Speaker, should be a lesson to somebody in whatever the opposition is 
trying to do. There are 17 or 18 pages of these questions which could have very easily, by any member 
with half a brain — in fact, he wouldn’t have needed that much — been put into one question and saved 
us at least two or three hours of this House’s time. However, I think if the member Saskatchewan wish 
to ask their question sin this form, we certainly will comply with it as we have no other choice. My 
guess is, if I can take a look at these questions — that by the time we total up the cost of answering all 
the questions on the order paper, it will be several hundred thousand dollars may approach $1 million. 
 
Amendment agreed. 
 
Motion as amended agreed. 
 

Return No. 158 
 
MR. E.A. BERNTSON (Leader of the Opposition) moved, seconded by the member for Indian 
Head-Wolseley (Mr. Taylor) that an order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 158 showing: 
 

Whether since March 1, 1979, any consultants or consulting firms have been awarded a contract 
with the board of examiners. (a) If so, the nature of the contract or contracts, the name and address of 
each consultant or consulting firm, the value of the contract, and the purpose of the contract. (b) In 
each instance, whether the contract was advertised, or awarded without advertising. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, on this one I shall echo the words of the Provincial Secretary, but I 
was tempted to ask the hon. member for Cannington for a brief explanation of what the board of 
examiners is and what it does, and I am sure that we would get the relevance of that question. But I shall 
refrain from asking such a prerogative question and merely move my amendment, seconded by the 
Provincial Secretary (Mr. Cowley), that all the words after ‘showing’ be deleted and the following 
substituted therefor: 



 
March 25, 1980 
 

 
1076 

(1) The names of all reports and studies commissioned by the board of examiners to external 
consultants during the period of March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980; (2) the names of these 
consultations and the final costs. 

 
Amendment agreed. 
 
Motion as amended agreed. 
 

Return No. 159 
 
MR. E.A. BERNTSON (Leader of the Opposition) moved, seconded by the member for Regina South 
(Mr. Rousseau) that an order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 159 showing: 
 

Whether since March 1, 1979, any consultants or consulting firms have been awarded a contract 
with the Attorney General’s department. (a) If so, the nature of the contract or contracts, the name 
and address of each consultant or consulting firm, the value of the contract, and the purpose of the 
contract. (b) In each instance, whether the contract was advertised, or awarded without advertising. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, again, I am going to make the same amendment. On this one I just 
want to say a little word about the kind of difficulty presented by the lack of precision by the questions 
being asked here. I don’t mean this to be a repetitive record. I don’t mean it to be in any aggressive 
sense, but the Attorney General’s department, for example, engages counsel, outside fee-for-service 
counsel to act as agent prosecutors out in the field. I don’t view them to be external consultants. I view 
them to be agents of the Attorney General. One could or might interpret that to be an external consultant. 
I am assuming there is no difficulty in that regard. You want the names of all reports and studies not of 
that kind of a category incorporated in the return, and in that regard that’s understood by everybody. I 
think with a great deal of work and a lot of effort we’ll probably be able to come up with some answers 
on this. So, therefore, Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the Hon. Provincial Secretary (Mr. Cowley) 
that all the words after ‘showing’ be deleted and the following substituted therefor: 
 

(1) The names of all reports and studies commissioned by the Attorney General’s department to 
external consultants during the period of March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980; (2) the names of these 
consultations and the final costs. 

 
Amendment agreed.

the contract. (b) In each instance, whether the contract was advertised, or awarded without 
advertising.

the words after ‘showing’ be deleted and the following substituted therefor: 
 

(1) the number of consultants or consulting firms who have been awarded contracts by the 
agricultural development corporation in the period of March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980; (2) the

MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, on this one again the atmosphere and the spirit of open government 
that we have displayed this afternoon and tonight, may I say is unparalleled probably in any legislature 
in Canada. Certainly, no Tory legislature would be this open. I want to show you how far we’re going in 
our openness, Mr. Speaker. We could say to this motion, unamended agreed, and give a nil answer 
because the question is directed to contracts of consulting, etc. with the potash corporation. So far as I 
know, Mr. Speaker, we don’t, the people of Saskatchewan, have such a thing as the potash corporation. I 
don’t know what potash corporation is referred to here, if any; but I have a hunch what the member 
means is the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, PCS. In the spirit of openness, notwithstanding what 
is really behind this, I’m going to tender this amendment, seconded by my colleague, the Provincial 
Secretary (Mr. Cowley) that all the words after ‘showing’ be deleted and the following substituted 
therefor: 
 

(1) The number of consultants or consulting firms who have been awarded contracts by the Potash 
Corporation of Saskatchewan. . . 

 
May I add here parenthetically, it would be a good idea if your question writers would check with us 
first and we will help to clear up the questions here. 
 

. . . in the period March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980; (2) the total value cost; (3) the number of 
consultants that are in province and out of province. 

 
Amendment agreed. 
 
Motion as amended agreed.

Motion as amended agreed. 
 

Return No. 31 
 
MR. D.G. TAYLOR (Indian Head-Wolseley) moved, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. 
Berntson) that an order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 31, showing: 
 

(1) The departments, Crown corporations, boards, commissions, or any other Government of 
Saskatchewan entity presently issuing charge cards to employees for any job-related expenses, 
including transportation, car rental, hotel, meals, etc. (2) In each case, the number of cards currently 
authorized, the name of the person holding the card, his or her position and the credit limit of the 
card. (3) The name of the company which issue each commercial card. (4) In each case, the name of 
the individual having authority to grant the issuance of such cards and to set policy for their use. (5) 
List the general government guidelines or regulations that govern the issuance and use of such cards. 
(6) (a) The total amount charged on such cards from March 1, 1979 to March 10, 1980; (b) The 
highest amount charged by a individual during this period and the name of the individual; (c) The 
name of the individuals whose were withdrawn, the reasons and the name of the individual asking 
for the withdrawal; (d) The number of cards ordered withdrawn. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, again, this is another small or large example. We’re going to 
answer the question; there has to be an amendment in order to make it somewhat manageable. But this is 
an example of the thing we’ve been trying to say all day today. The question is the departments, Crown 
corporations, boards, commissions, etc. issuing charge cards to employees on job related transportation, 
cars, 



 
March 25, 1980 
 

 
1082 

rental, etc. And down it goes in general guidelines and the like. 
 
Now, the two points I’d like to make here, Mr. Speaker, are the obvious ones, and they are that this job 
alone, if adopted, would be virtually impossible to comply with — virtually impossible! . . . (inaudible 
interjection) . . .Yes, yes. I don’t know how many cars there are in the government employ — we’ll find 
that out during estimates. But each one of them has — how many credit cards? 
 
AN HON. MEMBER: — Twenty or thirty. 
 
MR. ROMANOW: — Twenty or thirty credit cards. Out of . . . [inaudible interjection] . . . Oh no. 
Shame. Interesting to hear that — that you would deny our civil servants, when they’re travelling around 
the province of Saskatchewan, the access to that kind of an operation, according to your point of view 
. . . [inaudible interjection] . . . Just one. And if it were yours it would be Shell, not a co-op one. Would 
it be the co-op one? You table it. The hon. member says he has only one. Well, Mr. Speaker, it’s 
unbelievable it happened to be the hon. member for Indian Head-Wolseley who carries one around. The 
Shell credit card is the one he carries around I suppose. He wouldn’t carry a co-op credit card. He 
wouldn’t carry a Petro-Can credit card. That’s for sure, because those guys wanted to do away with 
Petro-Can. I don’t want to make a speech but I could be very, very tempted to make one. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very complicated question. What we’re going to do is make a small amendment 
which deletes part (c) of 6 of the question — the names of the individuals whose cards were withdrawn, 
the reasons they were withdrawn and the number of cards ordered withdrawn. The way this question is 
worded it would mean virtually anybody who quits has a credit card withdrawn from him or, when there 
is a switch in employment. Furthermore, this may or may not imply some form of a search of breaking 
of credit card guidelines. I don’t know if it does or not — virtually impossible. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I think what I have to propose here is a reasonable compromise for the information, 
although I must tell the House again, and I want to tell all members, this will take a tremendous amount 
of work to dig up the information. The proposed amendment will be that all the words after 
subparagraph 2 be deleted and the following substituted therefor: 
 

(2) the number of cards currently authorized; 
 

(3) the names of the companies that have issued credit cards to these entities; 
 

(4) the general guidelines or regulations that govern issuants and use of such cards; 
 

(5) the total amount paid to the issuing firms on such cards from March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980; 
 

(6) the highest amount charged to a credit card from March 1, 1979 to March 25, 1980, and the 
holder of that card. 

 
Now, I repeat, Mr. Speaker, when the totality of this uncovered, well I don’t want to say we’ll have to 
have a wheelbarrow to bring in the information because that may be a slight exaggeration but, there will 
be a lot of this. May I say, Mr. Speaker, the practice 



 
March 25, 1980 

 

 
1083 

here is one which has been established by the government now over many years — certainly before the 
beginning of this administration, and I don’t know, I suppose since the early ’60s. So it is an accepted 
practice used in governments, not only in Saskatchewan but outside. It’s going to be a massive job, but 
we’ll do it. It embraces the spectrum and that’s what we’ll do, but I simply want to pinpoint that its 
going to be a toughie 
 
MR. COWLEY: — A couple of comments here. I notice the member shaking his head when the Hon. 
Attorney General mentioned 20 or 30 credit cards, but in all government vehicles there are government 
credit cards. They aren’t plastic credit cards like Shell or whatever, but they could be used at any service 
station. You and the service station operator sign them. They are each individually a credit card and so 
taken literally, the way the question was asked, each and every one of those (each of which has a 
separate number) is a separate credit card issued not really to the individual because they are issued to 
the government vehicle. These are the kinds of problems you get into when you start dealing with this 
kind of a question, with respect to credit cards. So it wasn’t 20 or 30 plastic cards, the kind we think of 
but there are separate, individually numbered credit cards. 
 
The other comment I’d make is with respect to credit cards; anything charged on a government credit 
card has to be submitted by the employee in exactly the same way as though he had paid cash for it and 
got a receipt. There is every bit as much control on a credit as there is on the employees’ expenditures 
for which he claims reimbursement. And so, whether or not there is a credit card one could argue is 
irrelevent in terms of what the employee is doing, because the same mode of control is used for his own 
expenditures through cash as is used for the employees’ expenditures through a credit card. Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
MR. SPEAKER: — Will the member take a question? 
 
MR. COWLEY: — I’ll take a question. 
 
MR. KATZMAN (Rosthern): — Are you suggesting that the only credit card the government has is 
the booklet where you rip each one out, and that you have none of the plastic ones for some different 
company? 
 
MR. COWLEY: — I wasn’t suggesting that at all. I was talking about one kind of credit card. If we are 
going to answer for all the credit cards in government, each and every one of those would have to be 
listed as a separate credit card because that’s what they are legally. Each is a separate credit card. I’m 
not saying there aren’t other credit cards. 
 
Amendment agreed. 
 
Motion as amended agreed.

order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 502 showing: 
 

A detailed outline from the Department of the Environment on how the Government of 
Saskatchewan plans to dispose of all wastes resulting from uranium mining and refining in 
Saskatchewan. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Estevan asks, how can I amend this one? I 
must confess that it is not easy especially when you consider the original question. The original 
questions says, Mr. Speaker — get this — a detailed outline from the Department of the Environment on 
how the Government of Saskatchewan plans to dispose of all wastes resulting from uranium mining and 
refining in Saskatchewan; a detailed outline for what the Government of Saskatchewan says, or it is 
alleged, it says, is responsible for disposition of the wastes. 
 
Well it is difficult to amend the question, that kind of a question, with that all-embracing a field, but I 
think I have an amendment, Mr. Speaker. I have an amendment, after a great deal of thought on this, 
which should satisfy all the members opposite. 
 
I would like to move, seconded by the Provincial Secretary (Mr. Cowley) that all the words after the 
word ‘showing’ be deleted and the following substituted therefor: 
 

The manner in which the Government of Saskatchewan implements the most stringent regulation of 
uranium development anywhere in Canada, and outlines the measures for making licences public 
and regulating wastes generated by industry in uranium mining and milling operations. 

 
Amendment agreed. 
 
Motion as amended agreed.

Return No. 169 
 
MR. J.W.A. GARNER (Wilkie) moved, seconded by the member for Bengough-Milestone (Mr. 
Pickering) that and order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 169 showing: 
 

All studies, surveys, questionnaires, correspondence, reports, memoranda, aide-memoires, 
recommendations, and any other documents of the Department of Health with regard to the consent 
of minors with respect to the health care act. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, I’m going to ask the members of the House to turn down this 
proposed Order No. 169. There are two reasons for my urging this. The first reason is perhaps in the area 
of trivia, although I don’t think so. It’s a valid point. So far as I know — I stand to be corrected here — 
we don’t have a health care act in the province of Saskatchewan. The question asks for studies and 
surveys, etc. with regard to health care act as it relates to minors. We don’t have one in the province of 
Saskatchewan, so even if we were inclined to answer it I guess we would answer nil because there is no 
health care act. 
 
But it doesn’t matter because the principle — and this is my second reason — for this order for return is 
one that asks for all studies, surveys, questionnaires, correspondence. All correspondence, Mr. Speaker, 
get this, including correspondence for or against people write to a minister or write to a department 
expressing their views! They would now have that correspondence revealed — reports, memoranda, 
aide-memoires — any kind of an aide-memoire that a minister would have made in the course of a 
conversation with an individual — recommendations, and any other documents (just in case they 
haven’t covered the waterfront) of the Department of Health with regard to the consent of minors with 
respect to the health care act which is nonexistent. I stand to be corrected and I apologize if that is the 
case. 
 
So I say, Mr. Speaker, that it’s imply a wrong principle to do this, to table it. We’ve never done this 
before. These are internal documents which are used by the government and the department in the 
formulation of policy. Not only that, but it’s so sweeping and so wide it would be dangerous and unwise 
for us to adopt the motion as proposed. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, I’m recommending defeat in item 209, proposed Return No. 169. 
 
MR. GARNER: — Mr. Speaker, I’ll withdraw that and work it up and bring it back in a different form. 
I would also like to withdraw the next one, number 210, Return No. 170, as well. 
 
Motions for Return Nos. 169 and 170 withdrawn. 
 

Return No. 171 
 
MR. G.S. MUIRHEAD (Arm River) moved, seconded by the member for Wilkie (Mr. Garner) that an 
order of the Assembly do issue for Return No. 171 showing: 
 

The name, department and position of every person who was not covered under the Saskatchewan 
Government Employees’ Association contract who received remuneration from the Government of 
Saskatchewan for services 



 
March 25, 1980 
 

 
1116 

rendered to the Government of Saskatchewan during the period beginning midnight November 15, 
1979 and ending at midnight December 4, 1979. 

 
MR. ROMANOW: — Mr. Speaker, I think by now it will be obvious to all members of this Assembly 
what’s been transpiring here all day and basically all sitting evening with respect to these motions for 
returns and proposed questions. The point I want to make is that these question are asked in areas of 
concern which will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the government to answer. I invite again the 
members of this Assembly to consider this question which is before us. The question says the member 
wants the name, department and position of every person who is not covered under the Saskatchewan 
Government Employees’ Association contract who received remuneration from the Government of 
Saskatchewan for services rendered during the period of November 15 to December 4, 1979. 
 
By the way, Mr. Speaker, I think we can notice that period is the period during which there was 
disruption and a cessation of work as a result of a dispute involving the Saskatchewan Government 
Employees’ Association and the public service commission. I’ll say a word or two about that in a 
moment. But even if we could answer this question, what this question gets at and what it would have us 
do is to list the names of all the people who are not covered by the SGEA contract who receive 
remuneration from the Government of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know if the framer of this question stopped for one moment to think of the 
consequences of what this question wanted to uncover, because if that individual had, somewhere in the 
back room of the Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party’s offices, he would have surely realized 
the answer would obligate the government to list here the names, departments and positions of all people 
who are temporary employees, or part-time employees who have not worked long enough to qualify as 
SGEA members — probably amounting into the hundreds — casual employees who are not covered by 
the contract, members of CUPE which is another union not covered by the SGEA contract but covered 
in a collective bargaining agreement with the government (I don’t know for sure, but my estimate is 
there would be probably 400 workers or more just for the CUPE bargaining units alone), out-of-scope 
employees, those who are not covered by any SGEA contract and so forth I don’t know how much time, 
how much effort would be involved to answer that, but I would predict without any fear of 
contradiction, Mr. Speaker, it would be an inordinately large amount of time and effort — extra effort, I 
remind the members of the House, at taxpayers’ expense — to table this kind of information. 
 
Why was it asked, Mr. Speaker? This brings me to my second point. Why was it asked when I think — 
and this is my second point — the obvious intent of this motion is to try to get at — I say it is the intent 
— those workers who during the course o the dispute with SGEA, saw fit to return to work during the 
period of the dispute November 15 to midnight, December 4, 1979. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that at 
the fall session of the legislature a question of this same nature was asked by the opposition, the PC 
opposition, and we were dealing with it at that particular time. I say there can be no other motivation 
behind such a question. 
 
The hon. member for Maple Creek says it’s ridiculous. If the answer is that there is another motivation 
for it, why is it that the dates are so particularly identified as between November 15 and December 4, 
1979? I ask you if there is such a discussion in the legislature here, to take judicial notice of the fact that 
this was the exact period of the dispute — what they want is those people who returned to work not 
covered by the 



 
March 25, 1980 

 

 
1117 

SGEA contract. I don’t think they realize that their net cast such a broad scope and caught so many other 
people such as CUPE and casuals and part-times and those who were not in SGEA membership because 
of the fact of the 30-day waiting period and so forth, even if we could answer it on that kind of a basis. 
But I say, Mr. Speaker, that what this really involves is an attempt to witch hunt, to witch hunt the 
number of people who took a position one way or the other during the course of the SGEA dispute. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I make no mistake about it. This is the second question of this nature which has been put 
forward by the PC caucus and they want to find out what the answers are and the names and the 
positions in the departments. What are they going to do with this information, Mr. Speaker? How are 
they going to handle it? Where will this information come out? What approach will the opposition take 
once this information is provided to them? I say, Mr. Speaker, that it is absolutely essential to keep these 
questions in proper perspective. 
 
I don’t think the Liberal opposition, if they had been in this legislature at this time (if I may say 
comparing from my experience) would have shown the lack of attention that this motion, this order for 
return, does — casting such a broad net and thereby gathering in the names of innocent people or a 
number of people who are not related at all to this issue. What other possible conceivable reason could 
there be for getting this information? I invite the hon. members sometime later on during the course of 
the debate to explain to this House what the conceivable reason and motivation would be. Why would he 
motivate this to November 15 and December 4, 1979? I say that the logical conclusion is that this is an 
attempt — pure, simple, blatant, bold-faced attempt to get at the information related to the people with 
respect to the SGEA dispute. 
 
I say, Mr. Speaker, that this is a very lamentable position to be taken by the opposition. I say, Mr. 
Speaker, that tonight if we assess all of the orders for return that we have now filed in this Assembly 
. . .We have gone through maybe about one-third of them, Mr. Speaker, there is another half to 
two-thirds yet to be tackled let alone those that are adjourned at the next private members’ day and 
probably the next private members’ day after that, given the contention of them. 
 
I say that all of this shows the highest degree of irresponsibility on the part of the opposition; because, 
Mr. Speaker, if one had taken this particular motion and done one’s homework with respect to the issues 
and the answers sought, you wouldn’t have these kinds of wide nets which indeed have been cast with 
the tremendous costs and expenses which will be attached to the taxpayers of the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
I think, Mr. Speaker, that the PC opposition has shown itself to be bankrupt of new ideas by this order 
for return. The PC opposition has proven itself to be bankrupt politically. Mr. Speaker, I would say the 
PC opposition has proven itself to be totally bankrupt — period — with respect to this session. And, Mr. 
Speaker, I think I’ve been around this Assembly — if I keep this up for a little while longer, I may end 
up being the dean. Oh, it’s the member who does all the talking from the seated position in the House, 
but from a standing position outside the House . . . Sometime I’d like to welcome him into a formal 
debate inside the House. It would be nice to know what allegations he makes in this House rather than 
standing up there outside the legislature and doing that. 
 
So I say to the hon. members opposite — to each and every one of them — they should be ashamed at 
the effort hat has been put forward in this regard.

1118 

Now I don’t know if I’d single out the hon. member for Arm River personally for this kind of a motion 
because I don’t think he knew what he signed when he submitted this order for return. I think some 
poison pen writer or researcher in the back of his office gave him, like everybody else, a whole series of 
these questions on the order paper. Mr. Speaker, they gave no thought to what they were asking. They 
did not want to give any time to the research of the operation. They simply said this was the case. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what are we hiding, the hon. members say. The hon. members who were in the House 
today and tonight and the press will know we have agreed to virtually all of these motions for return — 
all of them. 
 
AN HON. MEMBER: — With amendments. 
 
MR. ROMANOW: — Yes, with the amendments, necessary amendments for question which if we’d 
adopted as answered would have provided a nil answer, time after time after time. Amendments in order 
to make the questions proper for the PC caucus . . . (inaudible) . . . 
 
SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 
 
MR. ROMANOW: — That’s the kind of co-operation we give them. Mr. Speaker, the people of 
Saskatchewan want this PC opposition to elevate its sights away from these kinds of motions and 
questions. It’s high time to start talking policy. Mr. Speaker, the members of this Assembly want to 
know where the PCs stand on uranium; where they stand on right to work; where they stand on direct 
billing; where they stand on developments; where they stand on Crown corporations and not to go on 
witch-hunting with respect to the SGEA employees. It’s high time the PCs told us where they were. 
 
SOME HON. MEMBERS: — Hear, hear! 
 
MR. ROMANOW: — It’s high time Mr. Devine took charge of this runaway caucus which puts 
motions like this before us. Mr. Speaker, it’s high time there was a leader of the PC Party to look as this 
motion and say to the caucus, hold it boys, you’re misdirecting your efforts. It’ high time that situation 
be put in here. I say, Mr. Speaker, when you see the kind of leaderless, rudderless, directionless kind of 
approach by the PC caucus that indeed the taxpayers of Saskatchewan, and only the taxpayers of
