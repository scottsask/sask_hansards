INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Hon. Mr. McLaren: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and colleagues. I would like to advise that there are three 

representatives of the Professional Firefighters Association in the gallery today, Mr. Speaker, and through you 

and to the members of the legislature I would like to introduce them. These gentlemen are here today in 

connection with the appointment of a second 



 

December 19, 1984 

755 
 

representative from the professional fire fighters association to the advisory committee on curriculum for the 

fire college and outreach program. And it's a real pleasure for me to introduce the three gentlemen in the 

Speaker's gallery. 

 

I would ask them to stand as they're introduced: Mr. Lew Tolley of Prince Albert, who will be joining the 

advisory committee early in the new year; Eugene Fletcher, president of the professional fire fighters 

association; and Kenneth Deans, vice-president of the professional fire fighters association. 

 

As all members will know, the report of the special committee on fire prevention, tabled in the House on March 

23, 1984, recommended the establishment of a fire college to train both volunteer and professional fire-fighters. 

And to date the requirements for the training of volunteer fire-fighters have been developed. Work is now 

proceeding with the development of the requirements for professional fire-fighters. 

 

I'm pleased to report that the professional fire fighters association has offered assistance and support in the 

development of a program of fire-fighter training. And I know that it is the association's hope that we will have 

a fire college in operation in Saskatchewan in the not too distant future. 

 

So, I would ask that all my colleagues and members in the legislature please welcome them here today in the 

usual manner. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Engel: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On behalf of the opposition caucus and as vice-chairman of the special 

committee I would like to extend a welcome to the three of you here today. It was a pleasure meeting you when 

we were meeting with the groups around, and particularly congratulate Mr. Tolley for being willing to joining 

this advisory board. 

 

I'm sure that the co-operation that the fire-fighters have offered both to the committee, and the pressure they've 

put on to both the government and the former government to get a college established in Saskatchewan is, in a 

large part, due to the pressure you put on and the needs you've determined that we should do so. 

 

I congratulate you for the efforts you've done and thank you for your co-operation in the past, and welcome you 

here. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Sveinson: — Mr. Speaker, as a fellow member on the same standing committee, I welcome the three 

gentlemen to the House today, and continued success in your endeavours in fighting fires in Saskatchewan.

ANNOUNCEMENTS 

 

Wishes for a Happy Chanukah 
 
Mr. Katzman: — Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask the members of the House to join me in wishing the people of the 

Jewish faith in the province a Happy Chanukah. Today is the first day of Chanukah. It started last evening. 

There's a member of the press and myself of that faith, and to the rest of the people in the community, we wish 

them a happy Chanukah, and may they have a good time. 



 

December 19, 1984 

766 
 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I join with the member for Rosthern in wishing the citizens 

of Saskatchewan of the Jewish faith a happy Chanukah. Chanukah is, as we well know, a time when relatives 

and friends come together for special religious services and to exchange gifts, and a time of rededication to a 

family life and a joyous family occasion, having some similarities with the way Christmas is celebrated by 

members of the Christian faith. 

 

My colleague, my former colleague, the member for Melfort, Norm Vickar, used to be able to reply to this 

perhaps more appropriately than can I, but I'm happy to join with my colleague, the member for Rosthern, in 

expressing our felicitations to the citizens of Saskatchewan of the Jewish faith. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

ORAL QUESTIONS 

 

Problems at Rocanville Mine 

 

Mr. Birkbeck: — Mr. Deputy Speaker, I, unfortunately, have had to wait quite a long time this morning, rather 

this afternoon, to ask a very important question. I would like to direct a question to the minister responsible for 

the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. 

 

Now, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have been monitoring the problems at the Rocanville division of PCS for a 

considerable length of time with regard to water flow rates into that mine. They started out at 500 gallons per 

minute as of about November 18, 1984, and they have increased, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to 3,500 gallons per 

minute today. 

 

Mr. Minister, my concern is for the safety of the personnel there, the potential loss of jobs, and of course, Mr. 

Minister, the future operations of the mine. I wonder, Mr. Minister, could you give this House the assurance 

and, of course, myself the assurance that this problem is going to be brought under control in the very near 

future? 
 
Hon. Mr. Andrew: — Mr. Deputy Speaker, the situation at the Rocanville mine, I am advised, is constantly 

being monitored. I am assured by the officials from the potash corporation that there is no danger to the 

personnel in this situation. We are concerned that yesterday the brine inflow has markedly increased from 900 

gallons per minute to 3,500 gallons per minute. 
 
I am further advised that this brine is being pumped to the mined-out section of the mine. The pumping capacity 

is 4,000 gallons per minute with standby capacity of another 3,000 gallons per minute. The capacity in the 

mined-out section with bulkheads being put in will handle that capacity for a further six-week period. We have 

brought in the expertise — and I'm advised by the potash corporation, the best expertise they can find — to try 

to come to grips with this problem. It was their hope that it was under control and could put cement plugs into 

the brine leakage problem. 
 
I am further advised that should that fail, they are looking at alternative methods by which to plug the hole and 

pump cement into it. 
 
Mr. Birkbeck: — Mr. Speaker, I would just ask one supplementary. Mr. Minister, I wonder, could you give 

myself the assurance that if this problem is not brought under control within a week or 10 days, that you 

yourself will personally travel with myself and some of your officials and go to the mine site and visit directly 

with those people to see that everything possible is being done that should be done to correct that problem? 
 
Hon. Mr. Andrew: — Mr. Speaker, I can advise the hon. member and I can advise the House 



 

December 19, 1984 

767 
 

that the corporation is concerned about it. I think I, as minister responsible, am concerned about it, and I am 

sure that the entire Assembly is concerned that this matter is, in fact, brought under control and brought under 

control as soon as possible. I will keep you informed of any information that I have, and I will keep the 

Assembly informed of any information I have. 

 

At this point in time it's a technical question at the mine site. Engineers, obviously, know far more than I do. I'm 

not sure what I could contribute at this particular point in time at the mine site. Certainly if the occasion requires 

my assistance there I would be only too happy to go, but at this point in time I'm not sure what I could do. 

 

Farm Credit Corporation Loans 

 

Mr. Engel: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have a question to the Minister of Agriculture this afternoon now, and 

it deals with your government's continuing inability to provide family farmers with financial help they need in 

these really troubled times. Farmers are under severe oppression not being able to cope and meet their power 

bills, etc. 

 

Yesterday there was news that one in four Saskatchewan farmers who have loans with Farm Credit Corporation 

are behind in their payments — 5,700 farmers are about $53 million in arrears, Mr. Minister. And even worse, 

660 of these farmers are the second year in arrears. A few days ago your Legislative Secretary told the public 

meeting that many of these farmers were inefficient and should get out of business. Is that your government's 

position, and is that why the farm legislation before this House today doesn't contain a thin dime for farmers? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — Mr. Chairman, our commitment to farmers in Saskatchewan, I think, is underscored 

and underlined by the Bill that's before this Assembly. We are not prepared to see thousands of farmers driven 

off their land. I think it's been well established that many of the farmers that in fact are in trouble today are not 

inefficient. They are not small farmers, but there is a group out there who are burdened with high debts who 

may have been farming as long as 10 years. They've been hooked with high interest rates and high land costs 

and low commodity prices. But all the surveys identify that group as being very productive, very aggressive 

farmers. They are good farmers. They are viewed in the community as good farmers, and of course, I think 

that's the reason for bringing a Bill such as this before the House to protect and provide some opportunity for 

them to survive in these difficult times. 

 

We've had cycles in this province before. We've had global cycles in terms of the economy. I suspect that we'll 

get through this one, and we're prepared to provide some breathing room, to be an economic shock absorber, 

and in fact as I would warn the hon. member again not to view this Bill in isolation, but to view it collectively. 

Put it together with our 8 per cent interest rate programs that are available for young and beginning farmers, and 

it's very unfortunate, it's very unfortunate during that eight and nine and 10 years when those productive farmers 

were getting themselves into difficulty because of high interest rates, that your administration didn't move to put 

in place a program like the farm purchase program which gave them low interest money at 8 per cent so they 

wouldn't have got hooked on this 16 and 20 per cent money, and we wouldn't be dealing with some of the 

problems we're dealing with today. But your administration, the NDP party in this province, chose not to 

provide interest rate support during those years. And now those farmers are paying the price for it. And you 

must view this in context as well in terms of what might happen in cash . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order, please. I'd advise the ministers that lengthy answers to questions are not allowed in 

question period. 

 

Mr. Engel: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Minister, the straight simple question was: your Legislative 

Secretary told a group of farmers — I suggest that there were only 17 at that meeting the other day, they tell me 

there was 117 people there, as the word you came back with — told those farmers that they were in trouble 

because they were inefficient and poor operators, 



 

December 19, 1984 

768 
 

and they've got to fall by the wayside. I'm asking you: is that why you don't have any help in this legislature? 

We're called together, we're here, Mr. Speaker, to deal with the serious problem facing farmers, and you have a 

Bill here that doesn't give them a dime. This is the first time since 1971 that, in one week, four of my 

constituents phoned me and said that . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order, please. The member rose on a supplementary and is making a speech, and I would ask 

him to get directly to the question. 

 

Mr. Engel: — Mr. Speaker, in light of the fact that he didn't answer my question, I'm asking a new question. 

We have run into a situation, Mr. Minister, where people — since you're in office — don't have enough money 

to even pay their power bills, let alone their other bills. What are you doing for the farmers that are in trouble, 

farmers that can't get their money from crop insurance, farmers that are waiting for their drought assistance 

payments, and are facing Christmas? You know, when a farmer's wife cries on the phone and says, we don't 

have money for Christmas presents, let alone we're threatened with registered mail that their power is going to 

be cut off. What are you planning to do for them? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — We will continue to put in place programs to protect those families and those farmers 

out there on their farms. We will continue to put programs in place to help ease cash flow and make sure they 

can, in fact, have operating funds to continue. And I can only remind the hon. member, in terms of what has 

been done in that past and what will be done in the future in terms of this government, we will do what is 

necessary. And I would only remind you that in 1971 when an even more extreme form, even more extreme 

form of debt moratorium legislation was put in place, not one thin dime was advanced by your government at 

that time. Now you're extremely generous in opposition. On one day, you proposed $30 an acre, a one and a 

half billion dollar payment — an irresponsible kind of solution. The next day, it was 7 per cent money. We will 

do what is necessary. 

 

Mr. Engel: — Mr. Speaker, a new question. Mr. Minister, have you bothered to go yourself or send some of 

your high-paid officials, former bankers, etc., have you bothered sending them out to our neighbouring areas to 

see what kind of programs are in place to salvage farmers? Have you bothered yet? Have you bothered going 

down to Montana, for example, and seeing what a democratic party in power can do for farmers when things are 

tough? Have you bothered looking at their interest abatement program, and seeing what farmers can do to 

survive that are in dire straits? Have you bothered looking around? Do you know what's happening around you? 

Have you looked? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — Mr. Speaker, hon. member, yes, I have looked around. And looking around I become 

even more proud of what our government has done to help farmers. I looked around and I . . . 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — . . . and I looked to the east of me. And what did I find? There in Manitoba, by every 

measure, by every statistic, by Farm Credit Corporation survey which I tabled in this House yesterday, the 

farmer problem is every bit as severe. And today I receive in this Assembly a press release from the minister 

over there. 

 

And what are they doing in Manitoba? Have they got a Bill before the House to deal with the debt problems out 

there? No. In fact, Mr. Speaker, is the house even sitting in Manitoba to deal with the farm problem? No. But 

what does the hon. member, who says I should look to the east for my answer, say? And what do I find in the 

east? We find nothing, literally. 

 

And in fact we find there the hon. minister suggesting that the answer lies with the federal 



 

December 19, 1984 

769 
 

government. And as well, I'm happy to say that we have had good co-operation from the federal government. In 

1971 there was go grains stabilization fund to fall back on. And we expect full well to see a very good payment 

out of that this next spring. 

 

(1615) 

 

We asked for years for removal of the federal tax on farm fuels, and we got that. We asked for years to see the 

domestic price of wheat moved up. We got that, putting another $35 million in the hands of farmers' pockets. 

 

So yes, I have looked around and I see action out of the federal government I see less action out of some 

provinces to the east. But in terms of what's happening across the border, yes, in fact, we have examined and 

had some discussions and looked at some material in so far as what Mr. Reagan's administration has proposed 

for some of his farmers that are suffering through the same kinds of problems here. 

 

And I would suggest to you that this province here is showing leadership, and many other provinces and 

jurisdictions are watching what we do. Because just as we introduced 8 per cent money in this legislature for 

our young and beginning farmers a year, a year and a half ago — two years ago today, almost — others in this 

country followed. Ontario followed, because they see it as a good program. And I would suggest to you, others 

will follow. We will continue to be leaders. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Engel: — Short supplementary. I can understand why the minister refuses to answer the question. I 

suggested to him that he look — or his officials, his former banker deputy minister — did he look at a program 

that's affecting the banks in Montana, not be a Reagan administration, but by Governor Schwinden, who has a 

program in place that says to the banker, if the farmer's in trouble your interest is zero? Why don't you try that? 

Why don't you try a program that works? Why don't you save the farmer millions of dollars like they do in 

Montana and a program that works? And don't go trying to defray the . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order, please. Order! The member is abusing the privileges of the House when he asks 

supplementaries that long. 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — Mr. Speaker, hon. member, I am not specifically familiar with that proposal. I know 

we've looked at some of the programs in the United States, Mr. Speaker, and I'd be happy to examine this one. 

 

I see a certain confusion on the opposition benches as to what their agricultural policy is. In the last 10 days I've 

heard them put forward a solution to the agricultural problem in this province: $30 an acre. Then when I blew 

them out of the water by pointing out their arithmetic was out by one decimal, and not 150 million by a $1.5 

billion package that would have tripled taxes in this province and doubled the deficit, they backed off that one. 

then, two days later, they came to this House and said, no, not $30 an acre. Let's have the 7 per cent solution. 

Now they're backing off that one because the arithmetic doesn't work out again, and they're suggesting we 

should look at the Schwinden solution. I'll look at it, but it may be as ludicrous as everything else you propose 

in this House. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Engel: — Mr. Speaker. New question, Mr. Speaker. The minister couldn't figure out a $30 an acre payment 

that costs $150 million. He has inability to figure a drought program out. So we give him a second offer on an 

interest rate. Well, here's another offer that Schwinden has put in the place that doesn't . . . 



 

December 19, 1984 

770 
 

Mr. Speaker: — Order, please. The member is giving information rather than asking for it. If you have a 

question, get to the question. 

 

Mr. Engel: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker, but the minister asked me a question and suggested . . . 

 

Mr. Speaker: — If the member has a question, get to it. If not, I'll call on another member. 

 

Mr. Engel: — Short supplementary question. Will you assure this House that before a couple of days are out, 

before Christmas, that you would look at a program that works like Montana has in place, to salvage some 

farmers? Will you at least do that much, your closest neighbour to the south? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — Looking at programs, options, and possibilities to help out the farm sector is an 

ongoing process with this administration. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I have a question for the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Minister, in a 

appearance before the Commons agricultural committee yesterday, the federal Minister of Agriculture, the Hon. 

John Wise, admitted that financial assistance for flooded farmers in north-east Saskatchewan is not a priority 

with them. 

 

Mr. Minister, are you aware of your federal counterpart’s attitude, and do you plan to call him today and tell 

him that financial assistance for north-eastern Saskatchewan farmers is long overdue by the federal 

government? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — Mr. Speaker, I have talked to the Minister of Agriculture for Canada on more than one 

occasion. In fact, aid for north-east farmers was one of the first things I had on my agenda at the very first 

meeting I had with him. I haven’t seen exactly what went on relative to the committee in Ottawa yesterday. My 

understanding is that Mr. Wise said it is going through the treasury board process. He believes it will be 

positive. And I suspect that we will be seeing something positive out of there as soon as they can accommodate 

him. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Supplementary, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Minister, the Minister of Agriculture, the Hon. John Wise, 

says that it is before treasury board. But he also states that it is not a priority with the treasury board. 

 

Will you get in contact with him today and say that the farmers of north-east Saskatchewan do need that help 

and that he should make it a priority? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hepworth: — Mr. Speaker, hon. member, as I said earlier, I have been in contact with him on more 

than one occasion. He knows that I view it as a priority. And I would suggest to you that we're wanting to see 

the actual transcript and not rely on your head research division the Leader-Post, for your back-up, that you 

may well be taking what he said out of context. 

 

I know he views it as a priority. I have raised it with him on more than one occasion. And I suspect that he will 

be accommodating us just as soon as he can. 

 

Backlog in Dental Plan for Children 

 

Mr. Lingenfelter: — Question to the Minister of Health. Mr. Minister, you will know that your government 

has continually underfunded and understaffed the area of children's dental plan in the province of 

Saskatchewan. Mr. Minister, when you came to power you immediately removed the four-year-olds from the 

plan and stripped away the increase in the plan to include 17-year-olds. 



 

December 19, 1984 

771 
 

Now we are getting many questions from parents who are talking about backlogs in the schools, and I would 

like you to inform the Assembly: how many children are waiting to see a dentist in the schools of 

Saskatchewan? 

 

Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Mr. Speaker, of course, the hon. member opposite is not correct in his preamble. We have 

not caused cuts in the dental plan. As far as the number of students, and as to the backlog of today, I'd have to 

take note. 

 

Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I have here a letter, a new question, which I would like to quote the minister 

that would bring him up to date. And members call for it to be tabled. I will table it when I have an opportunity 

after question period. The letter is addressed to a parent which says in the first paragraph: 

 

It is not possible for us to treat all of the children enrolled from your school at the present time. Therefore, it is 

necessary to divide the children into two groups: one, those currently receiving treatment; and secondly, those 

awaiting treatment. And your child is in the group awaiting treatment. 

 

Now this letter, Mr. Minister, has been sent to hundreds of parents in the city of Regina because there aren't 

enough dental nurses to perform the duty. You will know In the budget of this year the number of people 

working in that program has been reduced from 510 to 427. And I would like you to inform the Assembly, and 

those parents who have children waiting, what they should do in the interim while they're waiting for dental 

care. 

 

Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Mr. Speaker, again, the member is wrong. If he would keep up with what's taking place 

he would know that quoting the figure from the blue book is not an accurate assumption of what's taking place 

in the dental plan. 

 

A number of children in Regina and various parts of Saskatchewan are being serviced by the private sector 

dentists in this province, and I should say well serviced. And certainly there are some people that are waiting for 

service, as there always has been. I said I would take note, as of today, how many are waiting. But the children 

are waiting for service. Whether it be with the dental nurses or the private practice dentist is no different than it 

has ever been. 

 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Supplementary, Mr. Speaker. I wonder whether the minister would, in the course of 

taking notice, also advise the House whether or not the practice of sending out letters to parents in Regina 

saying their children were put on hold has been a practice which has been widely used in the past, as it is now 

being widely used? Or whether this is something new so far as its widespread use is concerned. 

 

Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Well, I would certainly take note. I would say that this government is certainly a 

government that is in connection, and deals with the parents, deal with the people of this province. I don't know 

if the previous government ever notified anyone about anything. I think they though they had all the answers. 

Certainly, if there's a waiting list, we would let the parents know that there's a period of time that their child had 

to be waiting. 

 

Also, yes, my colleague beside me indicates something that I've noticed for sometime here, that I'm very 

suspect of portions of letters that are read by the people opposite. I'd like them to table the whole letter. 

 

Premier's Letter to Public Servants 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question is to the Premier. Ten days ago I asked him about a 

letter which he sent to our public servants. I asked you for how much information . . . I asked you for 

information on how the letters had been sent out, how many 



 

December 19, 1984 

772 
 

there were, the cost of them, and the reason for the mass mailing. 

 

On page 340 of Hansard, you clearly said you would supply this information to the Assembly and the public. I 

ask you for that information now. 

 

Hon. Mr. Devine: — Mr. Speaker, I don't have it with me, but I will provide it. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — New question. It is my understanding, Mr. Premier, that such letters went to all of the 

public service and all Crown corporation employees. 

 

My question is: how many of these letters were delivered to employees, and at what cost? And why should the 

Saskatchewan taxpayer be footing the bill, in these difficult times, for the Conservative Party's propaganda? 

 

Hon. Mr. Devine: — Mr. Speaker, I told the hon. member that I would provide the information, and, Mr. 

Speaker, the hon. member knows that it has nothing to do with the Conservative Party. It is from the Premier of 

the province to employees saying, thank you very much for all your hard work, for your co-operation, for you 

conscientious efforts. And I would believe, Mr. Speaker, that that would be generally well received from public 

employees across Canada. 

 

I don't recall letters of congratulations, and thank you, and so forth, being provided by the NDP when whey 

were in power. Maybe they were. I f they did, I would congratulate them. If they weren't, then I would think 

maybe it's something that they should have considered, and maybe it's one of the reasons that they're sitting 

over there today, and we're sitting here. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Availability of Public Accounts 

 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Speaker, I direct a question to the Minister of Finance, and it deals with the 

availability of public accounts. The minister will know that it has been, at least for the last three or four or five 

years and I hadn't checked how much farther back, the Auditor has given his certificate dates in September, or 

perhaps the 15th of October, and the Public Accounts have therefore been at least available in one sense of the 

word, although not always distributed. 

 

My question to the minister is: are the Public Accounts available for distribution? And if the answer is, no, not 

at this time, will he distribute them in between this portion of the session and the following session so that they 

will be available for use by members prior to the convening of the session in March or whenever it is? 

 

Hon. Mr. Andrew: — Mr. Speaker, I could advise the hon. member that the publishing of the Public Accounts 

falls under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Revenue and Financial Services and the comptroller. 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I will advise the members opposite that, yes, we will distribute the 

Public Accounts to all members of the House as soon as they're printed, which should be in the new year, 

shortly in the new year.

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

 

Bill No. 18 – An Act to amend The Automobile Accident Insurance Act 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Chairman: — Would the minister introduce his officials? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce Mr. Kuss, to my left, who is the legislation 

advisor; and Mr. Fogg, who is vice-president in charge of AAIA (Automobile Accident Insurance Act). 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Would the minister just confirm that these amendments, these increased benefits, will come 

into effect on April 1st? Will you just confirm that that's your intention or, if it is not, give me the date? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Well no, Mr. Chairman, the amendments will — or the increased benefits come in 

effect on January 1st. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — For the year 1985 then, what will be the cost of these increased benefits to the fund? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, approximately 2.5. Somewhere between 2.5 and $2.9 million. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 2 to 4 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 5 

 

Mr. Shillington: — With respect to Clause 5 and the rates appeal board, will the rates appeal board be sitting in 

places other than Regina? If I live in Shoeho or Hooey where do I have to go to — Sheho and Hoey — sorry 

about that, my apologies to all the fine burghers of that community. Where would those people have to go to 

have it heard? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, for the hon. member, I inform him that we will be appointing board 

members in each claims centre, and therefore in the future we will be holding hearings or appeals in each claim 

centre. 



 

December 19, 1984 

775 
 

Mr. Shillington: — Well perhaps for these — perhaps for my benefit you could define what you mean by a 

claims centre. 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Yes, Mr. — the definition of a claims centre is where the — where adjusting is done 

on the vehicles, on accidents of those vehicles. I could . . . 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Fine, I understand that, so in the incident case I've got, I guess I go to Yorkton. But what 

you are saying is you are going to have local people who are members of the board from each claims centre, at 

each claims centre, who will be available — on a whatever — weekly basis or whatever, to hear these claims? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — The appointments will be made by the Lieutenant Governor in Council and we will 

have those people in those, within those areas, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — And will there be any cost attached to the hearing? Will there be any fee? 

 

(1645) 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, we will start the program with no fee. And we'll monitor that as we go 

to see how -e what the frequency of those appeals are. And if necessary we may, in due course, impose a fee on 

the appeal. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Has the minister given consideration to appointing these people for a given defined term, 

so that they enjoy some independence of stature? The difficulty, I think, that SGI is going to have, is that if they 

don't enjoy some visible degree of independence, when the decision goes against the policy-holder the public 

may make the accusation that it's a stacked deck. 

 

And it strikes me as being in the best interest of Saskatchewan Government Insurance and the fund, which is the 

immediate, I suppose, party. It strikes me that it's in their best interest to give these people some visible degree 

of independence. that could be done by appointing them for a term certain. 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Well, Mr. Chairman, I want to remind the hon. member that previously the appellant 

had to appeal his case in court. What we're doing now is giving him that choice. He can appeal through an 

appeal board or can still go to court. It's his choice. And yes, we certainly . . . It is our intention to have it an 

independent appeal board. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — The question was: will you appoint them for a term certain, so that they not only are said to 

be independent but, in fact are independent? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, I don't see any problem with that suggestion. We don't know at this 

point what the term will be, but I'd suggest a limited term to start with, and then we'll review that in due course. 

But I see no problem with a limited term. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Has the minister made any decision about what compensation will be paid to the board 

members? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — We'll be, I suppose, checking the guide-lines on those kinds of appeal boards, Mr. 

Chairman. The Lieutenant Governor in Council will make that decision, and it will be a per diem remuneration 

that we'll be looking at. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — I don't physically have the regulations section in front of me, but I seem 



 

December 19, 1984 

776 
 

to remember the regulations section being broad enough to permit the Lieutenant Governor in Council to make 

regulations governing the operation of this appeal board. Do you have those regulations drafted now, since the 

thing's going into effect on January 1st, and if so, will you table those regulations? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, I would refer the member to the coming into force clause of 41 which 

states that clause 8, which we're referring to, sections 4, 5, 7, and 25, will come into force on a day to be fixed 

by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, at which time we will then have the administrative paperwork in 

place for . . . 

 

Mr. Shillington: — I had assumed, I guess mistakenly, that the whole Bill would come into force on January 

1st. I guess that's not so. When would the minister anticipate that this system would be set up? When will you 

anticipate proclaiming these sections then? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that at this point, without a firm commitment, as soon 

as possible, probably in the round to 90 days to 120 days would be the time that we'd need to put all the 

regulations in place and the administrative process in place as well. 

 

Clause 6 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 7 to 14 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 15 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Section 14 is one of the ones that's going to come into effect on January 1st, I gather. What 

amount is going to be prescribed in regulations then? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — The amount by regulation would $150 per week, Mr. Chairman. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Generally with respect to these sections then, just so we don't have to repeat this song and 

dance on them al, generally with respect to these sections then those . . . With respect to those figures that are to 

be set by regulations which were set in the Act, are those regulations now drafted, and can they be table? If not, 

when does the minister expect to be proclaiming such regulations? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Well, Mr. Chairman, I won't be tabling the regulations today, but I will assure the hon. 

member that they will be ready before it comes into force. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — I'm sorry. I was distracted when you made that comment. 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — I said I won't table the regulations, but they will be available before January 1st. 

 

Clause 15 agreed to. 

 

Clause 16 agreed to. 

 

Clause 17 

 

Mr. Chairman: — There's an amendment, House amendment, to clause 17, moved by the minister of SGI: 

 

Section 17 of the printed Bill: subsection 26(1) of the Act as being enacted by section 17 of the printed Bill is 

amended by striking out "in the amount prescribed in the regulations" and substituting the following: 



 

December 19, 1984 

777 
 

the amount and determination of which is in the absolute discretion of the insurer provided that the amount 

does not exceed the amount prescribed in the regulations. 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Hon. member, without the question even coming across, all it was is a clerical error. in 

the printing of the Bill there was a clerical error. part of the sentence was omitted. We are now including it. 

 

Clause 17 as amended agreed to. 

 

Clauses 18 to 20 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 21 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Mr. Minister, is not this a change in policy? I had always understood that the estate was 

entitled to benefits where a deceased died without having actually received them. 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Well, Mr. Chairman, it's just a rewording. There's no change in policy. It is a 

reworking of the previous clause. 

 

Clause 21 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 22 to 34 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 35 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Just for my own curiosity, does the minister have the breakdown of the cost of this 

particular increase in benefits? Do you know what it costs to provide the increase in benefits under section 35? 

 

Hon. Mr. Rousseau: — Mr. Chairman, the $200,000 liability limits will be approximately $2 million, the 

balance being for the other benefits. We do have a breakdown. I don't have it with me. I'll provide the member 

with a breakdown if he so desired. 

 

Clause 35 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 36 to 41 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

(1700) 

 

Mr. Chairman: — I'd like to thank the minister's officials.

Bill No. 21 - An Act to amend The Snowmobile Act 

 

Mr. Chairman: — Would the minister introduce his officials? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — Mr. Chairman, . . . (inaudible) . . . from SGI sitting to my left, and chairman of highway 

traffic board, Mr. Bill McLaren, sitting over to my right. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clause 2 

 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Minister, I don't know quite what the clause is because I 

haven't turned it up yet, but the provision which repeals a section, can you tell us what section is repealed? Am I 

on the . . . 21. Okay. 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — Mr. Chairman it repeals section 19, which directly goes to the surcharge. 

 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — I beg . . . which, I'm sorry? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — . . . (inaudible) . . . of The Snowmobile Act is repealed. 

 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — And what was in section 19 which was being repealed? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — I'll send you a copy of it over, or I can read it all to you if you . . . (inaudible interjection) 

. . . Just prepayment of the surcharge. 

 

Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Why don't we need that any more? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — Because the system is being changed under the automobile insurance Act. 

 

Clause 2 agreed to. 
 
Clause 3 agreed to. 
 
The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 22 — An Act to amend The Vehicles Act, 1983 
 
Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. 
 
Clause 3 
 
Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, in repealing this Act, you are . . . (inaudible) . . . surcharge. Are you putting this 

in a certain clause in The Vehicles Act, or not The Vehicles Act, but The Automobile Accident Insurance Act, 

which is going to cover this? Or what is happening? 
 
Hon. Mr. Garner: — This clause is no longer required, Mr. Chairman, because this clause goes into The 

Automobile Accident Insurance Act. 
 
Mr. Lusney: — Could you just briefly state what that section in the Act is that's going to cover what you are 

repealing? 
 
Hon. Mr. Garner: — Mr. Chairman, if we can just have clarification. Were you talking about 



 

December 19, 1984 

779 
 

section 19 of The Vehicles Act, or as it pertains to section 19 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act? 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Section 19 of The Vehicles Act, which is repealed, Mr. Minister; what section in The Vehicles 

Act is going to cover the section that you're repealing, or in The Automobile Accident Insurance Act? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — Once the surcharge is paid up front, this section will no longer be required. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — I do not understand your explanation of the system. Perhaps you can explain for my 

benefit. I followed you so far as you said that the section was not needed because the procedure as it changed 

what was in The Automobile Accident Insurance Act. What we don't understand is what's changed. 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — We won't be issuing temporary licences once the surcharge is paid. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Somewhere here, Mr. Minister, I'll have to admit that I cam confused. I don't know about my 

colleague from Regina Centre. you're saying that if a surcharge is paid, you will no longer be issuing a 

temporary licence. What kind of licence are you going to issue? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — A permanent, ordinary licence. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Well then what we are going to see is no longer a permit to drive for a certain period of time. Is 

this what this clause does, eliminate that temporary licence that has been issued, and when a surcharge is paid 

for whatever the penalty is, they get an ordinary licence? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — Mr. Chairman, we're going to be cutting down on the length of time. Right now, the way 

it is, you have your surcharge, your appeal, your temporary, you go to court, you pay, you get your licence. 

Right now you pay your surcharge, you get your licence, and then the appeal afterwards. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — So this section just pertains to an appeal on your licence? If you don't appeal it, then 

automatically you're not going to be receiving a licence, but if you appeal it, you're saying that the person gets 

his licence back pending that appeal? 

 

Hon. Mr. Garner: — He gets his licence up front and . . . once he pays his surcharge. 

 

Clause 3 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 4 to 7 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 8 — An Act to amend The Legal Profession Act 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Koskie: — Yes, we, in your absence, Mr. Minister, we indicated some of our objections, and I don't think 

it's necessary to repeat those. the basic concern that we had is that what we're doing here is amending one year 

after the section was amended previously, and primarily in respect to the retroactivity of it. 

 

I just would ask you to give your comments in the desirability of retroactivity within the provisions of the Bill 

and, sort of, the justifications as you see them. 



 

December 19, 1984 

780 
 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — I don't like the question of retroactivity any more than the hon. members. This is at the 

request of the benchers of the law society. If the hon. members, I suppose, wish to bring in an amendment to do 

away with the retroactivity, they tell me that there is a particular problem now before them, that they feel it 

necessary to continue with the proceedings; I'm taking that at face value. 

 

(1715) 

 

I can't defend it in any other way. I share the concerns. I don't like retroactivity generally, but, as I believe the 

Leader of the Opposition indicated the other day, there are degrees of necessity for retroactivity. This is not one 

that I prefer, but it's at their request. That's the only defence I can give you. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — Well, in respect to the change that was initiated last year, it had to come through your office, 

Mr. Minister, wherein the six-month limitation was increased to one year. And the apparent foul-up is that it 

became all inclusive, that is, as I understand it, including the discipline action. 

 

I think we can agree that the one-year limitation on the process of disciplining a member may be rather short, 

and we can recognize that. But by the very nature of the difficulty for the law society of being able to, in fact, 

know exactly when the breach took place . . . and often it comes to their attention quite a ways down the road 

and doesn't leave them a lot of time in order to do an investigation. We appreciate that. 

 

Our major concern is that the legislation which was proposed, not to cover the item of disciplinary action, did 

go through your office. And to some extent, I think, without putting it too strongly, I would have thought that it 

would have been caught by the Justice department that, in fact, it was an all-encompassing piece of legislation, 

covering also the discipline, as well as the other aspect of the Act. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — The procedure, as the hon. member probably knows, in something of this nature, which was 

brought forward to the department by a request from the benchers, the drafting would be done by the 

department. It is then submitted back to the benchers for their approval and their consideration, and they 

approved it on that basis. 

 

It's not something that we are sitting here advocating the cause for. It's at their request. We did the drafting. we 

submitted it to them for their consideration. As the benchers have told me informally, they reviewed it quite 

thoroughly and were quite satisfied with it, so I can say nothing more than that. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 2 to 4 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 12 — An Act to amend The Land Titles Act 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Koskie: — I wonder if the minister could just quickly indicate what necessitated the amendments here, and 

whether there was any particular consultation that you had to go through relative to the introduction of them. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — My officials advise me that there was no specific problem that brought it to fore. It was just 

to bring The Land Titles Act in compliance, or using the same terminology, as The 



 

December 19, 1984 

781 
 

Planning and Development Act. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clause 2 agreed to. 

 

Clause 3 

 

Mr. Koskie: — That retroactive provision in clause 3. Perhaps the minister could outline the reason that it's 

retroactive to April 17, 1984. I assume that it's coming into effect of the previous Act. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well it's again simply to bring it in line with the community . . . I'm sorry, The Planning 

and Development Act. If there's an issue on retroactivity, we're prepared to withdraw it. But it was just, on 

drafting, to bring it in line with the date that The Planning and Development Act received assent. We're not 

married to it at all. But if it's an issue, we're prepared to withdraw that. But that's all it's done for. 

 

Clause 3 agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 16 — An Act respecting Court Officials 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Koskie: — This Bill, according to my understanding, was introduced in the last session and was not 

proceeded with. What I'd like to ask the minister first of all, before we go into the specific clauses, whether, in 

fact, there has been some consultation in respect to the drawing up of the new Court Officials Act here? And 

would you indicate what groups you had consultation with, whether those that are going to be affected — that is 

the court officials may well be affected by the Bill — and the legal profession I would have thought might have 

some interest in it, perhaps the judges themselves. Can the minister indicate what process of consultation that it 

underwent? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — My officials advise me that most of the changes are administrative internally and would not 

concern or affect either the bar or the bench, and it's primarily an updating of the legislation that was in effect 

before, with some relatively minor changes that I've referred to in my second reading speech. So it's an internal 

administration, and it's not normal in a case like that to discuss that with the bench or the bar. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — It may well affect some of the employees in respect to their location and allocation to centres, 

and I was wondering whether there was any particular discussion with employees because I've talked to some 

who have some apprehension about it, rightly or wrongly. And I was just wondering whether there has been any 

particular discussion with them? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — No, the Act doesn't affect them in any way. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clause 2 agreed to. 

 

Clause 3 

 

Mr. Koskie: — You indicated that what you were doing is clarifying the method of appointment of the court 

officials. And in clause 3(1), Mr. Minister, you indicated: "The Lieutenant 



 

December 19, 1984 

782 
 

Governor may appoint a Registrar of Courts." 

 

In clause 3(2) it says, "The minister or his designate may appoint a person to hold office and perform the duties 

. . ." And it goes on. 

 

What I'd like to ask you is: how were the court officials previously appointed? Were they be order in council, or 

what particular method in so far as the appointment of the officials? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — I can read a rather lengthy explanation, but I think it sets it out. 

 

The present act does not make it clear how a court official is to be appointed. The practice is that court 

officials, apart from the registrar of courts, are public servants appointed by the Public Service Commission. 

However, the PSC appoints such employees to the position of judicial officer. 

 

Since it is necessary, under many statutes, that the official be specifically appointed as a sheriff or a local 

registrar, etc., a practice has been developed whereby PSC makes, a dual appointment of the employees as 

both a judicial officer and, for example, a sheriff. 

 

The procedure is cumbersome, and some difficulties have been experienced in regard to proving the 

appointment of an employee as a court official. Furthermore, this current arrangement only applies to 

permanent employees and not to temporary or casual employees. 

 

So the new section regarding appointment preserves the dual system, in that the permanent employees will be 

hired through the PSC as judicial officers. However, the duty of appointing them specifically as court officials 

is given to the minister, or his designate, who will probably be the inspector of legal offices. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — So, just for clarification, since you were reading from the rather lengthy explanation, am I clear 

on this, that you're saying that the appointments under subsection (2) will continue to be made through the 

Public Service Commission? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Yes. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — I'm not sure I understand that. Would the minister explain the procedure for me — take me 

from the point of view of a vacant local registrar at Yorkton, and tell me how, what steps there are in approving 

X-Y as the final applicant? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well, let's assume that there is a vacant position, new person to be appointed. They would 

go through the Public Service Commission. But they would be appointed as a judicial officer. That's the PSC 

position. 

 

We then have the dual position of maybe designating for proof purposes, or that it be a sheriff, that that judicial 

officer have sheriff's duties or sheriff's titles. 

 

So it's that dual appointment that causes the problem. And they still have to go through and be appointed as 

judicial officers through the normal process. But rather than going a second appointment route and proving it, 

we have now set up the procedure for it. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — Just so I'm clear. The Public Service Commission . . . These positions will be filled through the 

Public Service Commission, you indicate, but they will be appointed as a judicial officer — appointed as a 

judicial officer, I understood you to say. Where, then, does the minister's power come into play? 



 

December 19, 1984 

783 
 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well, supposing you have a judicial officer who has come through the PSC appointment, 

but under The Queen's bench Act you want to name a sheriff or an officer under The Surrogate Court Act, the 

same individual who's gone through the process may have different titles. And it's that titling that's causing the 

difficulty. And this just expedites that. They still have to go through and be hired and appointed as judicial 

officers. It's which title they may be designated from time to time, depending on the Act, that they're 

empowered to carry out. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — What is your basis for saying that they still have to be appointed as a judicial officer? This 

section suggests, given the natural meaning of those words, this section suggests that you can pick up Joe 

Bifstick off the street and make him a local registrar. It says, you may appoint a person to be. It doesn't say, you 

may appoint a judicial officer. I understand your explanation, except that that's not what the section says. 

 

Just if I may make one further comment. You explained the difference between temporary and permanent 

appointments. that is the way it is in every department. In every department, temporaries may be appointed by 

the deputy minister, or minister, as the case is. Permanent people have to go through the PSC. This section 

suggests that all employees will be handled in the manner in which temporary employees are handled. The 

section does not read what you just said unless there's another section somewhere which has escaped our 

attention. 

 

(1730) 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — It does, because it assumes that there . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Well we're not going 

through and changing the PSC and designating judicial officers. That's how they will be hired. They will be 

judicial officers in the normal course. There'll be no change in the system of the internal management of PSC, 

but there will be differing titles from time to time. And we have had, I gather, some difficulty in proving the 

appointment of a judicial officer who may be a deputy inspector under a particular Act, or who may be the 

deputy registrar of the court of appeal, or may be a local registrar. So it's that second title which will change 

from time to time that the minister designates. And it's just a proving matter. The hiring through the normal 

PSC, as judicial officers, continues. We're just dealing with the differing titles here. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — It goes through the public service, and you get a judicial officer, and then you have the various 

court officials. Is it then the jurisdiction of the minister to decide on all of those judicial officers who he's going 

to, I suppose, appoint as deputy inspector, or local registrar, or deputy local registrar of the surrogate court? 

 

That's what it seems to me, is that you reduce down the function of the public service because in any other 

employment within the department, as I understand it, if you want a particular position filled, then the public 

service proceeds to fill that particular position. And why would it be different with — why the exception of not 

having the public service follow the usual course? If the Department of Justice wanted a deputy inspector, that it 

go through the process of finding a deputy inspector, rather than the broad term of judicial officer; I don't follow 

that. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — They're all hired as judicial officers through the PSC in the normal course. But the total that 

they may have from time to time, either as a local registrar, or a deputy registrar of the local registrar of the 

unified family court, we can designate those — I say nominal functions, through the PSC in the normal course. 

 

They're still judicial officers. They're all judicial officers, but they may have a different title designation in 

addition to being judicial officers. 

 

I mean, it's a long-standing process. This is not an employment provision, but it's really designating the title and 

making sure that we can prove the title whenever it's called upon. So there's no real change, except allowing the 

minister to make that designation for whatever 



 

December 19, 1984 

784 
 

purposes the courts decide. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Why, in this respect, is the Department of Justice not making itself an exception to the 

general rule that salary levels, job descriptions, and titles are the prerogative of the Public Service Commission? 

 

Presumably under this you can take a local registrar, make him a deputy local registrar, and so on, without any 

protection. You can change, presumably, the functions and, presumably, the salary of these people without the 

protection of the Public Service Commission. And I wonder why there is an exception being made for the 

Justice department. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Except that it's not right. What you say is not correct. There's no exception being made. 

They are hired as judicial officers. 

 

I suppose the simple explanation, if you go to clause 3, subclause (2), where it says "to hold the office"; these 

are merely designating the office. They're not doing anything with employment of judicial officers. It's the 

offices that may be designated from time to time. 

 

Their employment status is that of judicial officers, and they go up the normal ranges. They're hired as judicial 

officers. But the office may change from time to time. It has no effect on their employment status at all. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — What's the difference between this and, take accounting clerks? There are accounting clerk 

positions here, there, and everywhere, some of those jobs more attractive than others, some which have a higher 

salary than others. 

 

And if you are the government services, or the Department of Justice, you not only have to get the person 

appointed to the position of accounting clerk, but then, if you want to move them from being an accounting 

clerk in government services to an accounting clerk in the Justice department, or whatever, you have to get that 

approved by the Public Service Commission. 

 

I don't see why you're making court officials into an exception, that the Public Service Commission is involved, 

not just in the appointment to the classification, but in the appointment to the particular job. It seems to me that 

you're making an exception for yourself. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — I suppose, if there is an exception, it comes from the different offices that are designated by 

different statues, like The Surrogate Court Act, The Queen's Bench Act, whatever specific Act that's been in 

place for some considerable period of time which has established historical offices. 

 

Now if the hon. member is arguing that we should get rid of all those historical offices and just stay with the 

judicial officer, I suppose we could look at that, but it wasn't the intent of the Act to make that substantive 

change. We're really just making sure that the designation of the office is easily provable and gives us the 

efficiency to just make the designation, and therefore we have proof of it. So it's not an employment position, 

it's strictly, as clause 2 says, it's the office. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — It seems to me, Mr. Minister, that the . . . I'll grant you that the existing system may be 

cumbersome. It is, in all respects. You could increase the efficiency of appointments a good deal by abolishing 

the Public Service Commission. But it's there for the protection of the employees, to ensure that they are given 

fair treatment and equal treatment, and it's there for the protection of the public, to ensure that we have a 

professional public service. 

 

I frankly think that the existing system does a better job of protecting the rights of the employees, and probably 

a better job of ensuring that the appointment are not done on a patronage basis; that you don't promote those 

who you believe are your friends, and neglect 



 

December 19, 1984 

785 
 

those whom you believe to be your enemies. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — I mean, you don't want to get into that debate too long in this particular area, I can caution 

the hon. member. But having said that, if we go back to the previous Act, the previous Act sets out the power of 

appointment: 

 

There may be appointed such court officials as registrar or local registrar . . . deputy to any registrar, local 

registrar of any court . . . sheriff or deputy sheriff, court reporter . . . 

 

So that here's the problem with the previous Act which sets out all of those positions, titles, who were — in 

addition to the title designated from time to time, the office that they held — also judicial officers. 

 

But the Act made no reference as to who may make the appointment. And there became an evidentiary problem 

and a questioning of the power to make the appointment. So it doesn't affect the public service administration in 

any way, shape, or form . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . You are, are you? I mean, I'm not going to sit and have 

the two lawyers on the other side stand up and tell me that the whole historical process of titles and everything 

else should be thrown out. I don't think they're saying that seriously. 

 

But the previous Act, if we make the distinction between an office and the normal PSC employment provisions, 

then I don't see the difficulty. And the offices have, in many cases, except for that of the local registrar of the 

unified family court, which is a rather new position, have some historical basis. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — Now would you just run it by us here? There are different court officials. There's the deputy 

inspector, the deputy registrar of court of appeal, and so on. Now if you need some of these, and you want to put 

into effect the minister's power here to designate, what happens in the public service? What do they provide 

you? And then, what do you do following that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — The judicial officer is appointed through the normal PSC, or hired through the normal PSC 

. . . (inaudible interjection) . . . No, they can't. No. They may rate a judicial officer from a 1 to a 3; that would be 

done in the normal course. you may have a deputy local registrar who is a judicial officer 1, and you may have 

one that's a judicial officer 3, depending on years of experience and however the PSC categorize them. So it 

doesn't affect their employment status in any way, shape, or form. The only thing that's affected is the office. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — I don't want to pursue this much longer, but, as I said, there are a number of court officials. 

Obviously what you want for a deputy inspector is a different qualifications, probably, than what you want for 

the deputy registrar. And what I'm saying is: how do you get that into the public service? Because what you're 

saying, they appoint all judicial officers. And where do they get their criteria? Why aren't they looking for you 

— you want a deputy registrar — why aren't they looking for a judicial officer which, in fact, has the 

qualifications, and which can be designated as potential deputy registrars, and you pick out the one which is 

most qualified? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well, I mean, you've been through the PSC. I mean, this is not a change in the appointment 

of judicial officers. Then there's no change. The criteria . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Well, the criteria are 

established by the department whenever they come up with a job description in the normal course. Okay? The 

job description of judicial officers was decided by your administration some time ago. There's been no change 

in that whatsoever. There's been no change in that whatsoever. The only difference here is that the previous Act 

didn't set out who was to make the appointments of the offices that are listed, which are the sheriff, deputy 

sheriff, etc. All that this does is state who is to make that designation. It's an evidentiary change as opposed to 

any substantive change. 



 

December 19, 1984 

786 
 

An Hon. Member: — Short and sweet, Ned. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — All right. On the instructions of your House Leader, short and sweet. What is the existing 

system for appointments? How does it work? And what changes are you introducing, then? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Okay. First of all, the existing system is one that has been for some several years. There's 

no change in the existing system. The only change is that the previous Act did not set out who was to make the 

designation of the office . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . Pardon? It's been done by the department historically, 

but there's been no power to do it. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — I take it, then, that what you are telling us, after 25 minutes, is that you are simply 

confirming existing practice in the department. If that's what you're saying, all I can say is, you might have said 

it 25 minutes ago and saved this House some time. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — The problem is, I did say it 25 minutes ago. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — On subsection 3, Mr. Minister: 

 

The minister or his designate may determine the area of Saskatchewan in which a person appointed pursuant 

to this section shall maintain his office and perform his duties. 

 

Does that change the present provisions? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — No, no change. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — The 3(2)(e) says, "the local registrar or deputy local registrar of the Unified Family Court 

for any judicial centre." Might we hope from this section that the Unified Family Court will be expanded 

beyond Saskatoon? Because in my experience, it is a great improvement over the system used elsewhere. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well, you can certainly hope. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — What are the prospects? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Being fulfilled. We’re taking a very serious look at it. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — What do you mean by taking a serious look? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — That's why it took me 25 minutes to explain the previous section. A serious look is a 

serious look. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — To summarize, you have no intention of expanding the Unified Family Court beyond the 

city of Saskatoon in the immediate future. I gather that's how one might summarize that rather flippant answer. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — I don't know how you could so misinterpret a simple statement as the one I made. 

 

(1745) 

 

Clause 3 agreed to on division. 

 

Clauses 4 to 7 inclusive agreed to. 



 

December 19, 1984 

787 
 

Clause 8 

 

Mr. Koskie: — Yes, I was just wondering, Mr. Minister. The Inspector of Legal Offices, as I understand it, this 

is a new creature of this Act? I understand it was not present in the previous. Is that correct? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — We've always had one, or had one for the last several years, but it's never been set out in the 

Act. The previous provision was 43(2), where it said: 

 

The Lieutenant Governor in Council may appoint an inspector to examine into the affairs of any present or 

former official administrator or other public official, and to report thereon . . . 

 

So we're just bringing into legislation what's been in practice for some time. 

 

Clause 8 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 9 to 12 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 13 

 

Mr. Koskie: — Just in respect to Clause 13, I'm just wondering in respect to subsection 3, Mr. Minister: 

 

Where the local registrar is satisfied that a claim may be made to moneys paid to the Minister of Finance . . . 

he may request that the Minister of Finance pay the amount into court . . . 

 

I'm wondering why "no interest is payable by the Minister of Finance." 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — There never has been in moneys paid into court in that circumstance. All that this does is, 

previously you had to go and get a court order to make the payment out. We're leaving that up to the registrar, 

which should save the public's money. 

 

Clause 13 agreed to. 

 

Clause 14 agreed to. 

 

Clause 15 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Just a brief question here with respect to payment of fees. Is the Justice department 

considering setting up deposit accounts for lawyers at the local registrar's office instead of the archaic system of 

stamps, licking stamps, and packing them on a document? The system used by the land titles office is so much 

better, and so much more efficient. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — Well, we're looking at a new accounting system to do that. 

 

Mr. Koskie: — When is that likely to come into place? How far is the study on? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lane: — We would expect it would be 1985. 

 

Clause 15 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 16 to 23 inclusive agreed to.

Bill No. 14 — An Act to amend The Planning and Development Act, 1983 

 

Clauses 1 to 18 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 15 — An Act to amend The Wakamow Valley Authority Act 

 

Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 4 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Would the minister outline for my benefit the existing provisions with respect to 

withdrawal from the Wakamow Valley Authority? 

 

Hon. Mr. Embury: — Mr. Chairman, there are no existing provisions for withdrawal. The new provisions will 

allow either R.M., on a year's notice, to withdraw. 
 
Mr. Shillington: — There is no existing provision whereby an R.M. may withdraw from this authority. Is this 

the same as it is with the Meewasin Valley Authority? 
 
Hon. Mr. Embury: — That's correct, Mr. Chairman, and the authority has requested this provision to be put in. 
 
Mr. Shillington: — Is it an academic problem or an actual problem? Is it some R.M. wants to withdraw, or is it 

just an academic question in the sense that the authority feels they should have such a provision in the event that 

any R.M. wishes to withdraw? 
 
Hon. Mr. Embury: — Mr. Chairman, it's academic. The actual meat of this amendment is so that one of them 

can join. So it's just academic. 
 
Clause 4 agreed to. 



 

December 19, 1984

Clauses 5 to 7 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 23 — An Act to amend The Urban Municipality Act, 1984 

 

Clauses 1 to 4 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 5 

 

Mr. Shillington: — With respect to clause 5, Mr. Chairman, the new addition 3(1). What's the existing 

situation now? Is this a change, or are you tidying up the wording, or what? What improvement is being effect 

by clause 5, subsection 2? 

 

Hon. Mr. Embury: — Mr. Chairman, section 5 of the existing Bill contained additional powers for council that 

we didn't want them to have, and that was the power to hire, suspend, or dismiss any employee — which would 

contravene union contracts and would contravene their rights for appeal and what have you, under their own 

contracts — so that we wanted to shorten that up. What was meant was that councils should have the power to 

dismiss their senior managers or out-of-scope people, and not their in-scope people. 

 

After that, the other sections were simply to clarify that the term "municipal employee," that councils would 

have the choice of having those employees that are employed by board or commission set up by a municipality, 

that those employees could be the employees of the board or commission, if that's the way they wish to set up 

that arms-lengths commission, rather than having all those employees as being employees of the municipality 

which set up this commission. So they may or may not do that, but this gives them that flexibility. 

 

(1800) 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Would the minister outline, for my benefit, the extent of consultations which you may have 

had with respect to this Bill, both with SUMA (Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association) and with the 

union which represents the employees in the larger centres — I'd assume that they'd be CUPE (Canadian union 

of Public Employees), but I don't know. 

 

Hon. Mr. Embury: — Basically, CUPE. These were a result of consultations with the urban administrators' 

association, with SUMA, and with the cities. And this was as a result of ongoing consultations in the Act that 

was passed last spring, and they brought these things to light. As you know, the Act was quite extensive, so this 

is simply to clean up some of those areas that perhaps were worded vaguely or incorrectly, and the wording 

wasn't the intent that was meant in the first place. But there is no policy change here. 

 

Clause 5 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 6 to 17 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 18 

 

Mr. Shillington: — This is an interesting provision. Is it new that an owner of farm land . . . If not, what 

change is being affected by this? 

 

Hon. Mr. Embury: — Mr. Chairman, this section is not contained in the new Act but was contained in the old 

Act, and it was thought at the time that we could eliminate this in light of the new five-year abatement section. 

However, it was discovered afterwards that there are some 200 existing agreements in Saskatchewan between 

municipalities and farmers, so rather 



 

December 19, 1984 

790 
 

than have all of these agreements voided, we decided to just retain this section in the new Act that was in the 

old Act. 

 

Clause 18 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 19 to 23 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 24 

 

Mr. Shillington: — It was not actually about section 24. I was rising to ask about section 25, and perhaps I 

better let you get the consent on it before I . . . I'm sorry. 

 

Clause 24 agreed to. 

 

Clause 25 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Twenty-five is retroactive to November 1, 1984. What's the reason for that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Embury: — Mr. Chairman, that was the date of proclamation. 

 

Clause 25 agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 10 — An Act to amend The Environmental Management and Protection Act 

 

Hon. Mr. Hardy: — Mr. Chairman, I'd like to introduce the assistant deputy minister, Bill Howard. 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Mr. Minister, our critic for this Bill is absent unavoidably, and I think that's to be 

understood given the rather unusual sitting — nature of this session. 

 

Could you outline for our benefit what changes are being effected by this Act? I'm not asking for your entire 

second reading speech again, but I'm particularly interested in section 5 at the moment. Could you outline for 

my benefit what changes are being effected by section 5? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hardy: — Well, Mr. Chairman, what it does, section 5 exempts industrial effluent from the 

permitting use, provided it's put into municipal sewage systems, where it's already regulated under a permit 

system. So it just does away with a duplication system, provided it's put into the municipal system. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — And who regulates it if it's put into the municipal system? What level of government does 

that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hardy: — The Department of Environment does. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — The Department of the Environment. Just to be — just to be sure there is no lessening of 

the ability of the department to regulate the discharge of industrial effluent, you are simply telling us that you 

are eliminating a duplication in legislative powers granted to your department. 

 

Hon. Mr. Hardy: — First of all, the city doesn't hook it up into any industrial system — into their system — 

without our approval, first of all, and this just does away with the duplication of 



 

December 19, 1984 

791 
 

two-permitting systems. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 2 to 8 inclusive agreed to. 

 

Clause 9 

 

Mr. Shillington: — I thought I heard you call — I have difficulty in hearing you. I thought I heard you call 

section 9, Mr. Chairman. 

 

Again, a question, Mr. Minister, as to why this is retroactive? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hardy: — Well, Mr. Chairman, in answer to the question, a lot of things happen in environment that 

we don't know about sometimes till after the fact, and if something has happened, or could have happened, we'd 

like to be able to, if needed, to lay a charge. And so, it protects the environment in a way that — in a retroactive 

way. So, in other words, if we had to lay a charge, finding out after the fact. That's what charges are all about, 

anyway. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Are you saying that you're making it retroactive so that you can lay a charge under a law 

— are you saying that you're making it retroactive just in case you miss something? Because if that's what 

you're saying, you're skating very close to being contrary to the charter of rights, if that's what you're really 

doing. 

 

Hon. Mr. Hardy: — Just to clarify that, my official says that when we passed the new water Act last spring, 

there was a permitting system out there, and there was some uncertainty as to the validity of the continuance of 

that regulation or that permitting, and we wanted to be sure that it's valid. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Might perchance July 1st, '84 have been the date you proclaimed that Act? 

 

Hon. Mr. Hardy: — That's correct. Yes. 

 

Clause 9 agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 20 — An Act to amend The Critical Wildlife Habitat Protection Act 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, I have a couple of questions here, and I'll ask them on clause 1. 

 

Mr. Chairman: — Order, order. 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Mr. Chairman, I'd like to introduce my officials. On my left here is the assistant 

deputy minister, Doug Cressman, and immediately behind me is the acting director of wildlife, Wayne Pepper. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, in some of your changes here, you've got one in section 6(2) that was the existing 

provision in the Bill. Now you say that that proposed amendment recognized the authority of persons other than 

the minister, the minister's assigned responsibility for this Act, to dispose of an interest in Crown land. 

 

Mr. Minister, are you saying that no longer does the minister have to okay any disposal of Crown 



 

December 19, 1984 

792 
 

land, and that anyone designated by him, or someone within the department, can do that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — The reason for this change is: before, the Minister of Agriculture could dispose of all 

Crown lands. He can dispose of Crown lands under the Department of Agriculture now, and we can do 

whatever, by way of minister's order, what we want to do with critical wildlife designated land. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, are you saying that now . . . Before, the minister had to okay any disposal or 

disposition of land, and now you're saying that the minister no longer has to approve any disposition of Crown 

land, or wildlife habitat land — that someone else can do that. 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — The land that is designated as critical wildlife habitat will not be sold. So in fact, a 

minister's order will not be signed on any of these lands. They will be retained as critical wildlife habitat under 

the Act. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, what is the purpose of this amendment to the Act, to have someone other than the 

minister . . . And the existing provision is that: 

 

Subject to subsection (1), the minister may only dispose of an interest in critical wildlife habitat lands whose 

disposition is permitted in the regulations . . . 
 
And that's part of it. I won't continue with all of it. But the explanation for the change is that the proposed 

amendment recognizes the authority of persons other than the minister assigned responsibility for this Act to 

dispose of an interest in Crown lands. So what this is saying to me is that the minister no longer has to approve 

the disposal of wildlife habitat land, but that someone else could actually dispose of portions of that wildlife 

habitat land. 
 
(1815) 
 
Hon. Mr. Pickering: — I would like to tell the hon. member from Pelly, Mr. Chairman, that any land that is 

put under The Critical Wildlife Habitat Protection Act cannot be sold. But other ministers could be involved 

here, as it relates to oil and gas exploration and so on, in which we would be responsible for giving them 

permission to go on such lands. 
 
Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, you're confusing this even more than what this Bill did. You are saying that 

somehow other ministers are going to be involved in some of that land regarding oil exploration or other uses 

that you may have for it. Other ministers may be involved, somehow. 
 
Are you saying also that if it's a gravel pit that you would want on some of this wildlife habitat land that the 

Minister of Highways would be able to approve the sale of a portion of that land in order to get a gravel pit out 

of it or something like that? Is this what you're saying, Mr. Minister? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Yes, I think you're in clause 7 here now. Whereas before the list he couldn't even build 

a new fence; he couldn't put a dug-out on this land. And some lands that are designated as critical wildlife 

habitat — there was gravel pits — would give us permission to let the Department of Highways or R.M.s 

continue to extract gravel and have access roads to those pits and so on. 
 
Mr. Lusney: — So actually, Mr. Minister, what this Bill is doing then is making it easier for different 

departments to have access to wildlife habitat land for whatever uses they may have on it, be it Agriculture, be it 

Department of Highways, or be it Saskoil or any other oil company, or whoever might want access to that land. 

The minister responsible for that department then can allow that to happen without it having to go through the 

minister responsible for this Act. 
 
Hon. Mr. Pickering: — No, that is not true. They would have to come to the minister responsible, to get 

permission to get access to the lands. Originally, in the Act passed last spring, 



 

December 19, 1984 

793 
 

no improvements of any kind could be made, such as I mentioned — fence posts, dams, dugouts, or anything, 

could be made. 

 

It was an oversight that we are just amending here so that we do have access. And, needless to say, the critical 

wildlife habitat protection lands still will be held by numerous lessees throughout the province who will 

continue to use them for agricultural purposes, such as grazing cattle and so on. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Well then, Mr. Minister, what would the purpose be of assigning someone else the 

responsibility to dispose of an interest in this land? 

 

If you say that whoever wants to have access to this land — be it another minister or whoever — still has to 

come to you for approval, why would the clause in here be, the amendment be, that someone other than the 

minister can be assigned responsibility through this Act and dispose of an interest in Crown land? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Mr. Chairman, what this says, that other ministers have the authority to dispose of 

Crown lands under the lands Act. And this will not give them that authority. They would have to go through the 

minister responsible for Parks and Renewable Resources. 

 

An Hon. Member: — . . . (inaudible) . . . where it says that? 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Yes, Mr. Minister, could you please say, or indicate, where in this Act it says that they cannot 

dispose of that land? 

 

You're saying now that other ministers have the authority to dispose of Crown land. Now we're talking about 

wildlife habitat land. And it says in here that the original or existing provision had to go through the minister in 

order to allow any changes to be made, or any disposition of said lands to be made. 

 

Now you're saying your amendment does not require the minister to do that. It could be any other person 

authorized to do that. Any other person authorized by your department can dispose of portions of this wildlife 

habitat land. And yet you're saying that that is not the case. Somehow you're protecting that from happening. 

And somewhere in this Act it would have to say that. Could you please indicate where it says that? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — What it says is: if the Minister of Agriculture was wanting to dispose of some Crown 

land which we had designated as critical wildlife habitat, he would have to go through this Act — this 

amendment — in order to do so, which gives the minister responsible the authority to say no, or yes, or 

whatever. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, you are saying that the minister now has to go through you to be able to dispose 

of some of the land, or have use or access to some of the wildlife habitat land. Well I ask, Mr. Minister, where 

in this Bill it indicates . . . what clause in the Bill would indicate that this is the case? Because in your 

amendment, to me, it seems to indicate that you as the minister no longer have to give approval; that someone 

else can give that kind of approval. And I would like to know where in the Act it states that the approval has to 

be given by the minister. 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Maybe, Mr. Chairman, I should read in the existing provision and what we are 

amending. The existing provision under section 6(2) empowers the minister to dispose of an interest in, i.e. 

lease, critical wildlife habitat lands within the framework of the other provisions of The Critical Wildlife 

Habitat Protection Act and its regulations. 

 

The new provision, section 6(2), is to be replaced by one which recognizes all authority empowered to dispose 

of interests in Crown land except those acting pursuant to The Mineral Resources Act. The new provision will 

also give power to both the cabinet and the minister to 



 

December 19, 1984 

794 
 

permit dispositions of critical wildlife habitat lands and will incorporate several minor wording changes. 

 

The original subsection 6(2) is too narrowly worded, as it fails to recognize the authority of the people other 

than the minister or ministers assigned responsibilities for the Act, i.e. for an example, Saskatchewan Water 

Corporation, to dispose of interest in Crown land. 

 

It is not intended, however, to infringe on the authority conveyed by The Mineral Resources Act. Mineral rights 

holders must still seek a surface lease whose disposition will be subject to The Critical Wildlife Habitat 

Protection Act and its regulations. 

 

The difficulty of anticipating all acceptable dispositions dictates the minister be given authority to authorize 

dispositions not identified in the regulations. 

 

Does that answer your question? 

 

Mr. Lusney: — It really doesn't, Mr. Minister. It's not in your explanatory notes, and I was going by what 

you've got in your explanatory notes here. You are reading something slightly different than what you sent 

across with the Bill. 

 

Now I find some difficulty in trying to understand just what it was you were saying, because you seem to be 

saying that you can designate another person — and that's what your explanatory notes say here — another 

person. You can designate the authority to someone else to dispose of this land. And this is what you just 

concluded with in your remarks, that you, as a minister, can give the authority to someone else to dispose of 

portions of that land. Is this not what you were saying? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — I think there's confusion here. None of this land is for sale. It's all leased. So none of it 

will be sold. You are talking about selling land. We are not selling land. We are protecting land under The 

Critical Wildlife Habitat Protection Act, and it will be all just leased land or lands that do not have a lessee, 

such as in the sand hills north of Sceptre and in that area. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, I wasn't necessarily talking about selling land. I understand you're not going to 

sell it. You will dispose of portions of that land via lease or what have you, and I would suggest it will probably 

be lease, nothing else. If you sell anything, it might be selling a mineral off that land, for instance, like gravel. 

That's what you would be using that for if you decided to do that. So it would be leasing it to someone else 

either for grazing, or for whatever means it may be, or selling a mineral off that land. And you are not going to, 

except through regulations, regulate who is going to give authority for it. 

 

Are you, as the minister, going to give all authority for any of this kind of disposition of portions of that land, be 

it mineral or leases on it, or are you going to designated, as your explanation here says, or your notes say, that 

you will designate someone else other than the minister to have authority to do this? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — No. Only the minister has the authority on what happens on these critical wildlife 

habitat protection lands. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Thank you. Mr. Minister, our concern is that ministers other than the minister, other than 

yourself, might in some way grant a permit to injuriously affect critical wildlife habitat — and I'll tell you, we 

don't want that. The last thing we want is the Minister of Energy being given the power to tell an oil company to 

move a big rig into a critical wildlife habitat and chew it up, because with all dues respect to his abilities — and 

they are many — he will see his function as that of promoting and working with the oil industry, not protecting 

the critical wildlife habitat. And if what you say is true, that any minister is going to be able to hand out these 

permits and tear them off a pad, then you've got us concerned. 



 

December 19, 1984 

795 
 

(1830) 

 

It is one of the values of having the minister in charge of this area do it, and not all ministers, is that you then 

ensure that the primary concern is the protection of the habitat and not the interests of the oil company, or 

whoever else might designate them. 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — I think you're confusing the thing here. Let's face it. For the last 20 years, 

Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation and the natural history society has been asking for this. Finally we have a 

government that's recognizing that we have lost over 50 per cent of the critical wildlife habitat in the south half 

of the province, and what this amendment does: the minister responsible for parks and renewable resources is 

the only one that can give authority to anyone on these lands, whether there is extraction of gravel, whether it is 

seismic crews, or whatever. It must be by way of minister's order. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Well, Mr. Minister, why would you want an amendment in this Act? And I will read you the 

exact quotation that you have in your explanatory notes here, and it says: 

 

The proposed amendment recognizes the authority of persons, other than the minister or ministers assigned 

responsibility for this Act, to dispose of an interest in Crown land. 

 

Why would you want to have, or to give someone else the authority, other than the minister, to dispose of an 

interest in that land? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Under this Act we're recognizing that the Minister of Agriculture, under the Provincial 

Lands Act, has the authority to dispose of Crown land. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Of Crown land, but not of wildlife habitant land. Those are two different things. Now, you are 

making an amendment to the critical wildlife habitant Act, and you are saying that the minister does not have to 

give authority, under this Act, to dispose of an interest in Crown land. 

 

I can understand the Minister of Agriculture disposing of Crown land, but it's designated as wildlife habitat, 

then I would think that the minister would be the only one responsible for any disposition of an interest in that 

land, and not necessarily say that anyone else could have that kind of authority. 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — The Minister of Agriculture can't dispose of any lands unless it is subject to the 

amendment in the Act. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, that was the case previously. The minister was the only one that could authorize 

that kind of disposal of an interest in that land. That was the existing provision, or that is the existing provision 

now. You are proposing an amendment where it is no longer the minister that has to give that kind of authority. 

But you say that someone, that someone that is authorized to do that could give that kind of authority to dispose 

of an interest in that land. Why do you need that amendment if you are saying that it is only the minister that 

can authorize any kind of disposal within the land? Why not leave that same section that's in there now? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Okay. For an example, we couldn't, the Minister of Energy and Mines, couldn't 

dispose of his interests in the land, because we're interested in the surface, and he's interested in what's 

underneath that. And just keep in mind that none of this land will be sold. Once it's put under the Act, the only 

way any can be taken out is it has to hit the floor of the legislature here, and we have identified somewhere in 

the neighbourhood of 2 to 3 million acres. 

 

Mr. Lusney: — Mr. Minister, the longer you take in answering these questions, the more suspicious I get that 

there is something in it that we don't know about. 



 

December 19, 1984 

796 
 

Now I understand, Mr. Minister, that you are not going to be selling it, and that if the minister of resources is 

interested in any of that land it would be because of what is — or the minerals that are on that land. I am saying, 

Mr. Minister, why do you require an amendment in the Act that would allow someone other than yourself to 

approve either the minister of mineral resources or the Minister of Highways access to that land? Why do you 

need a person other than yourself to do that? Why don't you leave it as the provision existed before, that stated 

it's the minister who gives that kind of authority and not someone else that may be given authority to dispose of 

portions of that land? 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Mr. Chairman, the way the amendment read before, the Minister of DPRR 

(Department of Parks and Renewable Resources) would have to issue the leases, and we're not into issuing 

leases on crown land that is going to be used for agricultural purposes. 

 

By changing this, means the Minister of Agriculture will continue to administer the grazing leases but only 

under the terms of The Critical Wildlife Habitat Protection Act, to prevent clearing and breaking and so on, that 

will destroy such lands under the Act. 

 

Clause 1 agreed to. 

 

Clauses 2 to 7 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Hon. Mr. Pickering: — Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my officials for their assistance getting this 

Bill through the legislature. 

 

Bill No. 24 — An Act to amend the Statute Law

Mr. Shillington: — It would be satisfactory to the opposition to proceed with this thing page by page. It's not a 

long Bill but it doesn't seem necessary to read out each section. 

 

Page 1 agreed to. 

 

Pages 2 to 5 inclusive agreed to. 

 

The committee agreed to report the Bill. 

 

Bill No. 25 — An Act to provide for the Postponement of the Tabling of Certain Documents 

 

Clause 1 

 

Mr. Shillington: — To whom are these questions address? The House Leader? The question concerns the 

tabling of the Public Accounts, and I really have a fear. I know it was discussed earlier in the question period, 

but it was somewhat abbreviated for my liking. My fear is that we're not going to get the Public Accounts for a 

period of time. Thereafter the Provincial Auditor has to review the same and prepare his report; public accounts 

can't start its work in the spring until we get the Report of the Provincial Auditor. My fear is that the work of the 

public accounts is going to get backed up because this isn't ready. I understand, Mr. Minister, that it's not ready 

because the public accounts aren't complete. That's hard to believe in the 20th of January . . . sorry, the 19th of 

January. But that's what I understand is that the public accounts aren't finished. 

 

I'd like, Mr. Deputy House Leader, as firm a date as you can give us as to when you think the 



 

December 19, 1984 

797 
 

Public Accounts might be in our hands. because after the occurs, there's still a lengthy delay . . . (inaudible 

interjection) . . . I wish I believed that — in the Provincial Auditor preparing his report, and then the Public 

Accounts Committee can't start their work until they get the Provincial Auditor's report. So it is a concern to us. 

 

Hon. Mr. McLeod: — Well, Mr. Chairman, I concur with the concerns raised by the opposition member. As it 

was discussed today in question period, Public Accounts will be available to all members of the House early in 

the new year, as the member for Revenue and Financial Services said. We will make every attempt, and we 

believe that we can have the Public Accounts in your hands by the end of January. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — All right. I'll take the minister's assurance that January 31st seems to be a realistic date, but 

I'll tell you, we're going to be awful unhappy if it's a great deal later than that, because public accounts will not 

get its work completed. 

 

I want to just ask the minister, as well, why you need 45 days. It seems to me to be an undue length of period. 

We had a problem last year with the annual reports coming streaming in at the 45th day. And it meant that the 

work . . . Yes, we had a fair number of them which were coming in at the last hour. And the difficulty we have 

with it is that we need these annual reports to prepare for estimates, for public accounts, and for Crown 

corporations. If we don't have them, the work of the legislature gets set back. Why can't you have them ready 

within 15 days of the opening of the new session? Why such a lengthy period of time? 

 

Hon. Mr. McLeod: — Mr. Chairman, I know what the member is saying, and I totally agree with what he says 

in terms of the annual reports. 

 

(1845) 

 

I don’t believe that it is the case that there were a stream of annual reports coming to . . . as it approached the 

45th day last year, when we had a similar Bill, in fact, an identical Bill that went through the House. 

 

There will be some documents that come later. I don't know which ones they are, but we know that to be the 

case. That's tradition, and they don't always hit the Table as early as any of us might like. 

 

But the undertaking that I gave to the Leader of the Opposition earlier in debate on this Bill was that it is not our 

intention to unduly hold the documents, the tabling of documents, and certainly there will not be a stream of 

documents coming to you in those last days. And they'll come as they become available in the session as we roll 

along. 

 

I would give you my undertaking that that would be the case. 

 

An Hon. Member: —That's meaningless. 

 

Mr. Shillington: — Yes, it really is meaningless, Mr. Minister. 

 

Much of this is not done by the members of Executive Council, but by the bureaucracy. My fear is, if you give 

them 45 days after the opening of the new session, which is the end of April, a goodly number of them are 

going to take advantage of that, as they did in previous years. 

 

And I would feel a lot more comfortable if you said 15 days. my guess is that most of them would make it. If 

you say 45, the departments may not get them in till the 45th day. So I really wish you would shorten the time 

limit down. 

 

Hon. Mr. McLeod: — Without getting into a long debate on this, I would say that, in this

particular government, the Executive council members do have a good deal to say about what things happen in

But in any case, I've given you the undertaking, and it would stand.

Hon. Mr. Devine: — Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to extend to you, and to all members of 

the House, to the Clerk and all the officials of the Legislative Assembly, indeed to all our officials who have 

worked very hard during 1984, and extend the same greetings and good wishes to the media who have joined us 

throughout the year. And I would just like to say that, from the members of this side of the House, we wish you 

and to all members of the Legislature that are elected, or appointed, or who attend and write and talk and visit 

about us, a very Merry Christmas. 

 

I'd like to say that it's been an eventful year, particularly in this Assembly. We have had some interesting 

events. We have had some positive. We have had indeed, some tragic, but certainly those that we will not 

remember, both positive and negative. 

 

On behalf of everybody here, I would like to say Merry Christmas to you and to all members of the legislature, 

and, sir, may all your dreams come true in 1985. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Blakeney: — Mr. Speaker, may I join with the Premier in extending the warmest, best wishes to all 

of those that the Premier enumerated, to our colleagues here in the legislature, to our staff. In the spirit of 

charity for the seasons, we'll not express any reservations in extending that same greeting to the press. 
 
And I say to those who may not be of the Christian faith, greetings, compliments of the season, and I add to the 

staff, those who may have missed the meal, we have some extra sandwiches in our lounge, compliments of the 

member for Rosthern. 
 
Thank you very much. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. McLeod: — Mr. Speaker, I move this House do now adjourn.
