present. 
 
Mr. Hillson: — Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker, again this afternoon 
it is my unhappy duty to rise with petitions from citizens of 
Saskatchewan deeply concerned about the collapse of our health

about the impending closure of yet more health services in the 
province. Your petitioners this afternoon come from the 
communities of Ituna, Hubbard, Homefield, and Kelliher. 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I also rise with 
my colleagues on behalf of concerned citizens with respect to 
the health care system in the province of Saskatchewan, 
particularly with the closure of the Plains Health Centre. And 
the petitioners on these documents, Mr. Deputy Speaker, are 
from Waldron, Ituna, Stockholm, Melville, and Yorkton. I so 
present. 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy 
Speaker. I rise once again to present petitions on behalf of 
citizens who are seeking justice for men and women who have 
lost loved ones in work-related accidents. 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 
Assembly may be pleased to have the Workers’ 
Compensation Board Act amended for the disenfranchised 
widows, widowers of Saskatchewan whereby their

reimbursed to them retroactively and with interest, as 
requested by the statement of entitlement presented to the

Assembly may be pleased to cause the government to 
reach necessary agreements with other levels of 
government to fund the twinning of the Trans-Canada 
Highway in Saskatchewan so that work can begin in 1998, 
and to set out a time frame for the ultimate completion of 
the project with or without federal assistance. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
These all come from the community of Prelate. They’re from 
St. Angela’s Academy in south-west Saskatchewan, Mr. 
Speaker.

following question: 
 

To the minister for SaskTel: is SaskTel exempt from 
challenges in small claims court; if so, by what authority; 
is there a time limit for farmers to collect crop and related 
damages from SaskTel? 

 
And I so present, Mr. Speaker. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 

Mr. Osika: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Mr. Deputy 
Speaker, I’m very pleased this afternoon to introduce to you and 
through you to the rest of my colleagues here in the Assembly 
and to everybody, 54 students from St. Henry’s Junior High in 
Melville, Saskatchewan sitting in the east gallery, Mr. Deputy 
Speaker, accompanied by their teachers, Garth Gleisinger and 
Brad Thompson. Welcome. Teacher aid, Mrs. Lynette 
Unterchute and bus drivers Kim Herbert and Lisa Lovelace. 
 
I’ll be meeting with these fine-looking young people at 2:30, 
Mr. Deputy Speaker. I’d ask everybody to welcome them here 
to the Assembly today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Murray: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It certainly is 
a pleasure to see so many visitors in the Chamber today and we 
welcome all of them, but I would particularly like to welcome, 
on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of Economic 
Development, a group of students seated in the west gallery. 
They are a group of 21 students from the Kelsey campus of 
SIAST (Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and 
Technology) and they are enrolled in the Grade 12 adult 
upgrading class. They are accompanied by their teachers, 
Rebecca Lasby, Donna Foulds, and Mark Magnuson. 
 
And I look forward to meeting with them later and will be 
anxious to hear their comments on what they think about the 
proceedings. Please join me in extending a warm welcome. 
Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We have a large 
number of special guests in the House today. And with the full 
House they are separated into both the east and west galleries. 
So I am going to ask them to stand when I call their names.

Vera McKay, Ellen Keewatin, Clara Gibson, Renée Geddes, 
Jason Morrisseau, Frank Gibson, Kevin Daniels, Shannon 
Huntinghawk, Millie Hotomai, Cammy Keewatin, Laurel 
Geddes, Lonnie Geddes, Evelyn Bitternose, Robin Geddes, and 
Billy McKay. Welcome to the legislature. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Whitmore: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I would 
like to, through you and to you, to the members of the 
Assembly introduce, sitting in your west gallery today, 53 grade 
5 students from Silverwood Heights School. And 
accompanying them today are their teachers, Ms. Barbara 
Wright and Ms. Doris Ritter. Chaperons Ms. Siemens, Ms. 
Milne, Ms. Hill-Hampson, Ms. Zerr and Ms. Doering. I would 
like the Chamber to welcome them today. I will be meeting 
with them at 2:30 to answer their questions and later we will 
have a photo. So again, I want to welcome the grade 5 students 
from Silverwood here today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy 
Speaker. I would like to introduce to you and through you to all 
members of the Assembly, some special guests in your gallery. 
And I ask each one of them to stand. Each one of these 
individuals has suffered a great loss. These are members of the 
disenfranchised widows and widowers of Saskatchewan. 
 
And I call upon Rose Polsom, Judy Millard, Zena Paquin, 
Eleanor Berg, Elmer Berg, Ruby Burlock, Pat Lang, Bernice 
McCabe, Juliane Frey, Laurine Davidson, Stella Mihalcea, Ruth 
Hordal, Joyce Babiak, Mary Aspen, Ruth Fahselt, Pat Gwilliam, 
Adeline Oystreck, Helen MacFarlane, Monique Fisher, Jean 
Martin, Jan Werbenuk, Shirley Oats, and Helen Schmidt. 
 
I ask everyone to please give them a warm welcome. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Murrell: — It’s my pleasure to introduce to you and to this 
Assembly, two constituents of mine from Unity seated in your 
gallery, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Ed and Betty Krips are visiting 
here, touring Saskatchewan, and enjoying their retirement. 
Please welcome them here. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 
Mr. Deputy Speaker, it is an honour and a pleasure to introduce 
to you and to all members of the House, a large group of grade 
12 students seated in your gallery, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 
 
This group of 38 grade 12 students come from the community 
of Canora. They are accompanied by their teachers, Mr. Larry 
Neufeld and Mr. Merv Tomski, and probably the most 
important person of the day, their bus driver, Mr. Don Probe. 
 
I know they have a busy day in the city of Regina and I’m glad 
to see that they’ve taken some time to come to the legislature 
and view the proceedings. And I look forward to the meeting 
with you immediately after question period. Thank you. 
 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I’d like to 
join with my colleague from Regina Qu’Appelle Valley in 
welcoming the students from Kelsey, many of whom would live 
in my riding. 
 
And also one of their instructors, Rebecca Lasby, because it just 
so happens that we attended law school together and next year 
will be the 20th anniversary of our graduation. And I didn’t 
know Rebecca was a teacher but I’m sure that when our 
classmates learn that I became a politician and she became a 
teacher, they will be very proud of Rebecca — and I welcome 
her today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I’m very 
happy, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to introduce to you and through 
you today a group of 24 students from Prelate, Saskatchewan, 
St. Angela’s Academy — one of the very few all-girl schools in 
our province. They are led today of course, by their teachers, 
Ms. Lana Steckler and Sister Pauline Reinhardt and I’m very 
happy that they’re here as well. 
 
I want you to know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the last time I 
visited with these young ladies they impressed me with their 
ability not to mince words when they give their opinion, 
basically on the unity of Canada question at that time. They 
were very forthright in telling us exactly how to run the country 
and what they thought about it. And I’m sure that they will 
learn more about the political process as they visit with us here 
today. 
 
I’d be happy to meet with them later, and hamburgers go with 
the drinks if you want them. So welcome to the Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Through you and to 
you, I’d like to join with my colleague from 
Kelvington-Wadena in welcoming her guests, and in fact the 
entire amount of guests we have today. 
 
But I want to especially welcome the aboriginal guests we have 
in the Assembly in both the east and west wing. I do want to say 
that I always take a special effort . . . make a special effort to 
welcome all the aboriginal people to the Assembly here. It’s 
very good to see that you are interested. 
 
And I must say that there are two aboriginal MLAs (Member of 
the Legislative Assembly) in the Assembly. And given the 
demographics and the population, we hope to see many more. 
And of course the one on this side is the better one. 
 
And I also encourage you to continue to take an interest in 
politics and good luck in your future. Thank you very much. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Mitchell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to join 
my colleague from Saskatoon Greystone in welcoming the 
group that she introduced, the disenfranchised widows. 



1116 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

When I learned they were coming today, which was at about 
11:30 this morning, we took steps to arrange a meeting room. 
And I want to take advantage of this opportunity to tell the 
group that if they want to meet me, I’ve arranged a room, in 
room 10, which is in the basement of this building. And I’d be 
pleased to meet them then. 
 
And I would like to add my welcome and those of my 
colleagues to their visit to the legislature today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 

Sporting Events in Regina 
 

Mr. Kasperski: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Mr. 
Deputy Speaker, this past weekend in Regina I was pleased to 
participate at the official opening of two sporting events here in 
the city. 
 
On Saturday morning I represented the minister responsible for 
sport, recreation and culture at Saskatchewan’s first provincial 
tournament for Sepak Takraw. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sepak 
Takraw, for those who have not heard, is a gymnasium sport 
which involves three persons per side which is played much 
like volleyball except you can’t use you hands or your arms. So 
it’s an interesting sport and was very entertaining. 
 
Congratulations, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to Mr. Rick Engel and 
the Asian sport, cultural and recreation society for bringing in 
this tournament and introducing this exciting sport here to 
Regina and to Saskatchewan. 
 
On Sunday, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I was pleased to represent the 
government at the official ceremonies for the opening of the 
38th season of the Columbus Baseball League. 
 
Congratulations should go out to Mr. Joseph Zerr, president of 
Columbus Park here in Regina, and the Knights of Columbus 
for their work and efforts in providing this program in the last 
38 years, which this year, Mr. Deputy Speaker, involves over 
900 baseball players at the mosquito, beaver, and midget age 
groups. Thank you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Free Vote to Save the Plains 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 
Last night the leader of the Saskatchewan Party attended a Save 
the Plains meeting in Moose Jaw, and it is becoming 
increasingly clear that the people of Saskatchewan want the 
Premier to allow a free vote on the future of the Plains. They 
want their elected representatives to stand in the House and vote 
for them on this very important issue. They want this, Mr. 
Deputy Speaker, because they know that if the members that 
they elected represented their concerns and not the government, 
they could save the Plains — that is the power of democracy. 
 
But instead, Mr. Deputy Speaker, those members chose to stand 
in this House and muzzle the democratic will of the people by 
cutting off the debate yesterday. Regina MLAs, including those 

from Victoria, Wascana Plains, Sherwood, Qu’Appelle Valley, 
and Dewdney, along with their rural counterparts from 
Weyburn, Swift Current, and Moose Jaw, refuse to take 
responsibility for this tragic decision by allowing a motion to 
save the Plains to come to a vote. Not surprisingly, many 
members, including five out of six Liberal members, chose not 
to participate in the vote at all. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, the members opposite can consider this their 
warning — they can run but they can’t hide. The Saskatchewan 
Party vows to hold the NDP accountable for this decision by 
putting forward this motion calling for a free vote on the future 
of the Plains every week until the end of session. And as a fine 
gentleman told the Minister of Health last night at the close of 
the meeting, close the hospital and the electorate will hold you 
accountable at the next election. 
 
Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Second Annual Youth Business Excellence 
Awards Ceremony 

 
Ms. Murrell: — Thank you. I would like to congratulate two 
young entrepreneurs in my constituency who were winners at 
the second annual Youth Business Excellence Awards 
ceremony recently held in North Battleford. The first place 
winner in the individual student competition was Amanda 
Frantic of Unity. Amanda runs a business called Frantic Snacks, 
which keeps the Unity Wheat Pool staff content with delicious 
muffin treats. Second place in this category went to Curtis 
Ferguson of the Highgate area west of Battleford. Curtis 
manages Ferguson Sheep Products and was also the winner of 
the award for successful problem solving. 
 
Sixty-three entries were judged by the North West Regional 
College business class, with first-place entries receiving $400 
prizes and second-place entries winning $200 prizes. The 
schools associated with each winner were also presented with 
plaques. These two young people are exciting examples of how 
imaginative, creative, and industrious our Saskatchewan youth 
are. They are also proof that there are areas of need in the 
market-place that can be identified and turned into a prosperous 
operation. 
 
I would like to wish Amanda and Curtis and all of our young 
entrepreneurs all the best in their business ventures, and 
commend them for their contribution to Saskatchewan’s 
economy. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Termination of Saskatchewan Party Researcher 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Mr. Deputy 
Speaker, for the sake of the Tory members who sit in this 
legislature I have some good news. I’ve learned there is no 
threat to labour peace at the Regina Leader Post and Saskatoon 
Star-Phoenix. Now you might ask why is this so important? 
Well on a daily basis the Tories have demonstrated that their 
research — it appears their only form of research — comes 
from our major daily newspapers. Every day in this House the 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1117 

Tories raise issues which are picked right from the headlines of 
the Leader Post and Star-Phoenix. 
 
But to give them some credit, they are attempting to address the 
situation. We learned yesterday that Mr. Hermanson, who had 
been hired as a researcher, was terminated before his probation 
was up. Oh, I’m sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I do apologize to 
the Tories for using the word probation. I know that is one word 
they don’t like to hear. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Waseca Residents Honoured for Volunteer Work 
 
Ms. Stanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Two Waseca 
residents, friends of mine, Helena Pike and Bob Douglas, were 
recently honoured by the Waseca Recreation Board for their 
volunteer work. 
 
Helena taught in Waseca from 1954 to 1981. Helena has always 
been community minded, but particularly active since her 
retirement. She’s helped to organize picnics, ice fun days, bike 
rodeos, walkathons, fall fairs, and homecomings. She really has 
done it all — from MC (Master of Ceremonies) to dishwasher, 
as one board member put it. Helena has also worked on the 
town’s history book and been a member of both the heritage 
committee and the historical society. 
 
Bob Douglas is also very deserving of public recognition for his 
volunteer work. Bob has been deputy mayor, served on the 
school board, been part of the 4-H beef club, the Kinsmen, 
K-40, was a little league coach, also a member of the Maidstone 
Housing Authority, and the credit union board, volunteer fire 
department, and the list goes on. Bob was also chairman of the 
Waseca Recreation Board for 14 years and a member for 17 
years. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to say that Helena Pike and Bob Douglas are 
dedicated, community-minded volunteers is an understatement. 
They have obviously given a great deal of time and effort to the 
community of Waseca and communities around Waseca, 
including Maidstone. I would like to add my voice to the many 
others who congratulate Helena and Bob on their dedication to 
the Waseca and Maidstone area. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Conduct of Chairman of Channel Lake Inquiry 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Mr. 
Deputy Speaker, as most members of the legislature know, it 
usually take a lot to make me blush. But my cheeks were red as 
ripe apples last week when I heard the chairman of Crown 
Corporations Committee use some pretty unfathomable 
language. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we all agree that the chairman’s words were in 
poor taste and very unprofessional, but strictly speaking it 
didn’t break any laws. 
 
However, I thought I better take this opportunity to warn that 
member to watch her step, and particularly her mouth, if she’s 
ever travelling . . . 

The Acting Speaker (Mr. Van Mulligen): — Order. Order, 
order. I don’t think that it’s appropriate for the member to 
question the conduct of any of the presiding officers during the 
course of members’ statements. The member and his colleagues 
will have recourse, if there are concerns about the conduct of a 
Chair or any presiding officer, to raise those issues and to raise 
those questions through substantive motion in the appropriate 
body; and in that case, it would be the committee in question. It 
is not appropriate to raise them in the way that the member has 
done. 
 

Remembrance Day Contest Winners 
 

Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 
Jonathan Hoddenbagh is a budding 14-year-old poet in my 
constituency. Jonathan was a runner-up in a nationwide poetry 
contest which was organized by the Royal Canadian Legion to 
commemorate Remembrance Day. Jonathan’s poem won first 
place in the zone, district, and provincial levels. His poem, 
entitled “So Much More,” beat out 500 poems from Meadow 
Lake schools alone, and as I said, he then went on to finish 
second nationally. 
 
Jonathan isn’t the only new literary and artist . . . literary figure 
and artist in my constituency. There were competitions for 
poetry, art work, and essays for three age categories in the 
legion’s Remembrance Day contest. 
 
Sherree Dallyn earned a first place finish at the zone level for 
her poster and a second place finish for her poem. Virginia 
Scissons also had a first place poster and first place poem at the 
senior level of the competition. Marlayna Rutzki placed first in 
the zone at the intermediate level for her poster. Alanna Warner 
finished first at the junior level for her poster. And Ashley 
Livingston finished first in the zone junior poem competition. 
 
Alana Singer, Kelsi Dalke, and Peter Weyenberg also did very 
well at the zone competitions. 
 
Mr. Deputy Speaker, I’d like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate all poets, artists, and essayists who competed and 
wish them the best of luck in developing their talents in the 
future. Thank you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Member Cited in Globe & Mail Article 
 

Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to rise 
today to members’ statements to make a statement of a very 
important part and cog of our caucus — a man that we have 
only known for a few short months, but we must pay tribute to 
today. And the man that we’re speaking about, nonetheless, is 
my hon. colleague from North Battleford, who has done a 
tremendous amount of work on behalf of the Liberal cause, and 
certainly on behalf of the Liberal caucus. 
 
And now his fame — his fame is now spread across the 
country, Mr. Speaker. And I quote from The Globe and Mail of 
May 7, 1998. 
 

Part of the reason (and the reason I refer to is the Liberal 
strength) . . . Part of the reason is that Jack Hillson, a 



1118 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

lawyer from North Battleford, is among the brightest and 
most articulate of MLAs, the only one who can match 
Premier Roy Romanow’s savvy and sophistication in 
legislative debates. 
 

Mr. Speaker, I think it’s very important that we realize that 
we’re amongst greatness in this caucus and that it’s very 
important to note that if you are down and out, to the member 
from North Battleford, we’ll offer you lunch. If you oppose 
him, do not give him a break because he’ll take away your 
lunch. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a colleague of mine, 
the member from North Battleford. Thank you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 

Release of Murder Suspect 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My question 
today is for the Minister of Justice. Mr. Minister, today in the 
legislature we are joined by the family and friends of Riel 
Morriseau. Riel’s life was cut short on Easter Sunday in a 
violent murder here in Regina. Not only has Riel’s family had 
to deal with this terrible tragedy, but his family and the families 
of the other victims who were assaulted are devastated and 
they’re living in fear. They believe the justice system is failing 
them. Like so many others, they see a revolving door justice 
system that pays more attention to the rights of the accused than 
the rights of the victim. 
 
Mr. Minister, after a Canada-wide manhunt by police, one of 
the accused, Rami Bellegarde, was arrested in Alberta, only to 
be released a few days later. He has now been re-arrested and 
charged with assault following an incident this past weekend. 
 
Mr. Minister, Riel Morriseau’s family has a question for you. 
Why was Rami Bellegarde released after being charged with 
second-degree murder and four cases of attempted murder? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you very much for that question. 
As the member well knows, there is no possibility that I can 
make any comment on a specific case. But what I can say is that 
we in Canada have a justice system of which we should be 
proud and it provides for the various checks and balances that 
are needed to deal with matters that are before the courts. 
 
And in this particular area there are many times that we need to 
look carefully at what the court has said and done and an 
attempt to deal with it that way. But our goal in this province is 
to have a justice system that works at protecting the public, and 
that’s the goal that we’re working toward. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Minister, I do understand that the decision 
to release accused murderers is ultimately the decision of the 
court. But there have been some very questionable decisions 
made in the recent days — the one in Melville the other day and 

now this one. 
 
The Manitoba Department of Justice recently took steps to 
address this problem by providing Crown prosecutors and the 
police with greater resources and more tools to oppose bail for 
serious, violent, and gang-related offences. These changes were 
announced on April 29. 
 
Mr. Minister, have you reviewed the steps the Manitoba 
government is taking to oppose bail for serious, violent 
offences, and will you implement similar procedures here in 
Saskatchewan so that accused murderers aren’t back on the 
street just days after their arrest? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — We work closely with our colleagues right 
across the country, and the various pieces of legislation that are 
introduced in other jurisdictions are reviewed carefully when 
they’re presented. We also look at the policies. 
 
What I would say is that here in Saskatchewan, we have 
announced in our budget this year, and I have made a number of 
ministerial statements about, the extra support that we’re 
providing to prosecutors and police to deal with serious crime, 
and especially as it relates to gang-related offences. 
 
And so we’re very proud of that initiative which we’re doing in 
cooperation with the police forces throughout Saskatchewan. 
We’re adding money to the prosecutions division to make sure 
that we have senior prosecutors working on the kinds of cases 
that you’re talking about. 
 
This government is very concerned about protection of the 
public and we will be continuing to do all of the things that we 
need to to support our police and our prosecutors. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Minister, the family of Riel Morriseau 
wants to make one thing very clear — the RCMP (Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police) and the city police are doing an 
excellent job. It’s the rest of the justice system that’s failing 
them. 
 
The RCMP issued Canada-wide warrants for the five accused 
murderers and they have arrested all five. They arrested Rami 
Bellegarde in Alberta. They brought him back to Regina and 
they brought him into the court. 
 
And our revolving door justice system put him back on the 
streets, only to be accused of another violent assault in just a 
few days. That’s a slap in the face for the RCMP; it’s a slap in 
the face to Riel’s family — to his mother, to his wife, and to his 
seven-year-old daughter. 
 
Mr. Minister, what procedures are you putting in place to make 
sure this doesn’t happen again? And what tools are you giving 
the police and the Crown prosecutors to help them oppose bail 
for serious crimes like murder? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1119 

Hon. Mr. Nilson: — As I explained previously, we have been 
putting money into the various things that are being done with 
the police and the prosecutors. We have a justice system in 
Saskatchewan which deals with many, many difficult cases on a 
day-to-day basis. And practically, what we need to do is 
continue to provide the support to our police, our prosecutors, 
and our courts, as they deal with some of the most difficult 
questions in our society. But it’s very clear that our 
government’s position and our main concern is protection of the 
public. And we will continue to work very hard at that 
objective. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Changes to Trucking Industry Policies 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My 
question today is for the minister responsible for Highways. 
 
Mr. Deputy Speaker, as we all know, Saskatchewan highways 
are in a state of disrepair. Many residents no longer feel our 
highways and our national . . . now a national organization is 
expressing its concern about this government’s intentions. The 
Canadians for Responsible and Safe Highways today issued a 
press release expressing concern about the NDP’s plans to 
allow semis with two 48- to 53-foot trailers on Saskatchewan’s 
two-lane highways. 
 
Mr. Deputy Speaker, while we certainly understand the 
economic reasons truckers would want this change, we are also 
concerned about the safety aspect. We are hearing of more and 
more accidents on Saskatchewan highways involving semis, 
including one recently in my own riding. 
 
Madam Minister, can you tell us if your department is planning 
on making these changes? 
 
Hon. Ms. Bradley: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m glad to 
have the opportunity to answer this question. One of the 
objectives which we’ve had in our transportation policy is to 
make sure that our highways are in the best of condition, but 
also to make sure that the vehicles and the trucking industry that 
is using that, that we do have good agreements. 
 
One of the pieces in which we are working on is trucking 
partnership agreements. And in that there will be allowed 
longer vehicles on some of our highways under certain 
conditions. These conditions will be then, where it’s concluded, 
to be on our two-lane highways, will be in restricted times 
between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. We’re working on this. We actually 
did a pilot study on this. And also at reduced speeds. And what 
that does is help remove the trucks from the busier times of day 
to a time when it will be safer, and both beat the economic 
advantage for the trucking industry but also helps to make our 
highways safer to the public using those highways. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Well, 
Madam Minister, safety is a prime worry for Saskatchewan 
residents, especially given the number of accidents on 
Saskatchewan highways these days. 
 

One can hardly blame them for being concerned when they hear 
semis with larger and larger trailers, larger than other provinces 
and the United States, are going to be allowed and are going to 
be appearing on our already crumbling highway system. 
 
Madam Minister, has your department conducted any studies 
regarding how this move will affect safety on our highways? 
And if not, why not? 
 
Hon. Ms. Bradley: — One of the factors in this was to keep the 
trucking industry competitive in the province, but also to make 
sure that our highways are as safe as possible. We, over the past 
18 months, we actually did a pilot project with Kindersley 
Transport. 
 
With that project, we released the study — and we had the 
approval of both CAA (Canadian Automobile Association), the 
Saskatchewan Trucking Association, and the department, and 
the trucking industry on this — and what the study showed, that 
during the 200 trips, there were no accidents and no complaints 
from the motoring public. 
 
And after, when we looked at the study, they suggested from 
the study that we should actually go from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. We 
actually then moved that back from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. to look at 
a time when the highways are not used as much. And these will 
all be under an agreement in which the record of the trucking 
firm will have to be looked at, all of the safety factors will be 
there. 
 
We’re talking about increased trucking in our province but to 
make that as safe as possible for the public. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Foster Parent Recruitment 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 
My question is for the Minister of Social Services or his 
designate. 
 
Mr. Minister, there was a very unusual ad in the help wanted 
section of the classified ads in today’s Leader-Post. It appears 
the Department of Social Services is advertising for foster 
parents for two teenage boys in the Leader-Post classified ads. 
 
Mr. Minister, this isn’t a couple of puppies you’re trying to give 
away here. It’s children. And we’re just wondering if this is the 
best way to find foster homes. 
 
Mr. Minister, is this a new procedure? Is this a good way of 
finding foster parents? And does this indicate that Social 
Services is experiencing a shortage of foster homes? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mrs. Teichrob: — Mr. Speaker, I thank the member 
opposite for his question and I will take notice of the question. 
 

Regina Hospital Bed Numbers 
 
Mr. McLane: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, today I 
have a couple of very simple questions for the Minister of 



1120 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

Health. Mr. Minister, the Atkinson report, which was released 
in April of 1992, concluded that the appropriate number of 
acute care beds for the city of Regina was 966. The study was 
conducted before your government closed down 53 rural 
hospitals, many of those in southern Saskatchewan, which has 
put even more pressure on the Regina system. 
 
My question, Mr. Speaker, to the minister, is can he explain 
why we have only two-thirds as many beds in Regina today as 
the Atkinson report recommended in 1992? 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, the language that we are 
prepared to use in public debate is very revealing as to our 
underlying motivation — whether we have a political axe to 
grind or whether we are truly concerned about the welfare of 
our fellow citizens. 
 
It’s been brought to our attention that on two occasions last 
night in Moose Jaw at the Liberal meeting, Darlene Sterling, 
sharing the platform with Dr. Melenchuk, other Liberals, and 
Elwin Hermanson, Leader of the Conservative Party, stated that 
it was “unfortunate that no one has died” because of health care 
changes. 
 
I am told that she went on to say that if someone had died as a 
result of health care changes, it would be easier to pursue the 
opposition agenda on health care. And I want to sincerely ask 
the Liberal Party, and the Conservative Party while I’m at it, 
this question: has your political agenda come to assume more 
importance than the lives and welfare of the people of this 
province? Do you feel it is unfortunate that no one has died 
because of health care changes and do you subscribe to this 
reprehensible and irresponsible point of view? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McLane: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Evidently the 
Minister of Finance doesn’t understand health care very well so 
I’ll ask him the question again. The Regina Health District’s 
Toward 2000 strategy also concluded there should be 764 acute 
care beds at the end of the consolidation process. Minutes from 
a January 1996 meeting of the board stated and I quote: “The 
district is targeting a total of 734 beds at the Pasqua and the 
Regina General Hospital sites at the time of closure.” 
 
Mr. Minister of Finance, can you explain to us then why we still 
only have 675 beds in the system today? 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if the 
Liberal Party understood care and compassion, the Liberal Party 
would, instead of engaging in fearmongering about health care 
day after day, tell the people the truth. The Liberal Party would 
tell the people that while there are 250,000 square feet in the 
Plains hospital, there are 480,000 square feet of hospital space 
that are being added to the Pasqua Hospital and to the General 
Hospital in the city of Regina. 
 
All of the staff and services at the Plains hospital will be 
consolidated into two locations, Mr. Speaker. None of the beds 
will be lost as a result of that consolidation. And I say to the 
Liberal Party, stop talking about being sorry that no one has 
died because of health care reform. Disassociate yourselves 
from those irresponsible statements. Stop fearmongering about 

health care, because I say to the Liberal Party and the 
Conservative Party this, Mr. Speaker: we have one of the finest 
health care systems on the face of this earth and . . . 
 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Van Mulligen): — Order, order. 
 
Mr. McLane: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Finance still won’t answer the question so I’ll 
give him the answer to the questions that I asked. The reason 
that we have 675 acute care beds in Regina today is because 
that is all this government is willing to fund. Bean counters 
from that government’s side have determined 675 is an 
appropriate number of beds. 
 
The number is not based on need or common sense, it’s based 
on dollars and cents. And what is the result? Day in and day out 
we hear that there are not enough beds in the city to serve the 
people of Regina and southern Saskatchewan. Mr. Premier, you 
continue to say there will be no fewer beds in the system if the 
Plains is allowed to close. But the fact remains there aren’t 
enough beds in the system now and the obvious solution is the 
Plains hospital. 
 
Free vote or no free vote, the only person with the power to halt 
the closure of the Plains is you, Mr. Premier. Will you swallow 
your pride, admit you made a mistake, and place a moratorium 
on its closure today. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — I want to ask the Liberal Party and the 
Conservative Party, Mr. Deputy Speaker, why this member, in 
response to my first response to him, has not disassociated 
himself with statements made on the Liberal platform in Moose 
Jaw last night, that it is unfortunate that no one has died in the 
health care system as a result of the government’s policies. I 
want to ask that member why Dr. Melenchuk, who is a medical 
professional, Mr. Deputy Speaker, along with Ms. Sterling, who 
is a registered nurse, why Dr. Melenchuk, who had the 
opportunity to speak several times last night after that statement 
was made, did not disassociate himself from that statement, Mr. 
Deputy Speaker. I want to ask the Liberal party when emotional 
rhetoric is going to end and rational discussion about health 
care is going to begin in this province, Mr. Deputy Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Workers’ Compensation Board Pension Benefits 
 

Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy 
Speaker. On April 8, I asked the Minister of Labour if his 
government will restore pension benefits to the Saskatchewan 
widows and widowers who lost their spouses in work-related 
accidents and then had their pensions denied because of 
remarriage. The minister replied that he was awaiting a report 
from the Workers’ Compensation Board, including an estimate 
of the costs involved, and that he would then take the matter to 
cabinet with a recommendation. 
 
Mr. Deputy Speaker, and Mr. Minister, since you now have that 
report in hand, including the actuary, it appears that the only 
hold-up is at the cabinet table. When will these widows and 
widowers get a definitive answer from your government? 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1121 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And the 
member will know that this is the third round we’ve had on this 
and that I have informally kept her informed of the progress of 
this particular file. She will know, because I told her, that we 
have now received the final actuarial numbers and the matter 
will proceed through government processes like any other 
decision, like any other policy decision of its type. 
 
I am not at liberty to tell the member, nor should I, whether or 
not it is at cabinet. I will tell her though that there is no attempt 
to slow-walk this. We are trying to push it through the system 
with as much dispatch as we can and we will be announcing a 
decision as soon as possible. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy 
Speaker. On April 27, the — 22nd, pardon me — the Minister 
of Labour stated, and I’m going to paraphrase this lengthy 
response. 
 
I’m awaiting a report from the Workers’ Compensation Board 
and the actuarial experts advising the board. When this 
information is in hand, we will decide on this important 
question of policy, and if it requires legislative amendment, 
then that will follow. 
 
Mr. Minister, this issue is about justice. This issue is about 
being honourable. This is about security for people, many of 
whom are elderly and are in need. Now please tell them 
specifics today, and assure them that if legislative amendment is 
required that it will occur in this session. 
 
Hon. Mr. Mitchell: — The member knows perfectly well when 
she asks that question what the answer has to be. It is a repeat of 
the answer I gave earlier. 
 
The government has the information in hand now. We have a 
process, as has any other democratically elected government, to 
decide policy issues and that process is being followed here 
with all due dispatch. I am not able to give her any undertaking 
about legislation or anything like that until the government has 
decided this important policy question. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. This 
government’s past behaviour has not eluded these widows. 
They worry that the government will do to them exactly what it 
did when it delayed and delayed and delayed settling with 
parents who had acted in accordance with the government’s 
own law and paid benefits to their babysitters. 
 
Mr. Minister, you said on April 8 that the Worker’s 
Compensation Board is, and I quote, “in a very strong financial 
position.” It took you a year — a year — for your government’s 
due dispatch to correct your mistake with the babysitters fiasco. 
 
You now have an opportunity to demonstrate that you can take 
more prompt action with the disenfranchised widows and 
correct a great wrong. 
 
Will you give much greater specifics, please. You don’t have to 

give a deadline. For goodness sake, just tell these people that 
what they were told in October and December and January and 
February and April is actually finally going to result in 
something. 
 
Hon. Mr. Mitchell: — Mr. Speaker, the member is obviously 
playing politics with this very important issue — obviously. 
She wouldn’t be coming at me over and over again with the 
same question in light of the answers that I have given. 
 
I have been as open and direct as I possibly can with respect to 
this issue. I have concealed nothing. If I had anything more that 
I could possibly say as a minister of the Crown, I would be 
saying it. The member knows that; other members of the 
legislature know it. A decision will be forthcoming as soon as 
possible. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Used Oil Recycling Charge 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My 
question is for the Minister of Environment and Resource 
Management or his designate. 
 
Mr. Minister, farmers across Saskatchewan are gearing up for 
another year. In many areas spring seeding is already under way 
or finishing. And one of the things farmers do in preparation for 
seeding is change oil in their trucks and tractors. Mr. Minister, 
that’s where we run into a problem — what do they do with the 
used oil? 
 
Last year the Saskatchewan Association for Resource Recovery 
announced a province-wide, used oil recycling program in 
conjunction with Sask Environment. The plan was to place an 
environmental charge on oil sales and then use the money to 
establish 30 recycling centres. Well, Mr. Minister, you’ve been 
collecting the money for eight months but we don’t see any 
recycling centres. 
 
Mr. Minister, how much money has been collected from the 
environmental charge on oil, and if the money isn’t being used 
to set up recycling centres, what are you doing with it? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. I’d be pleased to answer on behalf of the minister. 
 
As you will know, all people, whether in the agri business or in 
industry across this province, are very concerned and interested 
in how we manage recycling and how we manage our 
environment. And I think the farming community, it’s safe to 
say, is very much in tune with good environmental stewardship, 
whether it be the way they manage the cultivation of their land 
or whether they be involved in a recycling program with used 
oil. Mr. Deputy Speaker, I think it’s fair to say that the forest 
industry has become very much aware of the impact of used oil 
in the forest areas. 
 
The government is putting, and will continue to put, in place 
programs where recycling — whether it be oil or whether it be 
empty containers and cartons — we’re putting in place 



1122 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

recycling systems that will help to maintain and protect our 
environment. And I want to say that on behalf of the Minister of 
Environment, his department and he will continue to work with 
his department, with the agricultural sector and with industry, to 
ensure that we do the appropriate environmental stewardship 
here in Saskatchewan. 
 

Inquiry into Channel Lake 
 
Mr. Hillson: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I 
preface my remarks by saying to the Minister of Finance, my 
understanding is that the unfortunate woman last night made a 
slip of the tongue. She meant to say, it is fortunate no one has 
died, not unfortunate. And I don’t know why he has to make 
such a big deal about an unfortunate slip of the tongue. It’s been 
known to happen on that side too. 
 
Mr. Deputy Speaker, all of . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . 
Okay. Mr. Deputy Speaker, from day one we have been told all 
along, until yesterday, that Channel Lake was set up in order to 
supply SaskPower with natural gas. Yesterday we were told that 
in point of fact it has sold virtually no gas to SaskPower from 
day one, or ever, notwithstanding the fact that the gas fields are 
very close to the Many Islands’ pipeline coming into our 
system. 
 
What is going on? The government now has before us a Bill to 
lessen ministerial responsibility. Channel Lake happened 
because of a breakdown in ministerial responsibility. Will the 
minister confirm that what we need is not less responsibility but 
more? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, the member I think in 
vain tries to defend statements made at a meeting in Moose Jaw 
last night and I give him credit to trying to do that, but it’s a 
huge failure. And if I were you, sir, and running for leadership, 
I would stay out of that part of the issue. 
 
But I want to say as well that the committee, which was not 
supported by members of the Conservative Party in the initial 
stages, is I think, working very well. And there are many people 
in the public who are saying now, having watched the process 
— and I give credit to all members of the committee — are 
saying that in fact members of this legislature can do the kind of 
work that looks at an issue like Channel Lake. 
 
Now I say again to the member opposite, when you are writing 
your report based on the questions that have been asked, I’m 
sure that all of the issues that you would like to deal with will 
be included in that report. So I urge you again, be patient. Ask 
the questions, as you’re doing. And in the writing of the report, 
exercise your influence and make sure those kind of issues are 
included. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 41 — The Teachers’ Dental Plan 
Amendment Act, 1998 

 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
I’m pleased to outline the purpose and the main provisions of 
these amendments to The Teachers’ Dental Plan Act. The 
teachers’ dental plan is one of the topics covered by provincial 
collective bargaining for teachers. 
 
Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago Saskatchewan teachers ratified 
a new collective agreement for the period January 1, 1997 to 
December 31, 1999. The collective agreement includes a 
number of enhancements and revisions to the teachers’ dental 
plan. One of these changes requires an amendment to the 
statute, while the other changes do not involve the legislation 
but only the various plan documents. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the one substantial amendment to the Act relates 
to the point at which teachers become eligible for dental 
benefits. The amendments affect two groups of teachers. 
 
First, teachers on a continuing contract of employment will now 
be eligible to submit claims for dental plan benefits once 
they’ve completed 20 days of service rather than waiting 50 
days. 
 
(1430) 
 
Second, all teachers on a temporary contract will now become 
eligible for benefits, since 20 days is the minimum length of a 
temporary contract. Until now, temporary teachers have not 
qualified for benefits unless their contract was for at least 50 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1123 

teaching days. 
 
There are also a number of housekeeping amendments which 
simply update references to other statutes and incorporate 
general neutral language. 
 
As I stated at the start of my remarks, these amendments are 
needed to implement the provisions of the new collective 
agreement relating to the teachers’ dental plan. I’m therefore 
pleased to move, Mr. Speaker, that Bill No. 41, An Act to 
amend The Teachers’ Dental Plan Act be now read a second 
time. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Deputy, thank you — Mr. Deputy Deputy 
Speaker. Just a couple of comments in regards to the comments 
that the minister has made regarding Bill No. 41. 
 
We’ve looked at the Bill and in general we really don’t have a 
lot of problems with that. I think it basically meets some 
requirements, and the Bill basically brings the Act into line with 
a collective bargaining agreement. And we feel that we would 
have more than adequate opportunity to ask any questions, 
particular questions dealing with this, in Committee of the 
Whole; so we’re prepared to move this Bill forward. 
 
Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and referred to a 
Committee of the Whole at the next sitting. 
 

Bill No. 42 — The Teachers’ Life Insurance 
(Government Contributory) Amendment Act, 1998 

 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you. I’m pleased to outline the 
purpose and the main provision for these amendments to The 
Teachers’ Life Insurance (Government Contributory) Act. The 
teachers’ group life insurance plan is one of the topics covered 
by provincial collective bargaining for teachers. 
 
Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago Saskatchewan teachers ratified 
a new provincial collective agreement for the period January 1, 
1997 to December 31, 1999. The collective agreement 
incorporated the change to the teachers’ group life insurance 
plan which necessitates amendments to the statute. 
 
This change relates to the point at which teachers become 
eligible for coverage under the plan. Until now, teachers on a 
temporary contract of employment have not been eligible for 
coverage unless the contract was for at least 50 teaching days. 
This threshold is being reduced to 20 days. All teachers on a 
temporary contract will now become eligible for benefits, since 
20 days is the minimum length for a temporary contract. There 
are also a number of housekeeping amendments in the Bill 
which simply update references to other statutes. 
 
As I stated at the start of my remarks, these amendments are 
needed to implement the provisions of the new collective 
agreement relating to the teacher’s group life insurance plan. 
I’m therefore pleased to move that Bill No. 42, An Act to 
amend The Teachers’ Life Insurance (Government 
Contributory) Act now be read a second time. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Deputy Deputy Speaker. 

Regarding Bill No. 42, this again follows a lot of the 
agreements that have already been arrived at with the teachers 
and we are quite confident that we’ll have our questions 
answered at the appropriate time in Committee of the Whole 
and we’re more than prepared to move this Bill to committee as 
well. 
 
Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and referred to a 
Committee of the Whole at the next sitting. 
 

Bill No. 53 — The Teachers Superannuation 
and Disability Benefits Amendment Act, 1998 

 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased 
to outline the purpose and main provisions of this Bill for all 
members of the Assembly. 
 
This is the third of three Bills required in this session to 
implement provisions of the new provincial collective 
bargaining agreement for teachers. Bills dealing with the 
teachers’ dental plan and the teachers’ life insurance plan have 
already been introduced. 
 
The teachers’ superannuation is one of the mandatory items for 
negotiation in provincial teacher bargaining. Because most of 
the terms and conditions of the superannuation plan are spelled 
out in detail in the statute, any provisions or revisions to the 
plan invariably require legislative amendments. 
 
By way of background, Mr. Speaker, I should explain that there 
are two superannuation plans for teachers in Saskatchewan. The 
teachers’ superannuation plan administered by the Teachers’ 
Superannuation Commission applies to teachers who began 
teaching in the province before 1980. Teachers who have begun 
teaching since 1980 belong to the Saskatchewan teachers 
retirement plan, which is administered by the Saskatchewan 
Teachers’ Federation. 
 
The statute with which we are dealing today governs only the 
teachers’ superannuation plan and affects only the teachers who 
belong to the plan. The terms and conditions of the 
Saskatchewan teachers retirement plan are under the 
jurisdiction of the teachers’ federation and are not negotiated in 
provincial bargaining. 
 
The new 1997 to 1999 provincial collective agreement includes 
a number of provisions which require changes to the Act. These 
provisions can be divided into two main categories. First there 
are a series of provisions which were brought to the attention of 
the bargaining committees by the Teachers’ Superannuation 
Commission and which were subsequently agreed to in the 
negotiations. The amendments in this category address these 
three objectives. 
 
First, they ensure that the provisions of the Act are fully in 
compliance with the requirements of federal income tax 
legislation. Such compliance is necessary for the plan to 
maintain its registered status with federal authorities. For 
example, teachers will now be required to voluntarily withdraw 
their money from the voluntary contributions fund in the year 
they turn 69 rather than 71, because federal regulations 
governing registered retirement savings plans have been revised 
in this way. 



1124 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

Second, the amendments eliminate some anomalies and 
inequities in the existing rules and practices that the 
commission is required to follow in administering the plan. For 
example, there are currently circumstances in which the plan is 
unable to include interest when refunding a teacher’s pension 
contributions. There are also circumstances in which there is no 
authority to pay out all of the teacher’s own contribution and 
interest in the form of an allowance or lump sum payment. 
 
These problems are being corrected so that in all cases, the 
minimum amount that a teacher or the teacher’s family or estate 
will receive is the teacher’s personal contributions plus the 
interest on the? How busy is this department ofmendments in 
this category correct some errors and ambiguities that have been 
identified in the current wording of some divisions of the Act. 
 
The second major category and amendment in this Bill includes 
matters which were negotiated by the parties to address the 
interests of teachers and matters of mutual concern. I will 
identify the key amendments in this category. 
 
First, teachers will now be able to purchase up to one year of 
leave on a deferred salary leave plan for pension purposes. This 
new provision parallels existing provisions for the purchase of 
sabbatical leave, educational leave, and parenting leave. 
Teachers who wish to have deferred salary leave counted 
towards their pension will be required to make the appropriate 
contributions, which will be matched by the government in the 
usual way. In other words, the teacher will be treated for 
pension purposes as though he or she had been teaching during 
the period of time involved. This new provision will not affect a 
large number of teachers in that there is no provincial deferred 
salary leave plan for teachers and there have been relatively few 
at the local level. Nevertheless, where such arrangements exist 
or have existed, it is considered appropriate to treat the leaves in 
the same way as other leaves of absence for pension purposes. 
 
The second amendment in this category will benefit some 
teachers who cease teaching before they’re eligible for a 
pension. These teachers will now be able to transfer the 
commuted value of their future pension to a private retirement 
scheme instead of being required to leave their money in the 
superannuation plan. Given the structure of the plan, some 
teachers will find it financially advantageous to make use of 
this new provision. There is no additional cost to the plan itself. 
 
Finally, the rules regarding retired teachers who return to teach 
are being revised. At present, a retired teacher can teach up to 
120 days in any school year following retirement before any 
reduction is made in the teacher’s pension. The 120 day limit 
will remain in place with respect to the school year in which a 
teacher’s pension begins. However, for all subsequent years the 
limit is reduced to 60 days. The new rules are intended to reflect 
the balance of interests. On the one hand, boards of education 
will still be able to hire retired teachers for reasonable periods 
of time to meet short-term needs such as substitute teachers or 
temporary contracts if other teachers are simply not available. 
 
Sixty teaching days, which is the equivalent of three months of 
the school year, should cover the vast majority of cases. On the 
other hand, the new restrictions will help to ensure that retired 
teachers do not return to teach for unreasonable periods of time, 
thereby denying employment opportunities to young teachers 

beginning their careers. 
 
As I’ve indicated, Mr. Speaker, all of the amendments in this 
Bill are required as a result of the new provincial collective 
agreement with teachers. It is important that the necessary 
amendments be passed now in order that they’ll be in place by 
July 1, 1998, the date on which they take effect. 
 
I am therefore pleased to move, Mr. Speaker, that Bill No. 53, 
An Act to amend The Teachers Superannuation and Disability 
Benefits Act be now read a second time. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Deputy Deputy Deputy Speaker. 
It’s a pleasure to respond to the minister’s comments and the 
fact that here again we have a situation where the minister is 
addressing a number of concerns that have been brought 
forward as a result of provincial bargaining; and the fact that a 
number of the concerns that the minister is talking about, I 
know teachers, superannuated teachers, have chatted with me 
on a number of these issues, and I am pleased to hear and to see 
that the minister and her department are responding. 
 
It’s appropriate. It’s an issue that is very important, given I 
believe, the fact that superannuated teachers have the 
opportunity to take their pension and to manage it privately. It 
was important to some. To some it won’t be all that important. 
 
But the fact is that these three Bills before the Assembly this 
afternoon are addressing a number of concerns that have been 
raised by teachers for a number of years. And with that in mind, 
I don’t see why we should hold the Bills up. 
 
One of the things I really wanted to note, because it’s been 
raised on many occasions, is the fact that if a person takes a 
leave for a period of time, that they have the opportunity to 
make that contribution up and that their pension plan is not 
affected as long as they make the contribution. And I believe, as 
the minister indicated, this current Bill does make that 
provision. I think that’s appropriate. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, in regards to any particular questions 
regarding the Bill, I believe we can address those probably 
more accurately and appropriately in Committee of the Whole 
rather than debating an issue that most people generally agree 
with, especially the individuals who will be affected by the 
legislation before us. 
 
Therefore I suggest that we’re more than prepared to allow this 
Bill to proceed to committee. 
 
Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and referred to a 
Committee of the Whole at the next sitting. 
 

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 27 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Calvert that Bill No. 27 — The Public 
Service Act, 1998 be now read a second time. 
 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1125 

Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We have a number of 
concerns related to Bill No. 27, The Public Service Act, 1998. It 
allows for the Public Service Commission to delegate its 
responsibilities and its duties to whoever it likes with no 
significant oversight. It provides for affirmative action 
programs within the public service. At a time that it gives 
special privileges to other groups, it removes recognition for 
service for war veterans and I think that that’s something that 
we all should be very concerned about in this legislature. 
 
It gives unions a type of, or a sort of, veto over any regulations 
before they are passed. And again, I think that outside of the 
elected Assembly here, we should not be providing that kind of 
veto to anyone. It is the Assembly here that should be making 
the laws and not anyone else. 
 
We will want to review all negative aspects contained within 
this Bill in detail in committee before this Bill is passed, but 
we’ll ask those questions in the appropriate form, which is 
committee. 
 
Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and referred to a 
Committee of the Whole at the next sitting. 
 
(1445) 

Bill No. 29 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Mitchell that Bill No. 29 — The 
Workers’ Compensation Amendment Act, 1998 be now read 
a second time. 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. With respect to Bill No. 
29, The Workers’ Compensation Amendment Act, 1998 there 
are certainly — as all members of this legislature will know — 
a lot of concerns regarding the operations of the Workers’ 
Compensation Board, both from people who are injured on the 
job and from employers who pay the bills for Workers’ 
Compensation. 
 
I think within my office — and I suspect that my office is not 
unique, MLA office that is; I suspect that many, many members 
are dealing on an ongoing basis with the considerable number 
of Workers’ Compensation concerns — the file seems to grow 
larger and larger, rather than smaller and smaller, as it should 
be. 
 
Injured workers are a fact, unfortunately, of life. But 
nevertheless the Workers’ Compensation Board seems to have 
taken rather backward steps in dealing with some of these 
issues surrounding injured workers. We are constantly 
inundated within our opposition office, and I’m sure members 
opposite are the same way, about worker-related injuries in this 
province. 
 
First and foremost, any changes that are made to The Workers’ 
Compensation Act must in the end, promote both fairness for 
the injured worker and for the employer. A year or so ago we 
saw 52 recommendations brought forward by a review panel. 
This review . . . this legislation deals with very, very few of 
those recommendations that were brought forward. 
 
Among the things that it does, it enshrines the benefit of the 

doubt clause in the legislation, expands the definition of injury 
to include a disabling or potentially disabling condition caused 
by an occupational disease, increases lump sum annuity 
payments to $20,000 from the current $5,000, and offers 
pension contributions to surviving spouses who are currently 
receiving benefits. 
 
Many of the complaints that we get about the Worker’s 
Compensation Board deal with the WCB (Workers’ 
Compensation Board) refusing to take into consideration the 
word of a family doctor or other physician outside of the 
auspices of the WCB. Does the benefit of doubt clause have 
anything to do to remedy this situation? And we’re concerned 
about that. 
 
In the last few years, calls to our office from workers who find 
themselves now unfortunately involved in Workers’ 
Compensation through injury have increased significantly. 
Some of the people who call our office have been so 
discouraged by the treatment they have received that they have 
become convinced that, for whatever reason, the Workers’ 
Compensation Board has a vendetta against them. 
 
And you only have to look towards the rally that was held last 
spring down in the park downtown here, where Workers’ 
Compensation victims were coming forward and reciting story 
after story, concern after concern, about the plight of 
themselves and how Workers Compensation, the Workers’ 
Compensation Board, hasn’t been dealing with them in a 
straight-up fashion. And there’s lots of concern about this type 
of thing. 
 
While I don’t see that there are certainly any conspiracies 
against injured workers, I think it’s obvious to many who are 
caught in . . . that many are caught in a bureaucratic web. I 
don’t see very much, unfortunately, in this Bill that will go very 
far in reducing the bureaucratic tangle that some people are 
constantly finding themselves in when it comes to the 
operations of the WCB. 
 
We have to treat the Workers’ Compensation Board like every 
other support program. People should have access to it as long 
as they need it. They should be allowed to heal, but once they 
are healed they must be encouraged to go back to work. 
 
But there’s no question that, just like every other government 
program, some people become over-dependent on this one and 
there must be enough checks in place to ensure that they’re not 
abusing the system. But there also, at the same time, has to be 
the recognition that the Workers’ Compensation Board has 
outstanding, numerous files that need to be addressed. 
 
Employers must also be treated fairly. Never again should we 
see the massive increases in premiums like the ones we saw a 
few years ago. The board has gone some way in bringing about 
more sensible rate codes, but they have been for the benefit . . . 
that have been for the benefit of many, but not all employers 
find themselves in a favourable position. 
 
Many are worried that the continued expansion of what they see 
as Workers’ Comp covers . . . what it covers will continue to 
cause premiums to jump in the future. So-called grey areas such 
as stress is now being covered. I say I would think that it would 



1126 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

be quite difficult to prove that stress is necessarily caused in the 
workplace. This could prove to be very costly in the end if not 
handled very, very carefully. And we hope the government is 
paying attention to that issue that employers are bringing 
forward. 
 
The government has to be very careful when dealing with the 
expanded definition of injury. We do not want to see the 
Workers’ Compensation Board covering these things that are 
diseases of life and lifestyle but not caused in the workplace. 
One only has to look at injuries . . . or, pardon me, lifestyle 
diseases such as smoking and cancer that is often a part of a 
smoker’s life and somehow or another are associating that with 
a disease of the workplace. I think there has to be significant 
study into that issue before we carte blanche start offering 
compensation in that area. 
 
If we continue to move in this direction, we’ll see the amount 
the board pays out rise dramatically. Employers will have to 
pay for that cost, and that’s what causes the loss of jobs in the 
end. This will hurt employers and employees alike. So I hope 
that the minister responsible is paying a great deal of attention 
to life and lifestyle issues and how they impact or do not impact 
upon workplace injuries. 
 
There are also a number of concerns from people across this 
province about the Workers’ Compensation Board that we’re 
bringing forward and bringing our attention to in committee. 
We need many, many specific questions answered on this Bill 
before we are prepared to let it go forward. 
 
We’ll be asking those questions in the Committee of the Whole, 
and at this point we’ll allow the Bill to proceed to that 
committee where we’ll be asking those appropriate questions. 
 
Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and referred to a 
Committee of the Whole at the next sitting. 
 

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
 

Bill No. 38 — The Highway Traffic Amendment Act, 1998 
 
Clause 1 
 
The Acting Chair (Mr. Johnson): — Will the minister 
introduce his officials. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much, Mr. 
Chairperson. It’s with great pleasure that I introduce the 
officials who are kind enough to come and assist the Assembly 
in its work this afternoon. 
 
Seated to my right is Sherry Wolf, the very able assistant 
vice-president of licensing and registration services. To my left 
is Tim Shoulak, manager of Highway Traffic Board secretariat. 
And directly behind is Elizabeth Flynn, the legal assistant at 
SGI (Saskatchewan Government Insurance) legal. I welcome 
these officials today to help us with the Bill. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple of 
questions, because I think this Bill is fairly non-controversial. 
Some minor, non-controversial revisions are being made to the 
rules of the road. One, I believe, a clause enabling drivers to 

cross a solid line between lanes when utilizing the two-way, 
left-turn lane. And another section prohibiting a driver from 
driving in a two-way, left-turn lane unless he or she intends to 
turn left. 
 
Mr. Minister, maybe you could just give us a little bit of 
clarification as to what the intent of those are. I think I 
understand them to a degree, but maybe just for our own 
knowledge, just to fill us in exactly what you mean by those 
two changes. Thank you very much. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — The member has correctly described 
the effect of the Bills. I am told by the officials that — I think 
this is what the member wants — the problem intended to be 
resolved is the danger of rear-end collisions, and therefore the 
ability to cross the solid white line has been set up in 
legislation. I’m not sure if I’ve answered the member’s question 
or not. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Minister, maybe I 
could refer to . . . you may be familiar, if I’m thinking right, just 
on South Albert, and I’m not exactly . . . just by the Safeway 
and the Golden Mile, there’s a left-turn lane there. There is a 
solid line for probably half the block before the solid line moves 
and you can . . . I guess I’ve wondered about that myself. You 
know, you may have traffic already lined up past the solid line, 
but you have the left lane available for the left-turn arrow. Is 
that an area where you would say that it would be appropriate to 
cross and move into that left-turning lane? 
 
(1500) 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much. Now I am 
told that that is not an example of what it’s aimed at. Rather the 
member can contemplate the centre-turn lanes which are in the 
north by the auto dealers up there. The sign indicates a two-way 
left-turning lane and this legislation enables people to cross into 
the lane so they can get into the turning lane to turn. 
 
I think what I’m going to do is to table, and I’ll provide the 
member opposite with a copy of, a diagram of such a turning 
lane and an explanation of how it works. That may make more 
sense than trying to describe it without the benefit of a diagram. 
 
So if I could have the benefit of a page, I would ask you to table 
one copy and give one to the member from Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
Mr. Minister, in regards to the particular example I was 
thinking of . . . and I know where you are referring to as well. 
North Broad — been up there with all the car dealerships. There 
is a centre median that you can pull into and make left/rights 
out of, without basically . . . like you say, they are turning lanes 
so you are not hindering the traffic flow behind you. You’re off 
ready to make your turn and that the other lanes can continue to 
proceed. 
 
However in the situation that I’ve raised, if a person should 
cross . . . you’re going to be making the left turn. There is a 
left-turn lane but there is a solid line up to a certain point. If you 
pulled over, are you saying that that would be basically 
contravening the Act, if you pulled in ahead of time in order to 
be in the left-turn lane at that particular intersection, if indeed 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1127 

the through traffic lane is already full but there is opportunity to 
move in there? Is there any provisions here that would 
acknowledge that? Or would that be contravening the traffic 
Act to move . . . pull over on that solid line? 
 
The Acting Chair (Mr. Johnson): — Yes, what is it? 
 
Mr. Bjornerud: — By leave, Mr. Chairman, to introduce 
guests. 
 
Leave granted. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 

Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to 
introduce to you and through you and to the members today, 
Mr. Chairman, a group of 26 grade 12 students from 
Langenburg and their chaperons. I'd like to welcome them here 
today and I hope they enjoy the proceedings. It’s too bad you 
missed question period because that’s usually where most of the 
action is. But anyway, I would ask everyone to welcome them 
here today and I hope you enjoy your visit with us. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
 

Bill No. 38 
(continued) 

Clause 1 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I thank the member very much for 
the question, and it is indeed a good question. The answer is 
that you would be contravening the law in that case. 
 
Second question, not yet asked, but which I know is coming is, 
what am I supposed to do when the traffic’s sort of backed up 
so you can’t manage a proper turn without crossing the line? 
This a process, I guess, by which normally the members are 
assisted by the public service. I think the public service here 
today have a problem which has, I think, not been raised with 
them quite in this fashion before. 
 
So I think what we’re going to want to do, I say to the member 
from Moosomin, is take the problem you raise under 
consideration and it may result in some changes in the future. 
The officials admit that they do not have a ready solution to the 
problem which you raised. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
The reason I raise that is because — especially when you get 
high flow traffic, 5 o’clock traffic or early in the morning — the 
one particular example basically is one that could almost be 
treated in much the same manner. Because if it was left open as 
a turning lane, especially when you have . . . your turning arrow 
happens to precede the flow-through green arrow and access, if 
you wait till you were past the solid line, you would miss the 
green arrow because the . . . you’d be held . . . and basically 
you’re then hindering traffic. 
 
So it might be something that may be looked at in the future and 
maybe an intersection like that, where you might allow 
basically the turning, the turning . . . What do you call this? — 

the centre lane, in an area like that. 
 
So I thank you for the response. 
 
There’s another one regarding a provision regarding arrows 
where you have an arrow when facing a red light and you’re 
now allowed to proceed without stopping. Technically this is 
illegal under the current Act. 
 
If I understand the Act, Mr. Minister, if you’ve got a green 
arrow I believe, you come to an intersection, even with the red 
and the green arrow, you still must give way to any traffic 
proceeding if they’re proceeding through on the green. I’m not 
exactly sure what I would . . . I would treat that almost as an 
amber, that you proceed with caution. Is that not true? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Let me make the following 
comments. The existing section 65(5) allows a right turn on a 
red light or a red light with a green arrow, after stopping. The 
existing section 65(8) allows turns on green arrows with a red 
light, as allowed by the arrows after yielding the right of way 
. . . (inaudible) . . . from stopping. So section 65(5) requires a 
stop before making a right turn on a red light with a green 
arrow, and subsection 65(8) does not require the stop. The 
amended subsection 65 removes the reference to turning right 
on a red light with a green arrow; it still allows a right turn on a 
simple red light. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Okay, if I understand you correctly then, it’s 
basically allowing you just to proceed through. I think you said 
in section 65, it says you must stop and then proceed. And then 
I forget, 68 talked about just proceeding. Are you basically 
saying if you come up to an intersection with a red arrow . . . 
with a red light, a green turning arrow to the right, or even just 
with the red light — the knowledge that I believe on most red 
lights now — you can make the red . . . you can make the 
right-hand turn? 
 
Are you basically saying, Mr. Minister, that if you proceed, the 
intersection is free, you can make the turn immediately without 
stopping or are you . . . Because it would seem to me that it 
would still be appropriate to stop to make sure that the 
intersection was cleared before you proceeded to make that 
right, whether you’ve got the green arrow or not. 

 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Motorists are required to observe due 
caution and yield the right of way and check carefully, but in 
that instance there’s no need to actually stop, come to a dead 
stop. 

 
Mr. Toth: — Okay, thank you, Mr. Minister. Another 
requirement states that the permission of the Highway Traffic 
Board is needed in order to carry persons in public service 
vehicles, such as delivery trucks or semis. And it says that that’s 
removed that. Can you explain the reasons for that? 

 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — This amendment is made, I am 
informed, as a result of a recommendation from the 
Saskatchewan Trucking Association, Mr. Chairperson. As a 
result of a generally buoyant economy, expanding demand for 
trucking services, the industry has a problem which I guess we 
welcome if they don’t, and that is to having difficulty to finding 
drivers. And trying to make the occupation more family 



1128 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

friendly by allowing family members to travel in the truck with 
the trucker. And they have recommended to us that we delete 
this and leave the matter as a matter of company policy. And 
the companies, most of which are . . . all of which, I guess I 
should say, are reliable and hopefully would have licences. It’s 
a matter of company policy now. But it’s really intended to 
facilitate truckers taking their families along, which I guess is 
by far and away the most common usage of passengers in the 
truck. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Well thank you, Mr. Minister. It would seem to 
me that that would bound to be appropriate. I think we’ve had 
certainly some neighbours who were truckers, and of course in 
one case the wife also got a class A licence so she could drive 
and they could travel together. 
 
But I didn’t realize personally that you couldn’t transport . . . or 
couldn’t have someone in the vehicle. And you’re right; most 
companies with long hauls, with the new regulations, do send 
two drivers that do have . . . well you’re talking drivers. On the 
other hand, even just having somebody along, whether it's a 
family member, is certainly a way of keeping alert as well if 
you’ve got another person. 
 
So I think that’s appropriate, because I think that’s just some 
common sense on the road and it just takes some of what could 
be a long, dull drive, and maybe make sure that the driver stays 
alert with the number of trucks we certainly have moving on 
our highways. 
 
And I believe there is also one clause allowing the person to 
apply for the release of a vehicle impounded because it was 
driven by an unauthorized driver, and to appeal the hearing 
officer’s decision to the Highway Traffic Board. 
 
And I’m wondering, Mr. Minister, if you just could give a brief 
explanation as to that clause and what it really specifically 
means. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — If your vehicle is impounded in these 
circumstances, the legislation clearly provides an appeal over 
the telephone to officers. It was the intention of the 
administrators of this legislation that there would be a further 
appeal to Highway Traffic Board itself. These circumstances 
can be fairly punitive. 
 
The legislation however, I’m informed, was not clear about this 
right of appeal and so this amendment in effect, effects what 
the, what the administration intended. And that is that in the 
circumstances, there’s a further appeal to the Highway Traffic 
Board. So it’s just providing an appeal which they always 
intended to provide. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Chair, thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, 
wouldn’t it just be common sense if your vehicle is . . . if 
somebody’s borrowing your vehicle or using your vehicle and if 
for some reason as a result of an offence they’ve committed . . . 
that you wouldn’t have to go through a lot of red tape to have 
your vehicle delivered back to you or released from being 
impounded? 
 
It would seem to me that you’re putting a lot of onus upon . . . 
and I appreciate the fact that I think as owners of vehicles we 

need to be mindful of who we may allow the vehicle to be 
driven by. But at the same time, due to circumstance that we 
don’t have any control, I think that there should be some 
consideration and I would hope that Highway Traffic Board is 
mindful of this. 
 
And I think at times, sometimes individual officers may become 
fairly, fairly firm and just say this is the letter rather than 
recognizing the circumstances and the fact that in some cases it 
may be a family’s only method of . . . means of transportation 
— they’ve got the one vehicle. And unfortunately I had one of 
those circumstances come up and it makes it very difficult for a 
family who thought they were doing something good for an 
individual to ask the use of a vehicle. 
 
So I hope this simplifies the process as you’re talking about it 
and makes provisions to allow for, I guess a more meaningful 
and easier access unless there’s real strong reasons to impound 
or to maintain or to hold the vehicle. Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you. It certainly enhances the 
rights of the individuals to get their vehicle back and it provides 
a further level of appeal. 
 
Mr. Chairperson, I would . . . I think I should actually formally 
ask for leave to introduce a guest. 
 
Leave granted. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I have been informed that behind the 
bar is Gordon MacMurchy. Gordon MacMurchy is a former 
hockey player of note, if one goes back far enough. I believe the 
Maple Leafs was the team, and I’m going from memory from a 
long time. Was a minister in the Blakeney government, a 
distinguished minister of Agriculture; was I think, the minister 
of Education when the current collective bargaining process 
was brought in; was minister of Municipal Affairs. 
 
I know all members will want to join me in welcoming a . . . 
And he’s been mayor of Semans for some time. I know all 
members will want to join with me in recognizing a 
distinguished Saskatchewan citizen. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
 

Bill No. 38 
(continued) 

 
Clause 1 agreed to. 
 
Clauses 2 to 7 inclusive agreed to. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’d like to just extend 
a thanks to the minister and his officials for their response to the 
questions this afternoon. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you. I’d like to first of all 
thank the opposition for what I thought were some very good 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1129 

questions, one of which we will be reviewing I think, and 
perhaps bringing back an amendment. 
 
I also want to thank the officials for their assistance. And that 
having been said, I move the Bill be reported without 
amendment. 
 
The committee agreed to report the Bill. 
 

Bill No. 39 — The Vehicle Administration 
Amendment Act, 1998 

 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much. The officials 
. . . Pardon me, Mr. Chairperson. The officials are the same and 
we stand ready to answer any questions that the opposition 
members may have. 
 
Clause 1 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chair. Mr. 
Minister, and welcome to your officials. We have a few 
questions on Bill No. 39 for clarification I think, more so than 
for actual direction of policy. 
 
Well this Bill suggests, I think in section no., new section no. 
14, clause 3, suggests that it will allow the Government of 
Saskatchewan to enter into agreements with other countries. 
Mr. Minister, do you expect a number of agreements, and when 
do you expect these kinds of agreements to occur with different 
countries? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much. We now have 
agreements in place with many of the jurisdictions in the U.S. 
(United States), that being the States. I am informed by the 
officials that we anticipate agreements with members of the 
European Economic Community in the relatively near future. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, have 
other provinces entered into agreements with the jurisdictions in 
the States as well as the European countries that you’ve 
suggested? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — The answer to that is yes. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Minister, in section (2) of clause 3 it 
suggests that the minister or the administrator shall obtain the 
approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council for 
expenditures greater that $50,000. Can you indicate what you 
expect would be the kinds of agreements that would be entered 
into? And because there is no maximum amount here, are there 
limits placed on what kinds of agreements the minister can 
enter into? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — This is a standard provision which 
we put in all legislation, and has been put in all legislation for 
quite some time actually. The amount used to be lower. I think 
when we took office I remember the amount being $10,000, and 
that’s since been increased. But this is a . . . there’s a standard 
provision which is put in all legislation. 
 
I’m told they don’t have anything unusual in mind for this. This 
is just the provisions of The Financial Administration Act at 
work so that the Department of Finance is able to exercise its 

usual control over the finances of the province. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — From your knowledge, Mr. Minister, would 
you be able to give any examples, historically speaking, of the 
kinds of situations where we’ve entered into a financial liability 
of greater than $50,000? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Not in this administration. No, not in 
this administration — any number of examples in other 
departments, but I’m told that not in this subvote. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, in 
clause no. 4 it indicates that besides the vision report that has 
been required by licensing agents like SGI previously, you’ve 
now added the terms, addictions counsellor or psychologist. 
 
Two questions there, Mr. Minister. The concern that has been 
expressed before when it was just the requirement for a vision 
report was who was going to pay for that, and I think we have 
had that discussion previously in this House. Has that problem 
been corrected regarding the vision tests? And now that you’ve 
added or this Bill proposes to add that an addictions counsellor 
as well as a psychologist report may have to be obtained, I’m 
sure that there may be costs involved. Who will be picking up 
those costs? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — The intention is that SGI will pay for 
them. Just a cautionary note from the officials here — they tell 
me that in order to effect that under this regulation, there will 
need to be amendments to regulations and those will follow in 
due course, I assume probably before the Act is proclaimed. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Minister, were the regulations changed to 
allow for SGI to pick up the costs for vision reports as they now 
are? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Yes. Those regulations will have to 
be put in place in order for SGI to be authorized to make the 
payments. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Minister, then when do you see the 
regulations being adjusted and when can people who have been 
asked for vision reports and have incurred expenses, when will 
that pass through to . . . the cost be passed on to SGI? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — The officials are reluctant to give us 
a date. There are apparently some financial implications. I’m 
not sure of the exact amount. The officials do not have a firm 
date by which . . . They do not have a firm target date for 
putting this into effect. So not a very satisfactory answer but 
that’s the answer, such as it is. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I know that we had 
expressed that concern a year ago and there was I think, a 
concern as well as a commitment on behalf of . . . by the 
minister to look at those changes at least a year ago. And I 
would encourage the minister to see whether things can proceed 
in this calendar year. 
 
Final couple of points, Mr. Minister. This Act now brings into 
place, I guess what could be referred to as reciprocal 
agreements between Saskatchewan as a province, and states of 
United States, whereby driving infractions where there are 



1130 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

convictions or cancellations I guess, or suspensions that would 
occur in the United States, would now apply to Saskatchewan. 
 
I guess two questions. One, what were we relying on before 
when we had someone from the United States I guess come to 
Saskatchewan with a previous American driver’s licence, and 
that being suspended, how did we deal with that before? 
 
And then the second question, now that this will be in place, 
will the reciprocity work the opposite way in that someone who 
currently is in Saskatchewan with a Saskatchewan driver’s 
licence, incurs a suspension or cancellation and then moves to 
the United States, will that also follow them in that type of a 
reciprocity agreement? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — The answer to your question is yes. 
The intention is that there will be mutual recognition — ours of 
their convictions and they of ours. It goes without saying of 
course that we will . . . in order for ours to be recognized there, 
there would have to be legislative changes there with all the 
complications it ensues. But the intention of the agreement 
which has been entered into between the jurisdictions, is that 
there shall be mutual recognition — ours of theirs and theirs of 
ours. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — The first half of my question, Mr. Minister. 
How did we deal with this before? Did we not have some sort 
of reciprocity or did we not know about suspensions and 
cancellations of people coming from other provinces, other 
states, and applying for a Saskatchewan driver’s licence? How 
did we deal with this up to this point? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I know I’m informed that heretofore 
there has been no system for recognizing convictions for in the 
U.S. I think it would be contrary to what most people would 
have expected and believed. But that I’m sure it is the case. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — In that case, Mr. Minister, I’m glad to see that 
that section is changing. Because I think that’s very clear, as a 
former owner of an insurance brokerage, it’s very difficult to 
determine whether or not someone has convictions and 
suspensions when they're coming from another country or from 
another province. 
 
And I’m glad to see we’re making those changes. And I want to 
thank you and your officials for your comments today. 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I’ve been just 
waiting in great anticipation to ask this minister a few 
questions. I wasn’t aware that it would be on The Vehicle 
Administration Act, Mr. Chair, but I’m very pleased it is. 
 
Just a couple of questions of clarification. I’m hoping that this 
falls within a similar purview. 
 
My first question is, do you have a process, or a check and 
balance in place for mandatory testing? And I apologize if this 
is not the appropriate forum to ask this particular question. But 
in dealing with driver’s licences and suspensions and offences, 
is there a program in place where mandatory testing suddenly 
appears on a screen or when a licence comes up for a renewal, 
because of certain criteria. I guess I’m curious about whether or 
not there are criteria in place to enact or initiate mandatory 

testing. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I am informed, Mr. Chairperson, that 
there is no mandatory testing except where you enter into a new 
class of licence. Otherwise there’s no mandatory testing except 
school bus drivers who are tested every three years. Apart from 
that exception, there is no mandatory testing; except of course 
when you enter into a new class of licence, there of course there 
is mandatory testing. 
 
There remains discretionary testing in the discretion of the 
officials of Highway Traffic Board, generally on medical 
grounds, where medical reasons are brought to the attention of 
the Highway Traffic Board. 
 
(1530) 
 
Mr. Osika: — Those medical attentions would have to be 
brought to the attention of the Traffic Board by whom? — an 
individual? a family member? I guess the reason that I’m asking 
the question — I’m getting on in years and I’m just wondering 
if one day I’ll get a letter saying, hey listen, at this point in time 
we’re going to bring you in and check you out because you 
haven’t been checked out for 30 years or 20 years. Perhaps it 
might be time that, as the Justice minister suggests, I may need 
a little testing along the way here. 
 
So I just wondered if there was an expansion of that criteria for 
mandatory testing at some point for perhaps the assurance of 
safety for individuals themselves? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — No, there is no testing at a certain 
age, which I think is what the member is alluding to. That 
would be contrary to the, I would venture to say, that would be 
contrary to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
 
But there is discretionary testing when medical information 
comes to the attention of the Highway Traffic Board. It may 
come from anywhere. It may come from, the member 
mentioned, family members. It may come from occasionally . . . 
medical doctors will be concerned about a patient and exercise 
that concern by passing on information. It sometimes comes 
from observations made by members of the RCMP or police 
force. 
 
It may come from anywhere. But there is no testing on the basis 
of age. 
 
Mr. Osika: — And no random testing? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — And no random testing, no. 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank 
you, Mr. Minister, and I didn’t put your officials through a great 
deal of anxiety so I . . . But thank you. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — No, the member didn’t. I thank the 
member opposite, members opposite, for their questions, and 
again I want to thank the officials for the assistance they’ve 
provided on this Bill. 
 
Clause 1 agreed to. 
 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1131 

Clauses 2 to 9 inclusive agreed to. 
 
The committee agreed to report the Bill. 
 

Bill No. 15 — The Gas Inspection 
Amendment Act, 1998 

 
The Acting Chair (Mr. Johnson): — I would ask the minister 
to introduce his officials. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I am sure the members will want to 
join with me in welcoming Gordon Williams, who is the 
province’s chief gas inspector. 
 
Clause 1 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chair. Mr. 
Minister, welcome to your official. 
 
A few points of clarification, I guess, first of all. The intention 
behind a Bill like this, I mean I think I hear you in your 
explanations refer to gas installation, gas maintenance, and the 
like. What’s the overall purpose of this amendment? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Let me answer the member very 
generally by saying the purpose of the amendment is to enhance 
safety with respect to the use of natural gas. It encourages 
routine maintenance of gas equipment by removing the word 
“maintenance” from the definition of gas installation; clarifies 
that an operator of a distribution system is responsible for 
ensuring that gas piping, as distinct from gas equipment, is free 
from defects; clarifies that a gas inspector has authority to deal 
with all hazards of all types relating to gas equipment or any 
gas installation, as well as potential dangers not only to persons, 
but to property. So generally it’s intended to enhance safety. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you for that explanation, Mr. Minister; 
and that’s something that we encourage as well. 
 
Currently in the province of Saskatchewan, what is the total 
number of gas inspectors that we would have available for call 
on a gas inspection request. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — There are 21 inspectors in the 
province. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — What is the current waiting-list, in terms of 
time, from the time that someone would submit for a gas 
inspection to the time that an inspector will actually do that, and 
does that vary from large urban centres like our 12 cities to 
rural areas and northern areas? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I am assured by Mr. Williams that if 
a safety concern is phoned in or brought to their attention, that’s 
dealt with very promptly right away. The routine inspections of 
installations, they attempt to do it within six months; currently 
running a little behind that but that’s the time frames within 
which they work. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — With the clarification for installation and 
maintenance, obviously you want maintenance to occur on an 
annual basis, and that probably will. Do you expect that the 
number of requests for gas inspection will decrease because of 

the fact that maintenance is now taken out of that? Did it cause 
a problem before and will you expect there to be a shortening, I 
guess, of that six-month waiting period if indeed there are fewer 
requests that a gas inspector has to actually attend to? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — No, I’m told that the provision with 
respect to maintenance didn’t really have any impact on the 
frequency of the time it took to make the inspections. It is 
hoped there’ll be fewer disputes between the contractors and the 
homeowners, but it won’t have any effect, beneficial or 
deleterious, on the length of time it takes to have an inspection 
done. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Minister, could you clarify then, an 
inspection, is it only needed when there is actually, I guess, a 
breaking of a pipe, because of a new installation, of changes to 
piping, and therefore then regular maintenance changes to 
equipment or to other things that will occur do not require that 
type of inspection now? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — No, I’m assured by the officials that 
they don’t normally go out looking for maintenance issues. 
They inspect installations which are brought to their attention 
through the purchase of permits or they inspect matters where 
there’s a complaint or concern phoned in to them. But they 
don’t normally go around looking for maintenance . . . places to 
inspect. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — What are the costs to a consumer to have a 
gas inspection done? Does it vary with the type of inspection? 
Does it vary with the areas of the province? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — The vast majority of inspections are 
done at the . . . when contractors are installing equipment, and it 
varies depending on what’s being done. For a new home, the 
inspection would be $110. It might be as little as $40 if it were 
for a water heater. But it varies on the type of installation. 
 
Where there’s a safety concern — that means somebody phones 
in or complains — there’s no fee charged. They go and make 
the inspection and whatever the result, there’s no fee charged. 
 
It is possible for someone to phone in and say, I’d like an 
inspection done, I’m concerned about it, or whatever. In that 
case they . . . there is a fee charged for someone who asks for an 
inspection. It can . . . it starts at $35, might go up to $70, 
depending again on the nature of the inspection. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, 
you’ve indicated that the actual equipment will now become the 
responsibility of the installer I think, not the people who are 
laying the pipe or placing the pipe. Have you had consultations 
with the mechanical companies and the plumbing companies of 
the province to see whether or not they will be affected and 
whether or not they support the changes that you have 
proposed? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — The contractors have asked for this 
for some time actually. I know from having served in the 
government over the years that contractors have asked for this 
for a number of years. It is not so much that they want the 
additional work and business, although there may be something 
to that, they simply see this as part of their responsibility; they 



1132 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

do the installations and they should be doing the maintenance. 
So this is being done at their request, a request made over a 
number of years. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — And the other side of the coin of course, is 
the actual installers of the lines. Do we have a large number of 
companies that are involved in actual gas line installation in the 
province and have there been consultation meetings with that 
group? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Yes, the same thing applies. By far 
and away the largest single installer there is SaskEnergy, but 
they’re involved in the transition and they’ll be working closely 
with Mr. Williams and his other public servants. 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. 
Minister. Welcome to your official. I have just one question 
with respect to a portion of this Act dealing with accessibility. 
Will the amendment here allow greater accessibility? I guess 
what I’m asking, in the event of a complaint or a concern, 
access to a facility to get at those, at the metres of whatever may 
need to be checked out, does that give people greater powers? 
 
(1545) 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — No, it does not change the powers 
with respect to the ability to access property, which is the 
member’s question I think, nor has it been a problem in the 
past. I think if it were, if getting access to property were a 
problem, I think the officials would probably recommend to the 
government that we amend the law; but I’m told this does not 
change the powers and they have not had any particular 
problem with this in the past. 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you, and I believe you’ve answered that. 
I was referring to the explanation. The objective of 23(1), to 
remove unnecessarily restrictive circumstances with respect to 
which a gas inspector has the authority to exercise various 
powers provided for in this subsection. But that that does not 
extend from, let’s see, from what is already in existence. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — No it doesn’t. It extends the 
circumstances I guess, under which an inspection may be done, 
but doesn’t change his powers and rights with respect to access 
to property. 
 
Mr. Osika: — Okay, thank you. Just another bit of a 
clarification, I guess. And I expect that there will be or there are 
occasions where someone from SaskEnergy and SaskPower 
would need to be involved in some of the inspections that are 
being carried out for various facilities. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Typically, SaskEnergy will respond 
to a complaint about the odour. And typically people will call 
SaskEnergy, because they don’t get a bill for it, and I guess they 
might get a bill if they called a contractor. 
 
SaskEnergy will always respond to that, will rectify the 
problem if it’s their lines, if it’s a question of their equipment. If 
it’s a question of a contractor’s equipment, then they may well 
call the officials, Mr. Williams and other public servants, and 
have the inspection done and thereby have the contractor repair 
it. 

Mr. Osika: — Okay, thank you. One final question and it deals 
with gasification. Is there a major gasification program in place 
for the coming year throughout rural Saskatchewan? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I wouldn’t anticipate this official 
would have that information. That would be more properly 
asked of the SaskEnergy minister and officials when they 
appear before the Crown Corporations officials . . . Crown 
Corporations Committee. 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I just kind of took a 
shot in the dark and I thought that being all-knowing, you might 
just have that at your fingertips. I thank you very much. Thank 
you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chair. 
Just one follow-up question, Mr. Minister. You’ve indicated 
that you have 21 inspectors in the province and that you have 
nearly a six-month waiting period time. And I guess it begs the 
question, on average then, how many inspections are requested 
weekly, monthly, 
annually����������������������������
���� 21 officials, so that we have such a, I think, an 
extensive waiting period? What kinds of numbers are we 
dealing with there? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — We are . . . I’m told that there are up 
to 30,000 permits, and therefore inspections, a year done by the 
system. An individual inspector may do up to 1,500 a year. 
 
I would point out to the member opposite that we are talking 
about a six-month wait for the installations, so this is 
presumably new or tested equipment. And the officials feel that 
that’s a satisfactory period given the fact you’re dealing with 
new equipment. 
 
And I would remind the member that where there are 
complaints, those are dealt with forthwith. So it’s only new 
systems that wait six months. And there haven’t I think, been 
any terribly serious problems occur with respect to that waiting 
period. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Minister, from the construction 
contracting industry then, in terms of I guess in the actual 
construction of a new home or renovation, the six-month 
waiting period does not pose any problem to them and you 
haven’t had a concern expressed by that particular part of the 
industry? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — No, not the contracting industry. I 
gather because it doesn’t delay the construction of the house. It 
can be done after the . . . It doesn’t delay the installation or 
construction. It can be done after it’s completed. 
 
Clause 1 agreed to. 
 
Clauses 2 to 6 inclusive agreed to. 
 
The committee agreed to report the Bill. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Yes. Mr. Chairperson, I would like to 
thank Mr. Williams for attending. And inevitably there is what 
appears, I’m sure, to the officials to be an overly long wait 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1133 

waiting for this to start; so I would want to thank Mr. Williams 
for assisting us here and for waiting patiently. That having been 
said, Mr. Chairperson, I move the committee rise to report 
progress and ask for leave to sit again.

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 
 

General Revenue Fund 
Legislation — Vote 21 

Conflict of Interest Commissioner 
 
The Acting Chair (Mr. Whitmore): — I would like the 
minister to introduce his officials here today. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Yes, I’m pleased to have with me today, 
Darcy McGovern from the Department of Justice. 
 
Subvote (LG09) 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you. And welcome, Mr. Minister, and 
welcome to your officials. 
 
This afternoon we’re talking about the Conflict of Interest 
Commissioner, and I’m sure it’s one of the departments or one 
of the areas of government that most people don’t think about 
very often. And I’m just wondering if you can give me an idea 
of . . . summarize the activities of the department that’s . . . that 
has taken place over the last year. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I would remind the member that this 
office is an office related to the legislature and reports to the 
legislature, and practically, the report that’s filed by the Conflict 
of Interest Commissioner sets out what he’s done. 
 
And I think practically, he says the activities of the office 

during the last year included: receiving private disclosure 
statements from the members and preparing and filing these 
appropriate public disclosure statements; providing opinions 
from time to time to members in accordance with section 27(1) 
of the Act, and they’re given both formally in writing and 
informally; and then also providing opinions pursuant to section 
29(1) of the Act, although this last year there was no request 
that was public . . . (inaudible) . . . But this is all in the report 
that’s been filed with the legislature. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I’m sure you would 
have mentioned it, but I’m just wondering if there’s been any 
major legislative or regulatory changes to this commission over 
the past year. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — There were no major changes to any of 
the regulations or the Act, but there were some administrative 
changes around the format of the disclosure statement used by 
members. 
 
Ms. Draude: — And have you encountered any difficulty in 
securing conflict of interest reports of members of this 
Assembly? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — That’s not a question that I can answer 
because it would be more properly asked of the Conflict of 
Interest Commissioner himself, as he then in turn reports to the 
Speaker. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Are you aware of any changes to legislation 
that would improve public confidence in the members of this 
Assembly? 
 
(1600) 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I’m not sure exactly what the question 
intended, but there are no changes that have been suggested that 
I know of at this point that would accomplish what the 
member’s talking about. 
 
I think that in this particular area there are some discussions — 
I guess you could put it that way — around the extent of 
conflict. And we’ve looked at some of those things over the 
years, but this particular year there haven’t been any specific 
suggestions. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Can you tell me how many staff there is in 
your office? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — There’s only one person and that’s the 
Conflict of Interest Commissioner. But he then rents space from 
the law firm where he’s located which includes secretarial help. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Do you contract out any work? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — No. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Has there been any need to seek any legal or 
auditing opinions from the outside over the last year? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — The Conflict of Interest Commissioner 
does have the power to do that, but we’re not aware that he did 
that at all in the last year and it doesn’t show up in his report. 



1134 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

 
Ms. Draude: — The operating budget has stayed stable for the 
past several years at around $31,000. However, your salaries 
have shown a relatively large variation. Two years ago, you 
were paying $75,000 in salaries and this year about $50,000, 
and next year there’s a budget for about $60,000. 
 
Can you give us an idea of why there’s this change in salaries? 
Why there’s a shift in the salaries? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — If you’ll recall from last year when we 
talked about the estimates, we were advised by the 
commissioner that the $75,000 budgeted for the previous year 
was more than he needed. And so we dropped it down to 
50,000. But this year the Board of Internal Economy, through a 
directive no. 20 adopted on January 6, 1994, set the salary of 
the commissioner at an amount equal to one-half of the salary 
of the Ombudsman, appointed pursuant to The Ombudsman’s 
Act. 
 
And the Ombudsman’s salary is tied directly to the salary of a 
Provincial Court judge. So therefore when we resolved the 
Provincial Court judges’ lawsuits, then the amount went up by 
the 10,000 that you see here. 
 
So it’s directly related to the directive of the Board of Internal 
Economy. 
 
Ms. Draude: — If they need more or less money, I would 
imagine it can be done without going back to the Board of 
Internal Economy. Or is it something that they would have to 
have a specific request so that they could do more work if that 
was required? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Is your question related to salary or to the 
budget? 
 
Ms. Draude: — . . . higher than the $60,000. Are they going to 
have to go back again to ask for it, or is that just something that 
will automatically happen? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I think the nature of this particular job, if 
there was a major issue that arose that involved quite a bit of 
accounting or lawyers or other fees and work by the 
commissioner, then that would be dealt with through the normal 
budgeting process to deal with the special circumstance. 
 
So I don’t think there would ever be a situation where the 
commissioner would run out of money to do a job that needed 
to be done. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Minister, in a Crown corporations review 
it’s been discussed that some of the members of the committee 
might be in conflict with the Channel Lake inquiry board 
because they sat on the CIC (Crown Investments Corporation) 
board. Would your office have the authority or the expertise to 
make rulings on questions of this nature? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I think the question was asked of me, but 
you’re basically asking the question whether the commissioner 
could do that. And if you look at the Act, there is the possibility 
of raising this issue under the terms of the Act because the 
commissioner is an officer of the legislature and basically he’s 

bound by the rules that are set out in the Act. So presumably, it 
would be possible to raise it. 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I appreciate your 
attendance, I appreciate your official being here, and I don’t 
have any further questions. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you.

Legislation — Vote 21 

Freedom of Information and Privacy Commissioner 
 
Subvote (LG08) 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you again. And thank you again, Mr. 
Minister. Mr. Minister, can you give us an idea of how many 
freedom of information requests the office receives in a year? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Once again I would advise the member 
that the Information and Privacy Commissioner is an officer of 
the legislature and he reports to the legislature through the 
Speaker. But based on the annual report that has been filed, the 
commissioner points out that he received 30 requests for review 
and he issued 13 reports following the review. 
 
Ms. Draude: — So there was only 43 FOIs (freedom of 
information) received last year from the department? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — If the question you asked is how many 
received across government, that is set out in his report and the 
number would be 458. The number that I gave you was the 
number of those requests that were then appealed to the 
Commissioner and he then reviewed 30. So there were 30 
appeals sent to him. After those appeals he ended up doing 13 
reports. But the total number was 458. 
 
Ms. Draude: — That makes sense. I was beginning to think 
that maybe we were the only ones that would send in FOIs 
because I’m sure our offices sent in more than that. I’m 
wondering if you can give us an idea who the most frequent 
clients of the office are. Is it the opposition, or is it the 
taxpayers’ associations, or media, or just the general public? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — The statistics in the report are set out 
based on the departments that receive them rather than based on 
who actually files the request. And basically the reason for that 
is that if we reported who was filing the requests that would be 
a breach of their privacy. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. And then can you 
give us an idea of what the hot spots are, which areas of 
government gets the most requests for FOIs under legislation? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Based on the report with the legislature, 
the top area is Health at 50, second is Liquor and Gaming with 
41, and then third is the Human Rights Commission with 40. 
Then it goes down from there to zero. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Minister, does this office have a 
promotional budget? By that, I’m just wondering if there’s any 
effort made to ensure that the public knows that the office exists 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1135 

and that they have this service available to them to protect those 
dollars? 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — The commissioner does have some money 
available for an education role and he fulfils that role in a 
couple of different ways. The first most obvious one is by 
answering calls when people do call his office. He also has a 
pamphlet that is distributed, and I think he’s also available if 
people want to ask him to come and talk about his job and what 
he does. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. But in order for any 
of those scenarios to work the people are going to have to know 
about him in the first place before they can phone in or before 
he can go speak to them. I’m wondering if there is any way that 
the general public is let know. Are schools let know? Is there 
ever something put in the paper advising people that there is 
somebody out there that can answer questions for them? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Well I think that the simple answer to 
your question is that the number is available various places — 
information lines, things like that. 
 
Also we know from the public discussion around concern 
relating to privacy and freedom of information that there is 
general knowledge throughout the province that if anybody has 
a particular problem in this area that a person can contact that 
official. And it’s also, I suppose, part of our national system 
that every province has an official that deals with these kinds of 
issues. 
 
But there isn’t specifically a campaign that goes out and 
explains the job and the role to the public, but I think it’s part of 
a whole array of government services that are available. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I do think that it 
probably wouldn’t be expensive and it wouldn’t hurt for the 
young people in our province to be made aware through the 
school system that this department is there. And if they have 
questions that they should write in or phone in or whatever it 
would take to answer some things that inquisitive minds may be 
coming up with. 
 
Under FOI legislation, departments are required to respond to 
requests within 30 days. What role do you play in enforcing this 
time limit? 
 
(1615) 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Okay. I’ll go from the report here. But as I 
said before there are 458 requests which is comprised of 121 
personal requests and 337 general requests — they’re broken 
down that way. 
 
The processing time for applications throughout government is 
such that of the total of 458, 313 were processed within 30 
days. And then another 35 were . . . 413, I should say, 413 were 
within 30 days. Another 35 were within 60 days. And there 
were only 10 that took more than 60 days. 
 
Ms. Draude: — That seems like an incredible rate, then. I 
congratulate you. It seems like this is something that all 
departments should be working this well. Maybe we could even 
tell the federal government about that. It takes considerably 

longer for them. 
 
Can you tell me how many FOI requests were rejected last year 
and how many of those were appealed? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Those were the numbers that I gave you 
earlier. There were 30 appeals. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Of the ones that were appealed, were any of 
them overturned by your office? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — The request is about the commissioner’s 
office as opposed to my office. But practically in the report, he 
upheld the refusal to disclose the records in one instance out of 
the 30 requests. There were two cases where he decided that he 
had no jurisdiction. And in the remainder of the requests he said 
that access should be provided. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Again that sounds like good information for 
the general public. 
 
I’m wondering, Mr. Minister, what role you see yourself 
playing for and in expanding the mandate of this commission. 
For example, the Provincial Auditor has campaigned for years 
in the media for the Crowns to be included in his jurisdiction. 
And is there any effort being made to expand that information 
that is available to the public? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Well I’m not sure of the intent of your 
question, but practically in Saskatchewan all of the Crown 
corporations are included in this Act already. And so that the 
report I gave you, including the 450 . . . what was that, 458 
applications, that did include applications to SaskPower, 
SaskEnergy, Sask Government Insurance, Sask Crop Insurance 
— I mean all of those corporations are included in this report. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Good news to the minister. Some of the Crown 
corporation committees, like SaskPower Commercial, doesn’t 
fall under the jurisdiction of your office. Can you explain why it 
doesn’t? And is this exemption really appropriate, and can we 
correct it? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Well we know that SaskPower 
Corporation is included, and presumably the corporation that 
you’re asking about is a subsidiary of SaskPower . . . (inaudible 
interjection) . . . Yes. And if it’s not included, well then we 
would be willing to look at that and see that it would be 
reviewed to see whether it should be included in the rest. But 
practically the legislation is quite broad and includes the 
corporations, Crown corporations of the government. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Minister, you’re just a bearer of great 
tidings today. You’re telling us that some, whether we can get 
SaskPower Commercial included under FOI or conflict of 
interest by . . . Do we appeal or do we write a letter, or how 
would we make sure that we could get the information from the 
commercial division? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I think practically you’d have to recognize 
as well that this is going to be considered. And one of the 
considerations, obviously if it’s a commercial operation, there 
would be some restrictions on what information we could get 
from them, but practically we’ll, you know, we’ll take a look at 



1136 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

that based on these discussions. 
 
In a similar way, your previous comments about education 
through this office; oh I know that the commissioner will be 
reading these debates and I’m sure he’ll take that information 
and use it as a way of looking at whether . . . other ways he can 
enhance the office. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Minister, you’ll recall that last year there 
was public discussion about the release of cabinet documents 
and now I’d just like some clarification. Previously cabinet 
documents were kept secret for 25 years but last year’s 
legislation protected them for . . . is it a further 25 years? So 
they would actually be protected for 50 years. Or could you 
explain that please? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I think the question that you’re asking is 
about the changes that were made to the provincial archives Act 
as opposed to this particular legislation. 
 
Ms. Draude: — That would be the one. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — And so that those questions don’t relate to 
this particular commissioner. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Minister, it’s our understanding that other 
jurisdictions in Canada release cabinet documents after 10 
years. I’m just wondering why our legislation is out of step and 
if there’s any reason why our cabinet documents are more 
secretive than in other provinces? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I think today we’re dealing with the 
Privacy Commissioner and the Freedom of Information 
Commissioner, and the questions you’re asking relate to The 
Archives Act and the arrangements that are made between the 
provincial archives and individuals surrounding paper, papers 
that may have been deposited there. And so that’s not an area 
for this particular discussion. 
 
Ms. Draude: — So anything to do with these cabinet 
documents is something that we’d have to be bringing up to 
who then? 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Well, the provincial archives Act are 
under the Minister of Municipal Government. But some of the, 
you know, opinions that you’ve registered here, well I certainly 
report them to my colleagues, that you have some concerns in 
this area. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Minister, because the 
remaining questions that I do have are involving The Archives 
Act and I guess then we will bring them up when the 
appropriate minister comes. So again I thank you and I thank 
your official.

Subvote (PE01) 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. And, 
Madam Minister, welcome to you and your officials. I know 
that they have been waiting patiently, that we’re late in the day 
today. And I’m not sure exactly how much information we’ll be 
able to get through today. But I know your department of 
course is responsible for a lot of areas from student loans, and 
assisting to university funding, to regional colleges, to job 
training and skills, and those are a lot of different areas that 
we’ll have I think a number of questions for you. 
 
I would ask if you have had the opportunity to compile a 
response to a global request regarding employees and direction 
that your department has undertaken the kinds of things that 
have been put forward to all departments as I understand from 
the opposition. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Yes. We’ve just received that in our 
office today and we’ll get right on it, but we’ve just received it. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Minister. I’ll look 
forward to that response. I want to begin with one question in 
the area of student loans and leave that area for a future date. 
And of course the first question is one that has been brought to 
our attention by many, many individuals. Many people have 
called. 
 
As a result of the announcement of the federal government 
regarding interest on student loans, existing students loans, and 
of course the announcement in the budget of your government 
that indicated that the provincial student loan interest, that there 
would be a deduction, the question that we’re receiving most 
often now by way of telephone call or letter is will banks, will 
financial institutions, be contacting individuals who currently 
have a student loan and explain to them the procedures that they 
will have to follow over the course of 1999 and onwards 
regarding claiming the interest as both the federal deduction and 
a provincial deduction? How can they do that? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Yes. It’s the bank that explains it to the 
students. I think the logic here is because they’re so familiar 
with helping people with financial information, understanding 
different kinds of accounts, loan obligations, etc., they’re really 
in a better position to give much broader advice to students on 
financial matters. 
 
(1630) 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Will the first year that will be affected, will 
that be 1998? And will financial institutions be required to 
submit T5’s or T6’s or whatever is necessary to indicate to the 



May 13, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 1137 

individual the amount of interest paid over the year, and what 
their credit will be both federally and provincially? 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — They’re going to be doing in the form 
of a letter to the students indicating what interest they paid in 
the current year. And it’s this year that we’re in now, so it 
would be reflected in the next tax year. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Good. Thank you very much, Madam 
Minister. I know that that’s an answer I think that a lot of 
people have been looking for in terms of what kind of 
procedures they have to follow. Whether it’ll be their obligation 
to ensure that they receive the credit, or indeed whether or not 
the banking institution will be actually approaching those 
people who have loans. And you’ve clarified that. 
 
As I said, I’d like to return to the area of student loans on 
another day and begin today, I guess, by addressing the area of 
JobStart-Future Skills employment programs — tremendous 
change to your department I think, Madam Minister. If I look at 
your FTE (full-time equivalent) in terms of the staff 
complement that you’re expecting within your department, I see 
a significant increase. 
 
Could you explain how the changes federally that have come 
about, and the changes that you now see your department 
having to go through regarding the future start and job skills 
training program? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — There’s been substantial increases in 
what the program does but the increase in person-years hasn’t 
been related to that. It’s been related to the transfer of 
responsibilities and staff from the federal government through 
the Labour Market Agreement and also the employees of the 
New Careers Crown Corporation into there. So that would be 
where those staff have come from. They aren’t new staff, 
they’re just relocated. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Could you explain how the federal changes 
have affected your direction, your objectives within your 
department, and the kinds of things that you are now 
responsible for that were outside of your area before? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Well I think there’s two ways federal 
changes have affected us. You may remember, I think it was a 
couple of years ago now, that they changed the Employment 
Insurance Act. And one of the things they did when they 
changed that Act is they moved from funding spaces in 
institutions to funding individuals. So institutions no longer 
have a guarantee of funds to operate the institutions, and they 
have to depend on whether or not people subscribe to their 
institution in order to know whether they’ve got funding for the 
year. 
 
And this has resulted in some pretty dramatic losses in funds. I 
think SIAST lost something like 9 million in funds through seat 
purchase that used to be there before. And the seat purchase 
also that the federal government used to do used to ensure that 
categories of persons coming out of the EI (Employment 
Insurance) system would have guaranteed seats set aside for 
them, and that doesn’t exist any more as well, as a matter of the 
EI legislation. 
 
Now the other change that’s taking place is with the labour 

market human resource services. And instead of having sort of 
three different offices — one for people on assistance, one for 
the general population, and one for people on EI — that will 
now be collapsed all into one single window service, with 
hopefully much better use of staff time and some ability to use 
some of that surplus time for more individual counselling and 
career support and advice. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Minister. The program 
that you’ve just described, and how the current institutions in 
Saskatchewan will deal with the changes that have been 
imposed upon Saskatchewan federally, do you see any changes 
to the programs as far as whether or not we can accommodate 
the needs of our students? Or has the financial pressure that has 
been placed upon SIAST — you’ve indicated a potential of $9 
million reduction in terms of funding from the federal 
government to those seat purchases — has that affected the 
overall delivery of an education program in Saskatchewan? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — I think the simplest way to answer that 
is that we’ve back-filled the money that was removed in that 
way, but we’ve also added some new programing in 
JobStart-Future Skills, and so the institutions, by accessing 
some of these new programs, can make up for some of the 
money that they lost. I think as well they’re probably moving a 
little bit, not hugely, but a little bit into doing also some 
contract training and some other things from, employers that 
have training needs, from the institutions. So they’re maybe 
having to be a little more entrepreneurial in that sense. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Minister. A recent 
announcement, if I recall, through JobStart and Future Skills, 
indicated that programs like trucking, implement 
manufacturing, sound and recording, apparel and textile, and 
tourism had each received $50,000 — I think was the amount 
that had been announced — in provincial grants.  
 
That’s a sum of some $250,000 in total to those five particular 
industries. Were those the only industries that you looked at in 
terms of providing an assistance? And I guess the question then, 
if that was the only five, what about the other industries that are 
involved in, you know, great work in Saskatchewan. Will they 
be provided with any grants to allow them to expand and to 
research their areas? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — It’s an industry-driven program and 
when they’re ready, they approach us and discuss it with us. 
There’s nine partnerships have been signed to date: apparel and 
textile; tourism; implement manufacturing; recording; film and 
video; and culture; fire safety; export manufacturing; and truck 
and transport are the nine signed to date. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — What will the grant monies that you’ve 
provided . . . what do you hope that the various nine industries, 
what do you hope that they will do with that additional money 
that you provided to them? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — It’s largely to do their human resource 
planning; so that they can work with the training institutions 
and with individuals to make sure that they have that steady 
supply of skilled and trained workers that they need to keep 
their industry moving and not find out that all of a sudden 
they’ve hit a wall where they don’t have the people they need. 



1138 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

And it can be very devastating, particularly to an export 
industry, if they don’t have the people they need at the time 
when they’ve got the orders to fill. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Madam Minister, what is the total dollar 
figure that your department will deal with for the 
JobStart-Future Skills program? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — The JobStart-Future Skills is 13.2 
million overall; and to date since its inception, there’s 7,600 
people who have been trained under that. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Minister. Under the same 
section, the employment and programs and services section, 
you’ve indicated . . . or the Estimates indicate that there is a line 
item for Labour Market Development Agreement programs of 
22 million, whereas last year there was no expenditure in that 
line item. 
 
You’ve said that there’s been a reshuffling in terms of bringing 
around agencies. Could you explain where the various 
departments have come from and how that figure of 22 million 
. . . What kinds of needs will the 22 million address as far as the 
students in the . . . not only students I guess, but adults who are 
seeking training programs? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Well the money is prorated; it’s not a 
full-year money, it’s based on the amount of time that we’ll 
actually be responsible for the agreement this year. And I’m just 
going from memory; it’s 70 employees . . . 114 altogether, 
pardon me. And when this is fully complete, I will have 
full-year funding and all the employees will be moved over. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — When you say moved over, that’s the 
explanation that I’m looking for, Madam Minister. Where are 
they coming from, where were they located before, what are 
they doing, and how will that now reallocate into your 
department to meet the needs that you have? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — I think most people would be fairly 
familiar with the work the employment centres do — its 
placement, its career counselling. The one function we aren’t 
taking over from them is the Employment Insurance cheques. 
We don’t do that; we just provide the labour market and 
training services to people. 
 
They currently have 17 locations in the province. So one of the 
things we’ll be doing over the next year is trying to figure out 
how to bring the offices together — the Human Resource 
Development offices that were previously federal, with the 
regional college services, with the New Careers services. And 
we’ll be looking to co-locate wherever that doesn’t . . . it 
already exists in some places. And we’ll be looking for what the 
community’s view is of the best way to do that co-location and 
the best location for that region. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Minister. Another area in 
the estimates are in the area of New Careers, and you’ve 
mentioned that terminology today. What was the specific role, I 
guess . . . New Careers has been around for a long time, the 
corporation itself. What was the mission statement? What did 
New Careers attempt to accomplish and what were its 
objectives? 

 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — It was really employment readiness 
programs for social assistance recipients. What we’ve done, as 
we’re transforming the program, is tie it more tightly to jobs. 
Because some of the activity they did was important in 
developing work skills and getting an attachment to the labour 
force. 
 
But what we’ve tried to do in the newest transformations to the 
program is to have it more labour market attached, and more 
attached to real jobs. 
 
We’re wanting to, I guess, get as many people participating 
permanently in the labour force as we can through these 
expenditures. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Your footnote, Madam Minister, indicates 
that New Careers Corporation will be disestablishing during 
1998-99. Will this have any significance on the people who are 
receiving social assistance right now, as far as whether or not 
there will be another avenue for them to secure training? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — I think the best way to explain that is 
there is still the News Careers route. The only thing that’s 
changing is the stronger attachment to the labour market. 
There’s a basic education component, as now, that’s required as 
well. And also it will be delivered more in conjunction with the 
programs that were previously federally delivered through the 
Labour Market Agreement, the HR (human resources) services 
that were delivered. 
 
But also there’s a provincial training allowance as well that may 
pick up some of those folks who, instead of going directly into a 
job setting, want to further their education as their main 
endeavour. And the provincial training allowance covers people 
up until they graduate from grade 12. It’s the precursor to the 
student loan for post-secondary. 
 
The main difference is that we’re trying to work more with 
employers rather than managing the employment ourselves. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Madam Minister, I’m aware of a number of 
communities who have taken advantage of New Careers 
Corporation and have had facilities constructed, have had 
renovations. School divisions have even used New Careers in 
the past. I’m not sure how long they’ve been in existence, but 
I’m sure it’s a number of years. 
 
I’m wondering whether or not that void now, the fact that New 
Careers disappears, are there communities now that won’t be 
able to receive or won’t be able to complete projects that, you 
know, they had relied on New Careers before? Because as I 
said, I know of a number of communities that have had projects 
completed and sponsored by New Careers, where New Careers 
was very heavily involved and actually completed the additions 
of buildings. 
 
Now with the phasing out of New Careers Corporation, is there 
any replacement for that by way of another project? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — I’ll give you a two-part answer. One 
part is the workers — they can still get the workers; the 
difference is we will no longer have our own supervisors and

what not on site. The people who have the workers have to take 
responsibility for the supervision. 
And the other difference is there was some equipment that was 
owned by New Careers Corporation, and it’s our intention that 
that equipment continued to be used for the purposes it was 
purchased within communities. So people who have an 
established history of providing services similar to what New 
Careers was doing in the community, there’s a process for them 
to apply to be considered to retain some of that equipment. 
 
(1645) 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — If I understand you correctly, Madam 
Minister, you’re saying then that if a community group, a 
municipality, or an ad hoc committee at a community level, 
desires to renovate the senior citizens’ club, they can now make 
applications through JobStart-Future Skills for people who were 
currently . . . or previously under New Careers; and that now 
they can access that employment of the same type of things. 
 
I understand that mileage was one of the criteria or expenses 
that was incurred by projects before when New Careers was 
involved. Will those same type of financial arrangements, will 
they still exist under this new plan? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Yes, they’ll just phone the same people 
they used to phone. We sort of have a package of employment 
programs and they’ll pick the particular package that suits the 
circumstance that they have the best. And certainly they’ll be 
expected, not just to keep people busy, but also for there to be 
an active learning component on the job. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Minister. I’m not sure 
whether this is a question that I should direct to your 
department or whether it’s through SPMC (Saskatchewan 
Property Management Corporation), but I’m aware that a 
particular facility in the community of Kamsack was 
constructed for New Careers Corporation and that, indeed over 
the last I believe 10 years, there has been a rent paid on an 
empty building that’s been sitting in Kamsack, by I believe . . . 
the expense would have been incurred by New Careers or was it 
just an expense incurred by SPMC? 
 
And the second question, it’s my understanding that the 
building has now been sold. Would it now be a liability that 
your department has removed from your liability list? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Well I hate to disappoint you, but I 
guess you are going to have to ask SPMC, because we were a 
tenant, but not the landlord, and we didn’t pay the cost of the 
building itself. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Over the last 10 years then New Careers 
Corporation was not assessed the costs of the rental of that 
building in Kamsack? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — We’re not aware of that at the moment, 
but we’ll check it out and bring it back for you. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Madam Minister. And 
the other question I would like to know is whether or not New 
Careers Corporation has been involved with the actual selling of 
that building. If you could bring that information forward, I’d 

appreciate that somewhere down the road. 
 
When JobStart-Future Skills, your money that you’ve indicated 
that you provide to the various industries, are you providing it 
to the industry as a whole? Are you providing some funding to 
companies as well? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — The planning money for doing 
sector-wide planning goes to industry, but the actual on-the-job 
training component goes to the particular industry . . . or the 
particular employer that’s doing the training — the particular 
company. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — I’m not sure whether that request is in our 
globals, Madam Minister, but I’d appreciate if you could 
provide us with a listing of the employers or companies that 
receive grants. Would that be possible? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — We can certainly do that. Yes. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Madam Minister. 
Madam Minister, the post-secondary area of the university area 
has been looking I guess patiently at the MacKay report and the 
kinds of suggestions that it has made. 
 
I guess the first question that I have for you this afternoon is: 
with the initiatives that were put forth in the MacKay report, 
what have you as minister seen occur regarding some of the 
suggestions that were suggested by the report and the kinds of 
things that might be happening in the near future? Could you 
give us a summary of some of the things that you see happening 
between the two universities in this province? 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — This is quite a big load. Do you want 
me to go through the whole thing? It’s essentially . . . under 
MacKay, it was a process of identifying some of the things the 
universities needed to work on and then to set up some 
structures for them to work on those things together. 
 
And there was three levels of committees set up — one actually 
at the Premier and the president’s level, another one at the 
deputy’s and senior people in the university level, and then 
there’s some administrative work that goes on as well. 
 
They’ve done a number of things in the area of administrative 
efficiency. I’ll just give you a couple of examples because 
there’s long lists: sharing internal audit personnel between the 
universities; joint discussions on uniformity of financial 
statements for easier comparison; collaboration in assessing a 
renewal of major administrative information and library 
computer systems; procurement cards for efficiency of 
purchasing. 
 
In recruitments and admissions, there’s been a number of 
developments such as a CD-ROM (compact disc read-only 
memory). In program collaboration, there’s joint deans’ 
meetings; there’s lecture and seminar exchanges; there’s 
video-linked graduate course in English. 
 
There’s promotion of engineering in the high schools in 
association with the Association of Professional Engineers. 
There’s electronic exchange of engineering courses. There’s a 
number of other things I haven’t mentioned, but that gives you 



1140 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 1998 

a flavour for it. 
 
Under program development, there’s a joint certificate program 
in occupational health and safety; joint development of the 
technology assisted adult in continuing education certificate 
program. 
 
There’s a funding review going on right now by DesRosiers on 
the appropriate formula for funding universities and the factors 
that should be taken into consideration. And that study will also 
include the federated colleges and everybody’s waiting eagerly 
for that. Although all parties have been involved in the 
development of that, we’ll probably be sitting down in the next 
few months to discuss the recommendation that DesRosiers is 
making on university funding. 
 
The committee reported progress.
