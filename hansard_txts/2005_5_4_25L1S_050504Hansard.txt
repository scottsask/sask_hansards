May 4, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2863 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and through 
you is a lady I would like to introduce, a friend of mine, a lady 
behind the bar that all of us know very well, the former member 
from Humboldt. When we come into politics, there’s many 
things we learn, and one of the things that we learn is that we 
can develop friendships that last a lifetime. So I’d like all 
members to help me welcome Arlene Julé back to the 
legislature. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kindersley. 
 

Anniversary of Liberation of Holland 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Mr. Speaker. It is with great pride that I rise 
today to pay tribute to our veterans who participated in the 
liberation of Holland from the Nazis 60 years ago this month. 
Of the 40,000 Canadians who lost their lives during World War 
II, 7,000 died during the liberation of Holland. It was a 
tremendous sacrifice and because of their efforts, the 
Netherlands was liberated by the First Canadian Army on May 
5, 1945. 
 
Saskatchewan veterans played a key role in that campaign. The 
Estevan-based South Saskatchewan Regiment was among the 
Canadian troops which liberated 861 inmates from Kamp 
Westerbork, a Nazi concentration camp, on April 12, 1945. It 
was, as one veteran has noted, a day that made you proud to be 
Canadian. 
 
Thousands of veterans and relatives from across Canada will 
visit Holland this year to take part in the 60th anniversary 
celebrations and ceremonies. There they will meet with locals, 
visit former battlegrounds, and salute their comrades who were 
killed in action. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I have travelled to the Netherlands, and I can tell 
you that their appreciation for Canadians is unparalleled 
anywhere in the world. There are Canadian flags everywhere 
and monuments everywhere. And it’s very fitting that Holland 
has continued to be such a close friend of the Canadian 
government. We have 2,200 war veterans. Our largest force and 
largest Canadian cemetery outside of Canada is in Holland. 
 
I would ask members of the Assembly to join me today in 
expressing our gratitude to our veterans for their role in the 
liberation of Holland, and the sacrifice made by the 7,000 
Canadians who gave their lives to secure our friend Holland’s 
country’s freedom. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Elphinstone. 

Hepatitis C Awareness 
 
Mr. McCall: — Mr. Speaker, May 1 was National Hepatitis C 
Awareness Day in Canada and the beginning of Hepatitis C 
Awareness Month. This is significant, Mr. Speaker, because 
awareness is one of the best weapons we have with which to 
fight the spread of this disease. 
 
And so, Mr. Speaker, I was very pleased on Sunday to have had 
the opportunity to say a few words at the opening of the third 
National Aboriginal Hepatitis C Conference that is taking place 
here in Regina. Mr. Speaker, the incidence of acute hepatitis C 
infection among the Aboriginal population is on average seven 
times higher than that observed in the non-Aboriginal 
Canadian-born population. 
 
Conference participants from a variety of fields of expertise and 
experience have come from all across Canada to share ideas and 
find solutions to the problem of hepatitis C. The conference 
theme is Building Stronger Families and Communities and is 
about finding ways to provide holistic, culturally relevant 
education and support. Conference organizers stress the need to 
increase awareness of the key issues surrounding hepatitis C for 
Aboriginal people with emphasis on prevention, diagnosis, 
treatment, and self-management. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I have no doubt that real progress is being made 
here in Regina this week. I want to acknowledge the main 
conference organizer, Margaret Akan, and host organization All 
Nations Hope AIDS Network, the host organization of this 
year’s conference, as well as all the individuals and 
organizations responsible for putting together this important 
event of building community and healing lives. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Southeast. 
 

Autism Treatment Services Holds Spring Gala 
 
Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, last Saturday I had the privilege 
of attending the eighth annual Spring Gala held by a non-profit 
group, the Autism Treatment Services of Saskatchewan, Inc. As 
well as an interesting evening of music performed by jazz 
vocalist Lyne Tremblay, I sat with two families that had autistic 
children. The event was highly successful and no doubt raised a 
substantial amount of money for the organization. 
 
This organization has existed since 1979. It was initially started 
as a parent support group and has now evolved into a program 
delivery agent to deliver specialized programs that deal with 
autism. 
 
[13:45] 
 
Autism is a lifelong neurological disorder that affects a person’s 
development and how their brain processes information. 
Individuals with autism experience challenges in the areas of 
communication, social interaction, and maintaining 
relationships. While there is no cure for autism, it is highly 
treatable. Early diagnosis and intervention greatly increase the 



2864 Saskatchewan Hansard May 4, 2005 

functionality of the individual. Consistent individualized 
programming, while expensive, can produce significant 
benefits. 
 
During my time on the Saskatoon public school board, there 
was a strong commitment to providing trained teaching 
assistants and developing positive programs. Autism is a huge 
challenge for the individuals affected and also for their families. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask all MLAs [Member of the 
Legislative Assembly] to make themselves aware of autism 
issues in this province, and I would like to ask MLAs to 
congratulate the Autism Treatment Services organization for a 
job well done. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Eastview. 
 

National Mental Health Week 
 
Ms. Junor: — Mr. Speaker, this is National Mental Health 
Week, and the theme for this year is Mind and Body Fitness. 
It’s a time to create awareness about the important connection 
between physical and mental health and to promote activities 
that stimulate an overall sense of well-being. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Saskatchewan division of the Canadian Mental 
Health Association is one of the oldest and largest 
community-based human service organizations in the province. 
Throughout the years, it has depended, and continues to depend, 
on a small but dedicated staff and a large number of volunteers 
to accomplish its goals. 
 
Mr. Speaker, National Mental Health Week is a focal point of 
their efforts to raise awareness about the various issues 
associated with mental health and mental illness. The staff and 
volunteers work to erase the stigma of mental illness, educate 
the public about mental health issues, provide support to those 
living with mental illness, and help them live a better quality of 
life. 
 
Mr. Speaker, having good mental health enables us to more 
fully enjoy and appreciate our environment and the people in it. 
We can often better resist stress and tackle our life’s challenges 
in a positive frame of mind. 
 
In recent years, there has a been a shift towards a more holistic 
approach to mental health. The World Health Organization 
defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and 
social well-being. Given this, it is fitting that this year’s theme 
is Mind and Body Fitness. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in expressing 
our appreciation to the staff and volunteers of the Saskatchewan 
division of the Canadian Mental Health Association for 
improving the lives of many and in turn making an impact on 
our entire community. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 

Mountain-Touchwood. 
 

A Dutch Family’s Experience in World War II 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this week 
as our veterans gather in Holland, along with our leaders, to 
celebrate the liberation of Holland and celebrate VE Day, I’d 
like to talk for a moment about a young, married Dutch couple 
that lived in Holland during that period of time that country was 
occupied, Mr. Speaker, and relate some of the conditions that 
they were forced to live under. 
 
I would like to talk about a couple, Jon and Johanna 
Vanderloos, who were newly married and who were forced to 
billet German soldiers . . . Who had to horde food, Mr. Speaker, 
so that they could have enough to survive on. Who were forced 
to work for the German army at various tasks including erecting 
fence posts in meadows to prevent Allied planes from landing. 
And who had nothing . . . no firewood at night, Mr. Speaker, to 
keep them warm so they would go out in the middle of the night 
and cut some of these posts for firewood, and did that at the risk 
of death. 
 
And on their way home in the darkness of night would hear 
someone coming down the path and hide in the ditch, Mr. 
Speaker, with the shovel in hand, knowing that if it was a 
German soldier they would be faced with a kill-or-be-killed 
situation. And oftentimes would be very relieved to find 
neighbours doing exactly the same thing, Mr. Speaker. Who 
had young mothers with their families come to their door and 
knock on their door and beg for potato peelings so they could 
make soup, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Those are some of the conditions that that family had to live 
under, Mr. Speaker, and I would ask all members of this 
Assembly to acknowledge the strength and courage of the 
Dutch people to survive the horrors of war. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for The 
Battlefords. 
 

Battlefords Business Excellence Awards 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was very 
fortunate last evening to be in attendance at the 12th annual 
Battlefords Business Excellence Awards hosted by the 
Battlefords Chamber of Commerce to recognize the outstanding 
accomplishments of the thriving Battlefords business 
community. 
 
I would ask all members to acknowledge and congratulate this 
year’s winners, which include the Heritage Award, sponsored 
by BCU Financial, given to Bill and Don’s Men’s Wear; the 
Community Contribution Award, sponsored by SaskEnergy, 
won by Kal Tire; the Young Entrepreneur Award, sponsored by 
RBC Royal Bank, won by North Battleford Massage; the 
Marketing Award, sponsored by SaskPower, won by Scott 
Campbell Dodge; the New Business Award, sponsored by SGI 
[Saskatchewan Government Insurance], won by Boston Pizza; 
the Customer Service Award, sponsored by CIBC [Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce], won by Meckling Delivery and 



May 4, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2865 

Moving; and the 2005 BBEX Business of the Year Award, 
sponsored by SaskTel, won by BCU Financial. 
 
I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the people that 
organized this outstanding event honouring the very best of our 
business community. This includes the organizing committee 
Co-Chairs, Marla Kerr and Rob Rongve, and the MC [master of 
ceremonies], a long-time BBEX committee member, David 
Dekker. And I also want to acknowledge our own award maker 
and master craftsman, Stan Wychopen who in honour of 
Saskatchewan’s centennial year crafted an extraordinary 
miniature of Walter Scott’s legislative desk, given to each of the 
winners. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 

Treatment for Drug Addicted Youth 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, I would like to update this 
Assembly on the young lady with the drug addiction whose 
family came to the legislature last week. We all know her as 
Mary. I was informed that late last night Mary was taken into 
custody and put into a youth facility. Her grandparents and 
mother are relieved and delighted she is out of harm’s way for 
the time being. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this only happened because the family had the 
courage and the strength to come to this legislature and demand 
a meeting with the minister and get the highest level of 
government in this province involved. My question to the 
minister is this: is this what other families are going to have to 
go through to get the same results? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
And certainly after a very trying week, I’m glad that we have 
the report of this stage of the outcome that we have today. 
 
What I would like to say is that our section 18 has different 
provisions for youth 15 and under as it does for youth 17 and 
under. And when I agreed to apply the rather unusual measures 
of section 18 to this age of youth, it was to test the ability of our 
provisions to have the desired effect so that we could make a 
final determination of how we may want to amend section 18. 
And so I will be following very carefully what happens in this 
circumstance regarding the success of this intervention. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, most families don’t want to have 
to come to the legislature and get the minister involved. They 

want to have something done immediately so they can do it in 
their own hometown. 
 
The private member’s Bill I introduced last week does two 
important things. First of all, it allows parents to get children 
with addictions out of dangerous situations. And the second 
thing is it helps parents allow their children to go into 
mandatory addiction treatment. I understand the minister is 
looking at modifying section 18 to ensure parents can 
apprehend children 18 and under. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what I don’t see here is where the mandatory 
treatment comes into play. Mr. Speaker, my question, and the 
question on the minds of parents whose children are involved in 
drugs, is simply this: does the minister support the idea of 
mandatory treatment? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a 
balance of opinion on both sides of the question regarding 
mandatory treatment. But I think I would fall on the side of 
people and parents who believe that better to err on the side of 
protection of youth than to have a disaster as a result of not 
having done that. 
 
At the moment, we have no secure custody in the province for 
youth who have not committed a crime under the Youth 
Criminal Justice Act. So one of the things I’m looking at at the 
same time as we’re looking at amendments to the Bill is the 
availability of closed custody facilities where we are not, in 
fact, bringing drug addicted youth who may not have a criminal 
record into contact with other youth who have a criminal 
record. 
 
So with this kind of a question there’s legal issues, there’s 
addiction treatment issues, and there’s resource issues. And I 
want to make sure that we’ve answered all of those as we move 
ahead. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, I’d like to thank the minister for 
giving us her assurance that she believes that mandatory 
treatment would be the right way to go. I’ve recently received a 
letter from a teacher in Saskatchewan and I’m going to call this 
teacher Anne as she doesn’t want her name used. Twenty years 
ago Anne was 15 and she was addicted to drugs. Her parents 
put her into mandatory treatment in the United States. She 
writes: 
 

If I hadn’t been committed to alcohol and drug treatment 
when I was 15 years old, I know I wouldn’t be the 
successful adult I am . . . [today]. 
 
Believe me, if I could have walked out of there when I got 
there or when things got rough, I would have. But because 



2866 Saskatchewan Hansard May 4, 2005 

I was locked in . . . [and] forced to look at my addiction 
and what it was doing to me and my family [I survived]. 
 

Mr. Speaker, how soon and where is the option that the minister 
is looking for for mandatory treatment? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Community Resources and Employment. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
think the two final questions, aside from those I’ve already 
mentioned about the actual secure custody facilities with the 
appropriate staff to receive the youth, the other issue is both of 
the Bill that has been put forward by the member opposite, and 
our section 18, contemplate going before a court for the court to 
order the mandatory treatment. So you still have to meet a test 
of competency regarding whether the youth is competent to be 
making their own decisions or whether in fact there’s a question 
of ability to make those judgments. So the other question to 
answer is how high the test is for competency because in either 
process it still contemplates a court-ordered decision. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, again I agree with the minister. 
These are all questions that have to be answered but they have 
to be answered quickly. We are right now talking about a 
growing epidemic in this province and across Canada. We’ve 
been knowing that there’s been an issue here in the legislature 
for one year. We have the Minister of Health said he knew 
about it for six years. We don’t have the right to just sit there 
and talk about it any more. We have to get people looking at the 
answers to this question. 
 
In the paper today we have: 
 

Lanoie, who is a member of the Canadian Society of 
Addiction Medicine, said he is really not opposed to the 
province mandating treatment for young people addicted 
to drugs. 
 
“Studies have shown people do just as well in mandated 
treatment as if they step up to . . . [do it] voluntarily,” . . . 
“The problem is we . . . don’t have . . . [the] facilities, 
[and] we need a lot of residential treatment facilities, 
especially for crystal meth and . . . cocaine,” . . . 

 
Mr. Speaker, the question is, how quickly are we going to be 
able to help the children in our province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for CRE 
[Community Resources and Employment]. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Again, Mr. Speaker, I will say that 
there is a large number of things being done, as was reported by 
the member from Sutherland, the special Legislative Secretary, 

and the Minister of Health. 
 
We did recently announce many prevention, treatment, 
education, and reduction of supplies used to make the drug 
initiatives. There is a public awareness campaign. There is more 
services to help youth withdraw from alcohol and drugs, more 
brief detox services for short-term stays, more community 
outreach, and in fact in the North, a mobile outreach. So there’s 
been a substantial increase in services. 
 
Where we still need to respond is on the area of closed custody 
services which will require the development of resources that 
do not currently exist in the province. This is why, Mr. Speaker, 
though Alberta is taking a year, we don’t wish to take a year. 
But we do have to make sure that when we receive that youth, 
that in fact there is a closed custody response in those 
situations. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Batoche. 
 

Rebate Program for Energy Savings 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
Saskatchewan’s rebate for green appliances has proven to be 
extremely popular. Ten thousand people have received rebates 
after purchasing Energy Star compliant appliances. Mr. 
Speaker, those rebates have been worth just over $700,000. 
 
Mr. Speaker, will this program be expanded to include other 
energy-efficient home heating technologies? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. As 
Minister Responsible for the Office of Energy Conservation, 
it’s a delight to stand up and talk about the good work that’s 
been accomplished by the PST [provincial sales tax] rebate. 
And as we know in the budget this year, it’s been established 
that no longer will people have to pay the PST on these Energy 
Star appliances at the point of sale. 
 
So this is good news. This is great news for the people of 
Saskatchewan. And it’s actually . . . We’ve had something over 
20,000 appliances in this program that have been sold. So good 
news for Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Batoche. 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Mr. Speaker, a geothermal system uses the 
earth’s thermal properties and electricity to heat buildings. For 
every unit of electricity it uses, a geothermal system returns 
four times as much heat. These systems are hugely efficient and 
save a lot of money. 
 
Mr. Speaker, will the government consider a rebate program for 
geothermal heating systems?

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We’re always 
examining options like this and we’re interested in hearing 
about the good ideas from everyone in the province. Obviously 
people in Saskatchewan value wise use of energy and so we’ll 
be happy to examine this type of thing. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Batoche. 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Mr. Speaker, Manitoba Hydro calls geothermal 
one of the most comfortable, energy-efficient, and 
environmentally responsible home heating and cooling systems 
available. Manitoba is offering loans up to $15,000 repayable 
on monthly utility bills. Mr. Speaker, when will Saskatchewan 
be offering a similar program? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, as we examine the whole 
range of options out there, we want to make sure they apply in 
an appropriate way here to Saskatchewan. Manitoba has some 
unique opportunities there, but we do some really innovative 
things here. SaskEnergy with their high-energy-efficient 
furnaces is a great option for people here in Saskatchewan. So 
we want to make sure it’s the right fit and it’s the right package 
for people here in Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Contract Negotiations with Nurses 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In the next few 
days, teachers around the province are going to be voting on a 
tentative agreement that they have reached with this provincial 
government. Now let’s remember this agreement is a great 
deviation from what was the Premier’s wage mandate at 0, 1, 
and 1. In fact the teachers will be voting on 2, 2, and 2 plus. 
 
SUN, Saskatchewan Union of Nurses, are currently at the 
bargaining table in Regina. Can the nurses expect the same 
treatment from this Minister of Health as the teachers received 
from the minister of Education, a deviation from 0, 1, and 1? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for CRE. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Mr. Speaker, certainly we have made 
the point that where the flexibility lies in the agreement is 
where a case can be made for issues like recruitment and 
retention, special issues in the workplace. And you know, Mr. 
Speaker, it has been the history of settlements regarding both 
teachers and nurses that these factors have come to bear. 
 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. SUN has 
repeatedly asked SAHO [Saskatchewan Association of Health 
Organizations], and I quote, “for further clarification and 
disclosure around monetary issues.” Yet SUN argues that 
SAHO is unwilling to or unable to provide any of this 
disclosure. 
 
So I’ll ask the Minister of Health: is it a firm 0, 1, and 1 
mandate — yes or no? 
 
If the answer is no, then I guess to the Minister of Culture, 
Youth and Recreation: if there’s flexibility which she talks 
about, is that flexibility around the monetary issues on this 
upcoming contract? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister responsible 
for the public service board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is 
coming dangerously close to collective bargaining on the floor 
of the legislature and I think we’ll just leave that at the table. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, the minister of Education 
went public saying that there is more money on the table than 
the 0, 1, and 1 mandate. I’m simply asking the minister, is the 
same agreement available for nurses? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister for the 
public service board. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Mr. Speaker, if the members opposite 
believe in collective bargaining, they will give this process 
room to unfold. And I can guarantee them that when the people 
representing those at the bargaining table come forward to 
discuss special issues with us, certainly that is considered as it 
is in every other agreement. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, monetary issues are only one 
issue that is being discussed at the bargaining table. 
 
Nurses for years have been telling this government that they 
need more full-time, permanent jobs to ensure safe staffing 
levels. It appears that the government is refusing to ensure safe 
staffing levels after the last round of negotiations, and we quote 
from what SUN had to say: 
 

. . . the employers’ refusal to adequately staff units is the 
main cause of their inability to maintain appropriate levels 



2868 Saskatchewan Hansard May 4, 2005 

of RNs [and] RPNs to provide safe patient care. 
 
Mr. Speaker, nurses have been calling for greater staffing levels 
for years. Is he willing to jeopardize patient safety for a lack of 
nursing jobs in this province? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, in October we had a national 
meeting of the provinces, the territories, and the federal 
government, and there was a 10-year plan around health care 
which included a plan around health human resources. And one 
aspect of that, it does include safety of the workplace and all of 
the related issues. And I’m pleased to say that when we got our 
first allocation of dollars, we committed a substantial portion of 
that to deal with safety issues. 
 
We’ll continue to work with the employees and with 
management to make sure that we have safe workplaces and 
that they can provide good care for our Saskatchewan citizens. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 

Powers of Labour Relations Board 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Bill 
No. 87, An Act to amend The Trade Union Act, has a lot of 
people concerned. I would like the minister to clarify something 
for this Assembly about the powers this Bill gives to the Labour 
Relations Board. My question is: will an individual representing 
the Labour Relations Board have the power to seize evidence or 
information from a workplace? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Well, Mr. Speaker, here’s another 
example of the opposition ignoring the facts. All you have to 
do, Mr. Speaker, when we’re talking about the amendments to 
The Trade Union Act, I would recommend that the members 
opposite review section 18 of the Act, and it currently provides 
the Labour Relations Board with broad general powers. And 
Mr. Speaker, what these amendments are meant to do, and what 
they will do, is clarify those powers for the board which, Mr. 
Speaker, will provide more timely decisions. And the people on 
this side of the House believe that’s a good way to work. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Labour was asked a very 
specific question in her scrum about Bill 87 and the powers of 
the Labour Relations Board. A reporter asked the following, 
quote, “And with this Bill the board will be able to seize and 
access some information.” To which the minister replied, and I 
quote, “Yes, if it is relative to the case, yes, they will.” 

Mr. Speaker, I have the Bill in my hand. I would like this 
minister to stand and point out the clause that grants an 
individual the right to seize property. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, if the members opposite 
wish to get into the detailed answers on Bill 87, we could do 
that in committee where we would have more detailed answers 
and more time. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the members opposite 
that these are powers that the board currently has. And what it 
would allow for is gathering information for conducting 
certification or decertification votes, determining how many 
employees there are and who is an employee and, Mr. Speaker, 
determining which employees might be management employees 
and therefore excluded from the bargaining units. Mr. Speaker, 
these are all very relevant and important to many of the cases 
brought before the Labour Relations Board. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, very 
clearly the section that the minister has referred to, section 18 of 
this Bill, indicates that in sections (f) and (g) there is the ability 
to enter any premises and to inspect and view — inspect and 
view, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday the minister in her scrum in the 
rotunda said, if they decide will there have . . . Will the person 
or the individual representing the Labour Relations Board have 
the ability to seize any information from that workplace? The 
minister responded, yes, they will. 
 
Will the minister clarify whether or not the individual 
representing the Labour Relations Board, will that individual 
have the power to seize any records, any material from that 
workplace? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — What I will say is, no, not any material, 
any . . . I mean that is pretty broad scope, broad scale. The 
member opposite is distorting the facts and not being accurate 
in the facts that are presented in this Bill or these amendments. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with respect to these amendments and to the 
powers of the Labour Relations Board and access to 
workplaces, this is not a radical move and it is prevalent in 
other jurisdictions across Canada. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — The minister suggests that there be some 
material that might be necessary. This Bill is granting an 
individual the right to enter premises. The minister said 



May 4, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2869 

yesterday in her scrum, it also will allow them to seize, seize 
information — information that this individual may deem 
necessary. Judges have to grant that information to police 
officers, that ability to enter and confiscate material. This 
minister is indicating that a Labour Relations Board 
representative will have the right to seize information. I want 
her to stand in this Assembly and clarify what information she 
will decide on as being relevant to the ability of that 
information to be confiscated. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, with regards to these 
amendments proposed for the Labour Relations Board, 
clarifying their powers and also clarifying access to workplaces 
to gather information that may be relevant to the cases before 
them, Mr. Speaker, this power is in six other jurisdictions across 
this country and it is not unusual. 
 
But what is unusual, Mr. Speaker, is those members opposite 
who hop from one side of the issue to the other. One member 
gets up and supports workers, supports free collective 
bargaining, proposes to be the kinder, softer Saskatchewan 
Party. But, Mr. Speaker, the people of Saskatchewan aren’t 
fooled. They’re the same as they were four years ago, same as 
they were six months ago. They disagree with labour 
legislation, they disagree with supporting working people in this 
province; and this government will continue the work it’s 
doing. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 

Consultation Regarding Labour Legislation 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, what the opposition disagrees with 
is labour legislation that hurts both employers and employees 
because it casts a chill over the provincial economy and turns 
away investment into the province of Saskatchewan. That’s 
what the opposition has a concern . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order, please. Leader 
of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The election of fall ’03 
the Premier was asked by the Saskatoon Chamber of Commerce 
what major labour changes he had planned. And here’s what he 
said in a letter back to the chamber of commerce. This is what 
the Premier of the province said — no legislation changes 
would occur without extensive consultations with all 
stakeholders. 
 
The question today is simple to this Premier or his designate: 
what constitutes, in their mind and the mind of this government, 
extensive consultations? Are extensive consultations 
introducing those major changes in legislation and then waiting 
for the phone to ring or for meetings to be requested by the 
business community or any other stakeholder? 
 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, in the Leader-Post dated June 9, 2004 the Leader of 
the Opposition said: 
 

“Saskatchewan could be a ‘have’ province if it cut taxes, 
stopped competing with the private sector and reformed its 
restrictive labour laws” [says Saskatchewan Party leader]. 
 

Mr. Speaker, I will tell the member opposite we are a have 
province, have been for a couple of years. And the access to 
workplace portion in the amendments to The Trade Union Act 
are also in the Alberta Labour Relations Board Act. And, Mr. 
Speaker, it’s not restrictive, it’s common practice, and it’s 
needed for the board to do its work. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, the minister better be careful in 
what she’s saying to this Assembly because powers of seizure 
are not common across this province when it comes to Labour 
Relations Board. They are not. The question to the minister 
though is simple and direct if she cares to answer: does she 
view extensive consultation with stakeholders, is it her opinion 
that those kinds of consultations are represented by introducing 
legislation and then waiting for her phone to ring? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, when we look at some of 
the comments that the members opposite have made . . . And he 
talked about our restricting investment in this province. And in 
a scrum in the legislature he said, and I quote: 
 

We do not need anything unique here, but what we need is 
competitive . . . we need to be competitive in terms of our 
labour legislation. 

 
[14:15] 
 
This is not unique, Mr. Speaker. This is in other jurisdictions. 
Both of our neighbouring provinces have the access to 
workplaces. He also made the comment that it would be 
restrictive to investment in the province of Saskatchewan. And I 
know the Minister of Industry and Resources has said it many 
times, but I’ll repeat it for the members opposite, investment in 
Saskatchewan was $7.5 billion and it’s projected by Stats Can 
[Statistics Canada] to be 8.5 this coming year, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Is it any wonder that this government, this NDP 
[New Democratic Party] government, and that minister, lose 
credibility with the people of the province every single day 
when they hear answers like that? We know that powers of 
seizure are not common across the country. They are simply not 



2870 Saskatchewan Hansard May 4, 2005 

common across this country. Mr. Speaker, you don’t have to 
take the word of the official opposition when it comes to 
whether or not this government has any credibility when it 
commits to consultation. Here is what the Saskatchewan 
Construction Association executive director said in the 
Leader-Post today. He said, quote: 
 

“They’ve learned nothing from the available hours,” . . . 
“They introduce the Bill in the legislature and they assume 
that’s consultation. [He goes on to say] That’s not 
consultation.” 
 

I want the minister to stand in her place today and explain to the 
stakeholders of the economy of this province on both the labour 
side and the management side, if her view of extensive 
consultation she thinks is shared by them — that being, 
introducing a Bill, writing, drafting a Bill, introducing it in the 
House, and then waiting for her phone to ring or for a meeting 
to be requested. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, over the period of time of 
the last number of months there has been a great deal of 
consultation that has gone on, on the whole package of labour 
legislation that is currently tabled in the House, and also the 
additional hours piece, Mr. Speaker. It was quite public. I had 
many presentations from a variety of groups. And, Mr. Speaker, 
when anyone has contacted me for a meeting, or they have sent 
. . . we have accommodated them. Now if they have cancelled 
the meeting, Mr. Speaker, that’s entirely their business. Mr. 
Speaker, we have also . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order, please. The Minister of 
Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, we have also received a 
number of written comments from various business 
representatives across the province. Mr. Speaker, while the 
member opposite says he does not think we need anything 
unique in this province, I would ask him then, does that mean 
he would do away with three weeks of holidays, which is 
unique to Saskatchewan? Does that mean that he would get rid 
of our parental leave, which is better than Alberta, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. 
 

ORDERS OF THE DAY
