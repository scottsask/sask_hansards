INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Massey Place, the Minister for Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’m 
very happy today to be able to rise in the Assembly and 
introduce to you and through you to all members of the 
Assembly a group of 55 grade 5 students who are seated in the 
west gallery. And after listening to all those Bills, I’m sure 
they’re looking forward to touring the building and doing some 
other activities here in Regina today. And these students, Mr. 
Speaker, are accompanied by teachers Linda Kindrachuk, Larry 
Deacon, and Lorraine Theisson and also chaperones Kevin 
Arno, Barry Crockett, Kevin Lucas, Tina Dorn, and Audry 
Heintz. 
 
And I want to say while I’m on my feet, Mr. Speaker, that 
Dundonald School — which is the school actually that you 
visited with your Speaker’s tour along with me — is, as you 
know, one of the nicest schools in Saskatoon. And in fact 
several years ago it was expanded, and it’s considered to be one 
of the best schools in Saskatoon too and a school of choice for 
people that live in the Dundonald area. And I’m very proud to 
represent Dundonald in the legislature. 
 
So we’re going to be meeting this afternoon, Mr. Speaker. 
We’ll be having drinks and Dixie cups here, and we’ll be 
talking about the Legislative Assembly. And the students will 
ask me questions, and I’ll be giving some answers. 
 
So I want to ask all members, Mr. Speaker, to join with me and 
welcome these students, the teachers, and chaperones from 
Dundonald School in Saskatoon. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Meadow Lake. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’m 
very happy to be able to introduce to you a special guest of 
mine, to you and to all members of the Assembly, Bob Foster, 
seated in the Speaker’s gallery. Bob started teaching in 1954. 
Taught in Minton, Saskatchewan, actually just out of Regina 



May 9, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1557 

here. And then taught in a number of communities including 
Vanguard, when he left Vanguard in 1974. And he actually tells 
me the last time he was in this Legislative Assembly was just 
over 30 years ago when he was a teacher in Vanguard, brought 
students to this Assembly. 
 
He moved to Meadow Lake in 1975 and taught there till 1988. 
And I know that the member from Saskatoon Centre who 
actually used to be a teacher in Makwa, Saskatchewan, will 
remember Bob very well as well. 
 
Everyone in Meadow Lake and surrounding community has 
either been taught by Bob or knows Bob fairly well. He tells me 
he’s still the most eligible bachelor in Meadow Lake. And he’s 
been a long-time student and adviser of politics and has often 
stopped by my office to offer words of wisdom. 
 
So I’m absolutely thrilled to be able to introduce Bob to the 
Assembly today and welcome him to the legislature again after 
30-some years. Thanks very much. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Centre, the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’d 
like to take this opportunity to introduce to you and through 
you, two members of my staff right if I could now. Krista 
Trettwer, my summer student, as well as Sarah Connor, my new 
ministerial assistant. 
 
And as well just take a moment to also join my colleagues here 
to welcome Bob Foster from my days in Meadow Lake and also 
Larry Deacon, the teacher from Dundonald, who I taught with 
up in Saskatoon. So it’s a pretty special day for old teaching 
alumni. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Rosemont. 
 
Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In your 
gallery I think I noticed slip in my legislative intern for the next 
couple of months, Justine Gilbert. And she is working on the 
music industry review to determine how a Legislative Secretary 
works with the department and with the community to develop 
government policy. So it’s very excellent. And we’re having a 
good time even though she’s working too hard to visit much. 
And I want to thank her for her work and for the legislative 
intern program. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatchewan Rivers. 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I see that we are 
joined by two of my constituents from White Fox. It’s a real 
pleasure to have constituents come such a long distance. They 
are Kent Peterson and Mary Lou Peterson — if they will just 
give a wave — in the Speaker’s gallery. They come all the way 

down from White Fox. 
 
Now I haven’t had a chance to speak with them yet, Mr. 
Speaker, but I suspect they’re here something to do with Kent’s 
decision to attend the University of Regina next fall. I’ll 
indicate, Mr. Speaker, that Kent is graduating from L.P. Miller 
Comprehensive School in Nipawin at the end of June. He has a 
great interest in politics. I definitely see the day when Kent will 
join us here in the legislature, and I’m looking forward to that 
day. I’d like to invite all members to welcome Kent and Mary 
Lou Peterson to the Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Members of the Assembly, it’s my pleasure 
today to introduce two visitors from far, far away — Auckland 
in beautiful New Zealand. They are Karla and Tim Rix-Trott. 
They are friends of our Hansard indexer, Vivien Cartmell who’s 
seated with them in the Speaker’s gallery. 
 
Vivien and Karla met when they were both at the University of 
Dunedin, New Zealand. Karla is a medical doctor with expertise 
in the field of substance abuse, and she is taking a holiday from 
her demanding work. Tim, a retired civil engineer, is taking a 
holiday from the many hours of assistance that he gives to his 
extended family. Please join me in welcoming Karla and Tim to 
the legislature today, and we wish you a very, very pleasant 
visit to Canada and Saskatchewan. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

Youth Business Excellence Awards 
 
Ms. Draude: — This weekend I had the pleasure of attending 
the sixth annual Youth Business Excellence Awards in Tisdale 
sponsored by Newsask Community Futures Development 
Corporation. This program encourages entrepreneurship in 
youth by having young people develop comprehensive business 
plans for starting a business. It doesn’t focus on the amount of 
money made but rather on the skills gained from the experience 
with the hope that the participants will start a business 
themselves one day. 
 
While it’s impossible to name everyone who participated, here 
are a few of the category winners. Mandy Thorson of Porcupine 
Plain won the business venture category with Thorson’s Luxury 
Limo. Steven Dmytriw and Justin Dahroug won the business 
venture category submitted by the group for Muff. Keaton 
Schmitt of Melfort won the business plan category for grades 6 
to 9 for the Pet Person, In-Home Pet Care. Leejay Schmidt of 
Melfort won the business plan category for grades 10 to 12 for 
Doctor Computer. 
 
Andrew Droneck and Blaise Wilson won the business plan 
category for grades 10 to 12 with Quality Moving. Randelle 
Logan and Alana Kewley of Porcupine Plain won the Business 
Info Source Award for Love Smart. Riley Scarf and Troy 
Hagen won the Special Achievement Award for Ace Air Soft 



1558 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

and Paintball Emporium. Douglas Rupps and Kreg Smith of 
Porcupine won the Mike Butler Memorial Award for D.K.’s 
Custom Auto Body and Small Engine Repair. And Carla 
Schmitt of Arborfield won the Agricultural Business Award for 
Carla’s Custom Cattle Clipping. 
 
I’d be amiss not to mention the teacher, Anthony Lau, from 
Porcupine Plain who is like an expectant parent, waited 
nervously to hear how his students made out. 
 
Our youth are our future entrepreneurs, and if the quality of the 
business plans is any indication, Saskatchewan will be in great 
hands in the future. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina

Saskatchewan Youth Award Recipients 
 

Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, May 6 to 
May 12, 2007 is International Youth Week, a time to celebrate 
the energies, talents, and ideas of young people. Here in 
Saskatchewan we have an abundance of dedicated and aspiring 
young people who are deeply involved in shaping their 
communities’ and their province’s future. 
 
Today we honour five of them. I’m pleased today to read into 
the public record the names of the first-ever recipients of the 
Saskatchewan Youth Award — five young people whose 
contributions and achievements have helped to make 
Saskatchewan a better place. They are Kaytlyn Barber of 
Regina Beach, BJ Bodnar of Saskatoon, Valerie Butt of 
Mantario, Lisa Dollansky of Biggar, and Cory Harrower of 
Regina. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I know that you and all members present will join 
me in recognizing these extraordinary young people and paying 
tribute to the quality of youth with which we are blessed in the 
province of Saskatchewan. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

Launch of the Martensville Messenger 
 
Ms. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is a pleasure to 
announce to the Assembly today that the town of Martensville 
will soon be home to a brand new local newspaper. 
Martensville now has a population of more than 5,200 and is 
one of the fastest growing communities in the Saskatoon area. 
The town is clearly ready for a community newspaper. 
 
Christine Lyon, a local resident, business owner, and now 
publisher, saw the need for a local paper, and the new 
Martensville Messenger will be launched on May 26. Lyon 
noted in a press release from last week, and I quote, “The 
Martensville Messenger will be a strong community newspaper, 
based on the support of this busy town and a testament to the 
positive growth and future of many small communities around 

Saskatoon.” 
 

The Martensville Messenger will be similar to other rural 
community newspapers. It will include news, editorial, 
advertising, and classifieds. Initial distribution is set for 2,400 
copies, and the paper will begin publishing monthly with the 
possibility of expanding to a bimonthly publication schedule 
later this year. Mr. Speaker, a website for the Martensville 
Messenger is also being developed and will give local residents 
the opportunity to get information online as well as to submit 
photos, materials for stories, advertising, and classifieds. 
 
I would ask all members of this Assembly to congratulate 
Christine Lyon and her team of the Martensville Messenger on 
the launch of this new community newspaper. Thank you.

Jonas Lariviere Celebrates 100th Birthday 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
This past weekend I had the pleasure of bringing greetings on 
behalf of our Premier and on behalf of the province of 
Saskatchewan to the 100th birthday celebration of a very 
special constituent of mine, FSIN [Federation of Saskatchewan 
Indian Nations] Senator Jonas Lariviere of Canoe Lake. 
 
Mr. Speaker, over 4 to 500 people were there to help celebrate 
Senator Lariviere’s birthday with a Mass, an afternoon 
celebration, supper, and entertainment in the evening. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the senator was born in Pinehouse Lake on May 1, 
1907. One of 14 children, his parents followed a very traditional 
way of life of hunting, of fishing, of trapping, and of course, 
living off the land. The family eventually settled at Canoe 
Narrows but Senator Lariviere continued to follow the 
traditional path his parents taught him throughout his life. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the senator is the oldest resident of the community 
of Canoe Lake, but his many distinctions go far beyond that. 
 
The senator’s knowledge of the Cree cultures, traditions, and 
language, and his political activities has meant that he has 
served as a role model for many. He was one of five founding 
members of the FSIN and has been a senator for many, many 
years. Last year a new health care facility in Canoe Lake was 
named in his honour. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members of the Assembly to join with me 
in offering Senator Lariviere congratulations on his 100th 
birthday, and for his many, many achievements on behalf of the 
province and his community. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

McHappy Day 15th Anniversary 
 
Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, today 
is being marked across Canada as McHappy Day. McDonald’s 
Restaurants of Canada and their franchisees are celebrating the 
15th McHappy Day. 
 
They are doing so by inviting their employees, customers, and 
special guests to work together for one day to raise money for 
children’s charities across Canada, and Ronald McDonald 
houses. One dollar from the sale of every McMuffin, Big Mac, 
and a Happy Meal will go towards charity. 
 
Since 1997, McHappy Days has raised over $22 million for 
Ronald McDonald houses across Canada. The 12 Canadian 
Ronald McDonald houses play a vital role in communities 
across this country, providing a home away from home for the 
family of sick children. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this morning I had the pleasure of working 
alongside the owner and operator of the Weyburn McDonald’s, 
Dave Morfitt, and his staff and several other invited guests for 
the 7:30 shift this morning. 
 
I offer my congratulations to Dave and his staff in Weyburn, 
and all the McDonald’s franchisees who so generously give 
back to their communities. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

Definition of Truth 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — Mr. Speaker, while we have heard a lot of 
odd definitions from the Leader of the Sask Party over the years 
— his strange definition of gutter politics and his weird 
definition of ethical conduct, for example — however, his 
definition of the truth may be the strangest of all, Mr. Speaker. 
 
We all know that the Sask Party has been sitting on illegally 
obtained documents, but for how long? The member from 
Canora-Pelly said last week that the Sask Party had only these 
documents for a few weeks. Oops. It turns out the Leader of the 
Opposition had to issue a correction. The Sask Party has 
actually had these illegally obtained documents for over a year. 
 
But when asked about this discrepancy between the truth and 
the member from Canora-Pelly’s statements, what did the 
Leader of the Sask Party have to say, quote, “Well there’s the 
confusion because Ken answered a question truthfully.” 
 
What a fascinating definition of the word truth, Mr. Speaker. 
Apparently the fact that the statement made by the member 
from Canora-Pelly was completely false has no bearing on the 
truth. Mr. Speaker, according to the Sask Party, the truth is just 
whatever statement they made last. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 

Payouts 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday 
Leader-Post columnist Bob Hughes came up with an apropos 
moniker for the Premier of this province when he referred to the 
Premier as, quote, “Cheque Book Lorne.” And from the events 
we’ve seen so far this session, I’d say he hit the nail right on the 
head. 
 
Mr. Speaker, first there was the Murdoch Carriere scandal that 
saw the NDP [New Democratic Party] government pay a 
ridiculously handsome payout to the man at the centre of the 
scandal — the Murdoch Carriere golden handshake. Let me 
remind you, Mr. Speaker, that Murdoch Carriere is a former 
senior government bureaucrat that was fired for harassment and 
convicted of assault. He not only got a sizable payoff of 
$275,000 but he also received a very generous top-up of his 
government pension. 
 
Then we have the secretive situation surrounding former NDP 
caucus chief Jim Fodey, who tendered his resignation a few 
weeks ago. According to the rules of the Legislative Assembly, 
severance is not to be paid to caucus staff members who resign. 
Clearly the NDP have no respect for such rules, and as a result 
are handing out yet another Murdoch Carriere golden 
handshake — or is it hush money? — for one of their own that 
could cost the taxpayer $100,000 or more. 
 
As Bob Hughes put it, paraphrasing from Gomery who 
investigated the Liberal Ad Scam scandal, quote: 
 

. . . Cheque Book Lorne is ready to cut him a cheque for 
resigning. Nice work, if you can find it. Screw up, resign, 
and get paid for it. 

 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 

Criminal Sentences 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, in November of last year, police searched the home of 
Donald and Audrey Black in Moose Jaw. They found two 
computers, videos, CD-ROMs and still photographs. The 
material recorded an unspeakable evil series of sexual abuses 
against three little girls aged 5, 4, and 18 months. The judge in 
the case refused to read out the exact details. He had this to say: 
“They are so sickening that to read them would degrade me and 
be degrading to the listener to hear them.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday Audrey Black was sentenced for four 
years in prison on five separate charges. Mr. Speaker, I think 
Saskatchewan people today are upset with that particular 
sentence. I don’t think they believe that’s enough. 
 
My question is to the Premier: does he believe that that sentence 
is long enough for this particular unspeakably evil crime? And 



1560 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

if he doesn’t, Mr. Speaker, will he work with the federal 
government? Will he encourage them, Mr. Speaker, to pursue 
much stronger sentences for the country that would obviously 
benefit the people of the province as well? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, I hope that the Leader of 
the Opposition is not calling on the government to politicize the 
courts and the prosecutions. I know they’ve done this in the 
past, and I think they’ve regretted it. 
 
As to the question as to whether we work with the federal 
government to ensure that most dangerous offenders, the most 
violent offenders, the offenders who commit serious crimes 
receive appropriate sentences, yes we do, Mr. Speaker. And we 
work quite closely with the federal government in that respect, 
and we campaigned for that. 
 
Saskatchewan has aggressively sought dangerous offender 
applications and been successful. I think if you compare us 
across the country, very aggressive and very successful in 
comparison with other jurisdictions, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, as representatives of the people of 
this province, I think they expect us to ask questions and the 
government to answer questions related to justice — the justice 
system, to the length of sentences and to the kinds of sentences 
that we have, that the judiciary has available to them here in the 
country and in the province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Audrey Black’s husband was sentenced to eight 
years for seven counts. The mother of two of Black’s victims 
said this in February of this year: 
 

I still have all the images of what he did to my kids stuck 
in my mind and I haven’t even seen the pictures or the 
videos. It’s just stupid. He should have got more than eight 
years. 
 

Mr. Speaker, I agree with that mother. I think the people of the 
province also agree with that mother. The sentence seemed to 
be wrong. It seemed to be stupid. 
 
And so the question to the government, to the Premier is this: 
what is he doing now? What will he do in the future to lobby, to 
encourage the federal government to move on perhaps 
consecutive sentences, Mr. Speaker, or mandatory minimums? 
What’s his position? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, the Saskatchewan 
government has been very active in pursuing meaningful reform 
to dangerous offender legislation, meaningful reform to the 
processes of identifying high-risk offenders and making sure 
that jurisdictions are aware of the presence of high-risk 
offenders. 

The Saskatchewan government has been very, very aggressive 
in pursuing criminal justice reform so that the most high risk, 
the most dangerous, the most serious offenders are identified, 
that the communities are aware of their existence — particularly 
the police communities are aware of their existence — and that 
when they go to court, the courts are aware of who they are 
dealing with and that they are dealt with appropriately. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the minister and the 
government on the work that they have done with respect to 
dangerous offenders. These are other issues that we’re asking 
about today. We’re asking about sentencing. 
 
The Crown prosecutor in the case of Donald Black also 
expressed his dissatisfaction, Mr. Speaker. Rob Parker said the 
Crown sentence recommendation was based on previous court 
decisions. Here’s what he had to say, quote, “I wasn’t 
necessarily satisfied by the logic even that comes from our 
Court of Appeal.” That’s a very honest and courageous 
statement, I believe, by a Crown prosecutor who is frustrated 
with what’s available right now currently to the justice system. 
 
There are other options that we could be pursuing, that we 
could be lobbying the federal government on. I’ve written a 
letter to the minister of Justice — the then minister — in 
August ’06 in the wake of the Whitmore abduction. We’ve 
written another letter today to the current Minister of Justice. 
There’s some options to be pursued — consecutive sentences, 
mandatory minimums. 
 
What’s this government’s plan on this count? What is it doing 
to lobby the federal government for stronger sentences to 
protect children in the province of Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, I’m glad that we’re 
recognizing the role of the Crown prosecutor here. Crown 
prosecutors in Saskatchewan have done a very good job. 
They’re extraordinary public servants. They have done good 
work in appealing criminal sentences that should be appealed. 
They’ve had great success in the Court of Appeal in many 
cases. 
 
And the Court of Appeal over a number of years, I think, has 
established that Saskatchewan is not a short-sentence 
jurisdiction. And I need to defend the judges in this province, 
Mr. Speaker. That’s part of my job when they come under 
attack. Their independence has to be respected. I don’t think it’s 
helpful to refer to their decisions, if you weren’t sitting in the 
court during the trial, as stupid. I don’t think that’s helpful. I 
don’t think that should be done, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Government of Saskatchewan has campaigned for effective 
changes to dangerous offender legislation which I am quite 
willing to outline to the House, Mr. Speaker, if there’s another 



May 9, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1561 

question. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, the judge in this case quite rightly 
had this to say, quote, “In reality, words are inadequate in 
confronting the enormity of the degradation inflicted on three 
tiny and helpless girls.” I remind the House, five years, four 
years old, and 18 months. The quote goes on: “The terrible 
consequences upon their future psychological and sexual 
development are obvious and it demands denunciation in the 
strongest terms that the law allows.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, I think the judge is absolutely right. And we are 
asking questions today about whether this minister agrees that 
sentences should be tougher for these kinds of crimes, whether 
or not the federal government should be encouraged to pursue 
consecutive sentences and mandatory minimums. Does the 
minister agree with that? And if he does, will he join with the 
party, with the letter that we’ve sent today, in encouraging the 
federal government to move in this direction? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, the Government of 
Saskatchewan has been and is, I think, currently the leader in 
campaigning for more effective dangerous offender legislation, 
in particular: to clarify the onus and eligibility criteria for 
dangerous offenders in the Criminal Code and make the breach 
of a long-term offender order grounds for a dangerous offender 
application, to double the current 12-months limit for 
recognizance order for high-risk offenders, to provide more 
resources for the national flagging system so as to better alert 
prosecutors in the histories of high-risk offenders in other 
jurisdictions. 
 
Prime Minister Harper promised to do the latter; he has yet to 
deliver on that. For some reason, the federal government has 
declined to move on any of those except to double the current 
12-month limit for recognizance order for high-risk offenders. 
We continue to press the federal government for meaningful 
reform to dangerous offender legislation, Mr. Speaker.

Prince Albert Pulp Mill 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
today is a very sad day for the people of Prince Albert and the 
surrounding communities. This morning we heard, we learned 
that the P.A. [Prince Albert] pulp mill will not reopen. We 
could have guessed that in March that when the minister gave 
this project the kiss of death, announcing that the deal has been 
reached with Domtar. Mr. Speaker, what does the minister have 
to say to the hundreds of families in Prince Albert and area who 
depend on this mill? 
 

[14:15] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister 
Responsible for the Forestry Secretariat. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
member for the question. This morning in Prince Albert I did 
hold a press conference in which I outlined four points with 
respect to updating the people of Prince Albert, the people of 
Saskatchewan as to the process Domtar has been involved in. 
 
I indicated firstly that we had worked with Domtar to put 
forward a comprehensive business plan that they saw fit not to 
move forward with. I indicated as well that discussions with 
Domtar are continuing, and I did indicate as well that the 
timelines would make the prospects for opening the Prince 
Albert pulp mill this fall very remote. I also indicated that we 
are proceeding with a process to seek expressions of interest for 
the use of wood supply should the Domtar facilities remain 
closed until April ’08 and the wood becomes available for 
reallocation. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosthern-Shellbrook. 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, obviously the 417,000 taxpayer dollars paid NDP 
buddy Tom Waller to save the mill hasn’t panned out. And this 
minister has failed to do what he said he would do. And, Mr. 
Speaker, we all know well the track record this minister has. 
 
The NDP is now back to square one. What happens now with 
communities like Big River who supply wood chips to the P.A. 
mill? What happens to the many spinoff businesses that will be 
reeling from this closure? 
 
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about reopening the facility. 
What is the NDP’s plan B now that Domtar is out? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for the 
Forestry Secretariat. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, we’re not entering 
plan B. We’re still on plan A. And plan A is to work with the 
owners of these assets to establish a operational facility and that 
remains the plan. Mr. Speaker, this is not a process that has 
been completed. 
 
I want to remind members opposite that there is in that forest 
management agreement a two-year dormancy clause that was 
negotiated many years ago when their leader was running 
around delivering free whisky to the guys who made that 
decision, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I want to say that we’re still continuing to work with Domtar. 
We will be moving this forward. And, Mr. Speaker, if this is a 
horse race, it’s not over. We’ve got a ways to go. There are 
people who want those assets, and we’re going to ensure that 
we have these facilities up and operational as soon as we can. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 



1562 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

The Speaker: — Order please. Order please. I would ask all 
members to stay away from making remarks that have personal 
reflections upon other members of the Assembly. And I would 
ask the member, or the minister to withdraw a statement with 
respect to the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I withdraw that 
statement. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosthern-Shellbrook. 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Well, Mr. Speaker, the people of 
Saskatchewan know all too well about this minister with the 
$35 million SPUDCO [Saskatchewan Potato Utility 
Development Company] deal. It wasn’t long ago the minister 
was in Prince Albert bragging to a room full of people, there 
was a deal. There is no deal, and there’s no answers coming 
from this minister. Rhetoric does not provide jobs to the people 
of Prince Albert. In the government’s press release this 
morning, the minister is quoted saying, and I quote, “. . . we 
remain committed to our original objectives of reopened 
facilities and sustainable use of the Crown wood supply.” 

 
Mr. Speaker, when is this minister reopening the Prince Albert 
mill, and what company is going to do it? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for the 
Forestry Secretariat. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, that shows how little 
this individual understands about the issue. The first thing is, it 
will not be the province of Saskatchewan, the Government of 
Saskatchewan, or any individual MLA [Member of Legislative 
Assembly] or cabinet minister who opens the mill. We don’t 
own those assets. 
 
There were owned by Weyerhaeuser. A merger took place. 
They’re now owned by a company called Domtar. Domtar will 
make the decision with respect to whether or not they sell the 
mill, whether or not they run the mill. That’s their decision to 
make. 
 
Our role is to do this. Our role is to do what we can as the 
province of Saskatchewan to facilitate the opening of that mill 
under whichever corporate structure may surface. Our 
responsibility also is, when the dormant period ends and they 
are totally in breach of forest management agreement in April 
2008, that we are prepared to have done everything that we 
could so that we can establish operations in that forest licensed 
agreement and in that forest management area. That’s exactly 
what we’ll continue to do. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Humboldt. 
 

Caucus Personnel and Police Documents 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, it’s now been almost two 
weeks since the NDP chief of staff, Jim Fodey resigned over his 
role in the NDP fraud scandal, and the Premier still refuses to 

answer a pretty basic question. Why is Jim Fodey getting 
severance if he resigned? Mr. Speaker, the rules of the 
Legislative Assembly clearly state that severance is only 
payable to caucus employees who are dismissed without cause. 
 
I voted for that rule, and the members opposite voted for that 
rule. Why did we pass the severance package if the Premier is 
just going to ignore it? 
 
Mr. Speaker, I hope the Premier has the courage to stand up and 
answer the question. Why is the NDP giving Jim Fodey the 
Murdoch Carriere golden handshake if he resigned? 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. I would wish to advise the 
Assembly that the question is out of order. However I will 
allow a response if it is volunteered. The Chair recognizes the 
Minister for the Public Service Commission. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
just want to say to all members of the legislature that the rules 
as established by the Board of Internal Economy will be 
followed in this case. 
 
But I do want to talk about what I describe as a very interesting 
scrum that took place by the Leader of the Saskatchewan Party 
yesterday out in the rotunda. Mr. Speaker, it was interesting, 
and if you . . . It was a very lengthy scrum, but what I 
concluded is this, that the Leader of the Saskatchewan Party 
wants to pretend to take the moral high ground by professing in 
a scrum that he’s actually had the stolen documents from the 
police for over a year, Mr. Speaker, and he professes that this is 
— and I quote — honesty. 
 
But you know that’s simply not credible, and it’s not credible 
because he’s had over one year to manufacture, along with his 
operatives, the spin, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the police came 
calling, and he wanted to correct the public record because the 
police were going to correct . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Member’s time has elapsed. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And in trying to 
evade an answer to my question, I’m glad that the minister 
outlined what happened yesterday because she outlined the big 
difference between the Saskatchewan Party leader and the 
so-called NDP leader. Our leader did go out into that rotunda 
. . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order please. The member for 
Humboldt. 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And as the 
minister pointed out, our leader did indeed go out into that 
rotunda yesterday, and he answered all the reporters’ questions 
about his actions. And the NDP leader refuses to do that until he 
finally gets cornered. And then he’ll say that he doesn’t 
remember or that he’s not responsible for what happened. 
 



May 9, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1563 

Mr. Speaker, I think the Premier does remember the NDP fraud 
cover-up, and he is responsible of whether or not Jim Fodey 
gets a severance. Mr. Speaker, once again . . . I’ll ask the 
question once again. Why is Jim Fodey getting the Murdoch 
Carriere golden handshake, and why is Jim Fodey getting 
severance if he resigned? 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Order. The Chair recognizes the 
Minister for the Public Service Commission. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Let’s review the facts. Two weeks ago 
today the Deputy Leader of the Saskatchewan Party goes out 
into the rotunda and says that they had these stolen documents 
since the beginning of session, Mr. Speaker. And then the 
caucus critic, the Justice critic, he goes out and says it. Then the 
deputy leader goes out again . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order. Order. Minister for the 
Public Service Commission. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — So we’ve got two members of the 
opposition going out and saying they’ve had these documents, 
these stolen documents, since the beginning of the session. And 
the Leader of the Opposition sits right beside the deputy leader, 
and, Mr. Speaker, he goes out into the rotunda and tries to 
create a different spin, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And you know why? Because one member of their caucus has 
been interviewed by the police, and one of their staff members 
have been interviewed by the police. And, Mr. Speaker, let’s 
hope they tell the police the truth. And they had to come clean, 
Mr. Speaker. That’s why the diatribe out there yesterday 
afternoon by the Sask Party. 
 
The Speaker: — Member’s time has elapsed.

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for

Four Directions Group Home 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the media reported that the minister decided to shut 
down the Four Directions group home only after the Children’s 
Advocate threatened to go public with problems at the facility. 
The minister tried to justify this by saying, and I quote, “Let me 
be absolutely clear. The children were not at immediate risk.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, a report tabled by the minister yesterday tells a 
very different story. On page 35 of that report it says that Four 
Directions centre failed to meet 10 of 35 standards in the area of 
safety. The report says these unmet safety standards, and I 
quote, “pose potentially serious safety issues for the residents.” 
 
In light of this clear language from his own report, why is the 
minister still telling the people that the children at this facility 
were not at risk? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister for 
Community Services. 
 

Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, I’ll point out that my 
officials have been involved at Four D for at least twice as long 
as the child’s advocate. They have been certainly working with 
the Four D board of directors for two years. And, Mr. Speaker, 
they identified some of the problems initially on the actual 
facility, and then of course they expanded their investigation, if 
you will, onto some other areas which include the lack of 
recreational programming, the lack of an education program, 
and so on and so forth, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Our department worked very closely with Four D, and after a 
year, we looked at other issues that needed to be addressed. And 
yes, despite the fact that we were patient, at the end of the day, 
we felt we were patient long enough, and I made the decision as 
the minister to shut down the facility till all these issues had 
been resolved. And it will not reopen until they all have been 
settled, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Well, Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the 
rotunda, he said that the children were not at risk. His own 
report says that, and he won’t answer the question. He wants to 
talk around it. 
 
Let me quote from page 31 of the report tabled by the minister 
yesterday. It says about Four Directions: 
 

Some of the bedrooms do not comply with The Residential 
Services Act . . . 
 
Fire exits . . . [are] blocked. 
 
The new bedroom doors are incorrectly installed, and open 
inward rather than outward. This has created the problem 
of children barricading themselves into their rooms by 
moving . . . furniture up against the door and preventing 
staff from entering . . . 

 
Mr. Speaker, has the minister even read this report? And if he’s 
read this report, how can he say that children were not at risk 
when it’s obvious to everyone else in this province that they 
were? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister for 
Community Services. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, let me point out for the 
record that I have read the entire document, Mr. Speaker. And I 
take my role very seriously as somebody that’s going to help 
the First Nations establish the capacity to finally have the 
services and the proper facilities on reserve. They have that 
right, Mr. Speaker. And all we get from the opposition, Mr. 
Speaker, is doom and gloom and negative things about First 
Nations finally trying to assert themselves to have a right to 
determine their future and their First Nations children’s future 
as best they can. 
 
This government will continue working hard. This minister will 
continue working through problems and providing solutions, 



1564 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

and we will provide leadership, Mr. Speaker. This is very 
important we begin to address the problems that many First 
Nation people have said have existed for years. 
 
We are going to continue pressing the federal government. 
We’re going to continue involving the First Nations. And the 
last place that we’re going to look for advice from, Mr. 
Speaker, is from that member and that party opposite, because 
they have nothing but negative things to say about First Nations 
people, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Saskatoon 
Northwest. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. What the minister 
forgets to realize, this isn’t an issue about Aboriginal children 
— a child is a child is a child. A child under his protection is his 
duty to protect them, regardless of where they’re from, and he’s 
not doing it. 
 
On page 12 of the report states that staff at the facility had not 
received non-violence crisis intervention training. The staff was 
not able to describe when physical intervention or restraints 
were permitted. The treatment these children received may have 
caused more problems. 
 
[14:30] 
 
On page 13 of the report states that “. . . too many children with 
no histories of criminal offences were coming out of the 
program with a criminal record.” What a statement. This place 
was making kids worse than better. Once again, given this 
report, how can the minister claim that these children were not 
in immediate danger? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — Mr. Speaker, once again the member 
says, okay a child is a child is a child, and I absolutely, totally 
agree. Everybody in Saskatchewan agrees. It should not be 
based on where that child is from. 
 
So perhaps that member should get a hold of his federal cousins 
and tell them to start anteing up some of the resources needed 
for First Nations Child and Family Services, which they have 
ignored for years, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Belanger: — And every time, Mr. Speaker, every 
time there’s some negative publicity, that member and that 
party jumps up at the opportunity to play politics. And I say to 
you, get on to your federal cousins and tell them to start finally 
resourcing the First Nations people to an adequate, respectful 
level, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And that’s a fine party to talk, Mr. Speaker, because that very 
leader, the ex-leader, and that party promised to cut $50 million 
from the Social Services budget last election. How would that 
help the people at risk here, Mr. Speaker? How would that 
help? Thank you very much. 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

TABLING OF DOCUMENTS 
 
The Speaker: — Before orders of the day, I wish to table a 
letter received from the Saskatchewan Information and Privacy 
Commissioner. The letter is dated May 9, 2007, with respect to 
The Vital Statistics Act, 2007.

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 53 
 

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Nilson that Bill No. 53 — The 
Miscellaneous Environment Statutes (Inspections and 
Investigations) Amendment Act, 2007 be now read a second 
time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Martensville. 
 
Ms. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to rise 
today to speak to Bill 53. Among other things this Bill offers 
additional powers to and for conservation officers — powers to 
inspect. And it also standardizes terms that would constitute 
obstruction in the course of the conservation officers doing his 
or her job. We think this is important so that everybody 
involved knows what the rules and regulations are . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. Member for Martensville. 
 
Ms. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This Bill is 
basically a housekeeping Bill that standardizes terminology in 
other Bills, which will help clarify the rules and obligations for 
both conservation officers and residents. Mr. Speaker, if we 
have further questions on this, we will take those to committee. 
And therefore I move this Bill to committee. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion proposed by the Minister of the Environment that Bill 
No. 53, The Miscellaneous Environment Statutes (Inspections 
and Investigations) Amendment Act, 2007 be now a read a 
second time. Is the Assembly ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel: — Second reading of 
this Bill. 
 



May 9, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1565 

The Speaker: — To which committee shall this Bill be 
referred? The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 53, The 
Miscellaneous Environment Statutes (Inspections and 
Investigations) Amendment Act, 2007 be referred to the 
Standing Committee on Economy. 

 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Minister of the 
Environment that Bill No. 53 be referred to the Standing 
Committee on the Economy. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly 
to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. For what honourable 
purpose is the member from Saskatoon Nutana on her feet? 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — I’d ask for leave to introduce a guest, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The member has requested leave for 
introductions. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Nutana. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, it gives me a great deal of 
pleasure to introduce a guest in the west gallery. It’s not often 
that we get visitors from my home constituency of Saskatoon 
Nutana. I’d like to welcome Louise Buhler who lives in 
Saskatoon Nutana but also happens to live right across the street 
from me. 
 
I know that Louise is probably here for SCIC [Saskatchewan 
Council for International Cooperation], and she is an active 
member in the city of Saskatoon on all kinds of international 
issues but also welcoming people from across the globe that 
come to our province and our city as refugees or newcomers. 
And she’s been actively involved with the Global Gathering 
Place. 
 
Louise spent 20 years in Vietnam and has been honoured by the 
Vietnamese government for all of the work that she did with 
people in Vietnam. She and her husband Jake have returned to 
Saskatchewan a few years ago. They’re making their home 
here. And I’m so pleased to see her in the legislative gallery, 
and I would ask all members of the legislature to welcome 
Louise Buhler to the legislature. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. For what purpose does the 
member from Saskatoon Greystone wish to be recognized? 
 
Mr. Prebble: — For leave to introduce guests, Mr. Speaker. 

The Speaker: — The member for Greystone has requested 
leave for introductions. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. The member for 
Greystone. 
 
Mr. Prebble: — Well thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It’s 
my pleasure to introduce a visitor in the Speaker’s gallery. 
Louise Buhler’s husband, Jake Buhler, has also joined us, Mr. 
Speaker, and I’ve had the great pleasure of being friends of the 
Buhlers for many, many years. 
 
He also of course has served for 20 years in Vietnam but he has 
also served in Saskatchewan in so many different capacities. 
And one of the ones that is important to me, Mr. Speaker, is that 
Jake Buhler has done so much important work in this province 
in terms of helping people understand how to reduce their 
ecological footprint on this planet. He has been very involved in 
the environmental movement and the anti-nuclear movement. 
He played a very important role in the work in the 1970s to 
prevent a uranium refinery from being built in his home 
community of Warman. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’m very pleased to have Mr. Buhler and Louise 
Buhler as friends and I want to warmly welcome Jake to this 
Assembly. Thank you very much. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the hon. member on his feet? The 
member for Rosthern-Shellbrook. 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — With leave to introduce guests, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The member for Rosthern-Shellbrook has 
requested leave for introductions. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosthern-Shellbrook. 
 
Mr. Allchurch: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. Through you 
and to you, to all members of the Assembly, seated in the 
gallery today, who just walked in, is a group of grade 4 
students. There is 38 students and they’re from Shellbrook 
Elementary School in Shellbrook. And it’s a pleasure to see 
them here today because it’s a long way from Shellbrook down 
to Regina. I drive that every Sunday afternoon, and I know. It’s 
nice to see them here. 
 
With them is teachers, Denise McDonald, Emelia Schiller, and 
Karen Spencer. Along with them, Mr. Speaker, is 14 
chaperones. I do not have the names of them but it’s nice to see 
the chaperones, teachers, and the students from Shellbrook here 
today. And I would ask all members of the Assembly to 
welcome them to their Legislative Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 



1566 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

The Speaker: — For what purpose is the member from 
Saskatchewan Rivers wish to be recognized? 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — To introduce guests, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Request for introductions. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatchewan Rivers. 
 
Mr. Borgerson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to join 
with the member from Rosthern-Shellbrook in welcoming the 
students here from Shellbrook Elementary School. A few of 
those students — I would think six or seven or eight of those 
students — are from my constituency of Saskatchewan Rivers, 
from communities like Sturgeon River and Holbein, I believe. 
I’d like to also welcome their teacher, Emelia Schiller, who 
lives in my constituency of Saskatchewan Rivers. 
 
They are here today to participate in Saskatchewan Council of 
International Cooperation International Information Day which 
is going to be held just down the hallway here in the legislature. 
So I too would like to ask members to join me in welcoming 
everyone here from Shellbrook area. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Quennell that Bill No. 37 — The 
Court of Appeal Amendment Act, 2006/Loi de 2006 
modifiant la Loi de 2000 sur la Cour d’appel be now read a

Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s a pleasure to 
speak on Bill No. 37, An Act to amend The Court of Appeal 
Act, 2000. Mr. Speaker, the Bill is very simple. What the 
government is asking is to reduce the nine-member Court of 
Appeal down to seven judges. 
 
Now the reasons around why that is necessary or why that is 
happening, that’s certainly open for debate. I understand the 
reason is that there is not enough work for the nine judges so 
they’re suggesting that the Court of Appeal be reduced to seven 
as vacancies occur. 
 
It’s interesting that this is happening when our population is 
also dropping in this province. The Justice critic has said that 
there seems to be a higher . . . there’s a backlog of cases that are 
civil and criminal. So it’s interesting to note that they’re 
reducing the court of appeals, Mr. Speaker. But I think this 
speaks to the government’s history, the government’s policies 
in the past. as does the population of this province is becoming 
reduced, dropping well below 1 million people. Now we see 

that the effects of a reduced population in this Bill, when the 
government’s suggesting to reduce the number of judges on the 
Court of Appeal from nine to seven. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I mean, does this speak to the economic policies 
of the NDP government over the last 16 years? Well I believe it 
does. As more and more people leave this province, or the 
youth of this province leave this province to go elsewhere for 
jobs, families go elsewhere to look for jobs, this certainly 
translates into a reduced need for certain services in the 
province. Instead of having a growing population in this 
province where we would need to increase services in the 
province, we’re just seeing the opposite effect. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, one of the things that we have noticed about 
this Bill, and a number of people say, that the government did 
not consult very widely about the need to reduce the number of 
Court of Appeal justices. And we feel that every Bill that the 
government introduce, they should take the effort to consult 
with not only the members of the judicial, but also the people in 
Saskatchewan and the obvious stakeholders that need to be 
spoken to about making this type of a change. 
 
And again, we go back again, this seems . . . the evidence 
suggests that there’s a backlog of cases in the court system 
concerning especially the civil and criminal areas. So there’s a 
lot of interesting information out there that contradicts the need 
of the government to reduce the Court of Appeal. 
 
But what we would like to do, Mr. Speaker, is let this Bill go to 
committee and . . . where we will question the government on 
the need for this change and ask questions that should have 
been asked to the stakeholders in the province before 
introducing this Bill. So, Mr. Speaker, I’d like to end my 
comments by letting this go to committee.

Bill No. 43 

 
[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Quennell that Bill No. 43 — The 
Payday Loans Act be now read a second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s my 
duty and privilege to speak today to Bill No. 43, An Act 
respecting Payday Loan Agreements, Payday Lenders and 
Borrowers. And, Mr. Speaker, this Bill has been before the 
House for a number of weeks now and has had the opportunity 
of some airing by members of the official opposition. I think 
several of my colleagues have risen in the House to address this 
particular piece of legislation and some of the issues that 
surround it. 
 
I don’t think that there is a lot more that I might add today, Mr. 
Speaker, except to restate once again what this particular piece 
of legislation is, the segment of our economy that this 
legislation will address, and some of the issues that will arise 
out of the introduction of this particular Bill. 
 
As you will know, Mr. Speaker, payday loans are short-term 
loans. They’re not uncommon in our world. These short-term 
loans usually have to be paid back in a very abbreviated time 
frame, usually upon receipt of the customer’s next paycheque. 
And these short-term loans are also accompanied by a 
significantly higher interest rate and service fees than one might 
ordinarily assume. 
 
The Payday Loans Act will include provisions as a result of the 
legislation that require licensing of payday lenders. They will 
set maximum limits on the cost of payday loans and the type of 
fees that can be charged. And security on loans, they’ll be 
prevented. Security on loans will be prevented by the lenders. 
The legislation also will prevent lenders from requiring the 
borrower to sign over future wages or to purchase another 
product or service before the first loan is paid off. So there are 
some pretty good provisions to protect consumers and users of 
payday loans in this legislation. 
 
I think it’s important to note that one of the provisions here that 
has been problematic for the industry and people who have 
looked at the industry from the outside was the issue of multiple 
loans at any given time, and this legislation will protect 
borrowers to the extent that there will only be one loan allowed 
at a time. 
 
Now lenders will also be required to comply with collection 

practices as set out in The Collection Agents Act, and 
apparently a maximum fee of $20 for every $100 borrowed will 
be established. Now those look like they’re pretty 
straightforward provisions, Mr. Speaker, and I think that, as a 
whole, the industry has been looking for some kind of 
regulation under which the industry can operate so as to be 
protected from charges of usury. 
 
The Payday Loan Association has been very concerned about 
the activities of some companies operating in this field and felt 
that legislation would be an appropriate measure. In fact I 
noticed when I was reading through the paper a couple of days 
ago that the president of the association in Canada was quite 
concerned that this particular piece of legislation wasn’t going 
to pass. I don’t think there was any ever doubt about this 
legislation moving through the House in an appropriate and 
timely manner, and I don’t think the fears of the association 
president were well founded. 
 
But nevertheless, I think as a representative of the official 
opposition, just because we want to see this legislation move 
forward doesn’t mean that there aren’t problems or difficulties 
with the particular piece of legislation. The fact of that is borne 
out by communications that, I believe, the Justice minister and 
our Justice critic have received from one of the companies in 
this province that provides these types of services. And what the 
concern revolves around particularly is that the province will 
proceed with setting rates on an arbitrary basis. 
 
I think the industry wants an opportunity to have their industry 
regulated appropriately. But as is so often the case, Mr. 
Speaker, the details are unknown to the people who are going to 
be impacted by the legislation until such time as the regulations 
are written and provided for public review. And the concern of 
these particular companies is that regulation, unknownst to 
them until a later date, might prevent them from operating in a 
transparent and well-informed manner. So it’s difficult for 
companies to agree to legislation if they don’t know what the 
details might be and the details won’t come until the regulation 
is announced. 
 
This particular letter says that: 
 

In our discussions with officials of the ministry to this 
point, we have been provided with no information 
regarding the rate development process or no assurances 
that the province’s objective is to achieve a competitive 
outcome. 

 
And, Mr. Speaker, I think the concern that is being enunciated 
in this particular letter ought to be of concern to the government 
as well because regulating the industry is one thing. But making 
sure that the law as it’s written and the regulations as provided 
as follow-up to the legislation provide for a competitive 
environment and an environment that is completely transparent 
. . . that all participants and all players will be able to see and 
understand. And that is not the case at this point. 
 
And so, Mr. Speaker, we have raised this particular concern. I 
think that we will want to raise it again as it regards this piece 
of legislation. We will want to ask the minister what he intends 
to put in the regulations. I think if there’s nothing to hide, the 
minister shouldn’t be afraid of providing that information. But 



1568 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

on that understanding, Mr. Speaker, I would move that this 
particular Bill go to committee.

motion proposed by the Minister of Justice that Bill No. 43, The 
Payday Loans Act be now read a second time. Is the Assembly

Bill No. 46 
 
[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Cline that Bill No. 46 — The Crown 
Minerals Amendment Act, 2007 be now read a second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Lloydminster. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to 
add one or two comments for the record on this particular Bill. 
It is involved of course The Crown Minerals Act and very much 
involved with the mineral rights associated with land. And in 
particular my area, the minerals and the mineral rights become a 
very important issue. And I wanted to put on the record one or 
two of the things that I believe should be on the record, and 
then I’m prepared to move this to committee. 
 
But before I do that, Mr. Speaker, this an interesting Act 
because, although it’s housekeeping in nature, it’s trying to 
streamline the language, streamline the whole tax and royalty 
assessment on the different divisions and different categories of 
ownership of the minerals, whether it’s freehold or Crown. And 
there was a category called Crown-acquired production that I 
think deserves a particular comment. 

I do recognize the fact that in the oil business and the oil 
industry that regulations and taxes have been streamlined. And 
that is a good thing because we want to keep our assessments 
and royalties and taxes if not in line, at least competitive and 
going in the right direction with the competitors that we have. 
And obviously in my area the competitors are very close to the 
Saskatchewan side. 
 
But one of the things that has come to mind, as in any 
endeavour, you have to be able to attract investors into this 
business. It’s a very high-risk industry. And to attract investors, 
there has to be a certain level of transparency, certainly a 
predictability, and also accountability without changing the 
rules partway through the business venture that you’re in. 
Without that confidence that has to be built within the investors, 
investors just will not come. 
 
It is still interesting to note that in my particular area, 
comparing the Saskatchewan side investment in the drilling of 
both oil and gas, we are still behind the rate of drilling on the 
Alberta side by a factor of about 1:5. And there is therefore still 
a distance to go to build that confidence of the investor, in 
particular in this case, in the oil industry. 
 
Generally speaking, as in any investment that creates jobs and 
therefore creates wealth, the risk has to be and is recognized as 
commensurate with the return. And even though the taxes and 
royalties and regulations have been streamlined, it is still 
interesting to note that there is still that discrepancy. Why it’s 
performing so well is maybe not so much to do with the 
royalties and the competitive nature with our competitors, but 
maybe something to do with $60 and more a barrel for oil has 
changed that ratio of risk to compensation to allow a lot more 
drilling and production to go on on the Saskatchewan side. 
 
But just let me add another thought here. It refers to, in these 
amendments to this Act, the time in the 1969, ’70, ’71 era. And 
I remember that era in the oil industry when there was a new 
company that showed up into our area and then across the 
province called SaskOil. And I didn’t realize at the time 
because I wasn’t involved in that industry, but SaskOil was 
created on the basis of wells that were being abandoned because 
the royalty assessments on wells were placed at such a high 
level that there was no return on investment. And in fact there 
was penalties introduced at that time as well. 
 
A lot of the people that had money involved in investment in 
those oil rights and in trying to develop those rights had to in 
fact walk away from it. And a lot of them ended up into a 
bankruptcy or near bankruptcy and in fact couldn’t believe what 
was happening and moved out of the province, never to return. 
 
SaskOil became an entity, and thus the category of 
Crown-acquired production, as it’s termed in these 
amendments. And so now we’re trying to streamline the 
categories from the three — Crown royalties, freehold, and 
Crown acquired — trying to streamline that back into two, just 
Crown royalties and freehold. 
 
But these people remember well. And if we want to get 
reinvestment into our industry, we have to make sure that there 
is a competence level that we can build with these people. And 
once we do that — and I think we will do that with a change in 



May 9, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1569 

government primarily — these people have committed that the 
economy will grow as quickly with investment into the oil 
industry as any other industry, including agriculture, in our 
province. So these people once bitten are twice shy, and we 
have a ways to go yet to build that confidence level. 
 
I think there’s a lot of questions that need to be still asked with 
regards to this Bill and associated questions as to why this was 
needed in the first place. And I’m prepared at this time to 
recommend this Bill go to committee. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion proposed by the Minister of Industry and Resources that 
that Bill No. 46, The Crown Minerals Amendment Act, 2007 be 
now read a second time. Is the Assembly ready for the 
question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
[15:00] 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel: — Second reading of

Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Mr. Speaker, I move that Bill No. 46, The 
Crown Minerals Amendment Act, 2007 be referred to the 
Standing Committee on the Economy. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Government House 
Leader that Bill No. 46 be referred to the Standing Committee

motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. This Bill No. 46 stands

Bill No. 48 
 
[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Cline that Bill No. 48 — The Freehold 
Oil and Gas Production Tax Amendment Act, 2007 be now 
read a second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Lloydminster. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wanted to 
address this particular Act with similar comments that I made 
on the . . . my comments or remarks earlier. In fact this one 
really becomes more of a housekeeping issue where the 
definition of Crown-acquired land is trying to . . . has to be 

redefined in the Act so that the royalties and tax structure 
becomes more streamlined with either the Crown royalties or 
freehold lands. Those are the two divisions, and they want to 
apparently reduce the third division — Crown-acquired. 
 
And again I don’t want to repeat what I said earlier, but it was 
Crown-acquired lands seem to flow back to the late 1960s, early 
1970s when there was quite a change in the ownership of a lot 
of the mineral rights. Also there was a lot of people, a lot of 
investors in oil producing companies that lost confidence in 
what was happening in Saskatchewan and subsequently moved 
to Alberta. In fact there’s a lot of the companies — I would 
venture a majority of the companies — operating in Alberta are 
Saskatchewan-based originally and have moved, lost 
confidence over the time. 
 
I think, as I mentioned earlier, I think the direction is going 
correctly with streamlining some of the regulations, making the 
royalties and taxes more reasonable. But in consultation with oil 
companies operating in Alberta, they will tell you — and freely 
tell you — that the royalty rates are not as big an issue as we 
may make them out to be. It is the regulation and the 
transparency of the regulation that is more critical. 
 
They will make a business plan on the basis of what is 
presented to them. And if you change and alter some of the 
factors in the agreements and the contracts, the confidence goes 
right out the window. We have to make sure that when we tell 
these oil companies that we’re making these changes for the 
right reasons, we have to make sure that for long-term 
investment the confidence of those investors are still there. 
 
Some of these things again will be brought up, I’m sure, under 
question in the committee. And I would propose, Mr. Speaker, 
that Bill 48 now proceed to committee. 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion proposed by the Minister of Industry and Resources that

Mr. Bjornerud: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate having the opportunity to speak to The Agricultural 
Societies Repeal Act, although it’s very straightforward and I 
think something that needed to be done, Mr. Speaker. We also 
understand that SAASE [Saskatchewan Association of 
Agricultural Societies and Exhibitions] was part of the changes 
that are in this repealing of the Act. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we also know that the original Bill actually came 
into being before Saskatchewan was even a province. So I think 
the last changes were made away back in 1976, Mr. Speaker. 
 
So we will have a few questions in committee, Mr. Speaker. 
But at this time we would want to move this Bill on to 
committee.

Ms. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to be 
able to rise today to speak on Bill No. 52, the Act to amend The 
Wildlife Act. As you know, Mr. Speaker, I come from a family 
of hunters, and growing up in that environment it’s a bit 
obvious to me that the people who use the land understand the 
necessity of ensuring the proper use of that land to make sure 
that our natural resources are protected. And I see by this Bill 
that wildlife officers are going to be given powers to search, 
power for seizure, investigation, those sorts of things. And I 
think it’s important that our conservation officers have the tools 
that they need to ensure that our wildlife is protected. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, I’m sure we might have a few more 
questions about this Bill, but at this time I would like to send 
this Bill to committee.

Bill No. 63 
 

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Hagel that Bill No. 63 — The Royal 
Saskatchewan Museum Act be now read a second time.] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Mr. Speaker, I’m very pleased to rise today to 
speak on Bill No. 63, The Royal Saskatchewan Museum Act. 
Saskatchewan is 100 years old, and I believe it is more than 
time that the museum finally had its own Act. I understand that 
the royal museum has not received the attention it deserves if 
we as citizens really care about preserving our history and our 
artifacts. The present museum is bulging at the seams. It 
literally has hundreds and hundreds of boxes of artifacts, and 
those artifacts are our history. They define who we are. 
 
I believe there’s a need for a computer linkage to the warehouse 
to keep track of historical possessions. I believe that there is 
need for money to ensure that there is the people to work with 
the artifacts that we have. There’s been cuts in the museum, in 
the budget to the museum since 1980. And the number of 
professional archaeologists we have has decreased in the last 
number of years. I really look forward to learning more about 
the workings and the responsibilities of the museum and of the 
staff. 
 
The lab space that is needed to work on the rare books that we 
have in Saskatchewan, that we should all be very proud of, is 
very limited and it is critical that we have that kind of space and 
the technicians to work with the artifacts if we indeed are going 
to have them around for our children and our grandchildren. We 
have to be proud of our history. 
 
Responsibility for museums has been moved around from one 
government department to another for the past number of years. 
And I do hope with the establishment of The Royal 
Saskatchewan Museum Act, the importance of museums will 
become a priority of any government. 
 
I’m especially pleased to see, Mr. Speaker, that this Act 
acknowledges the extreme importance of, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, the extreme importance of our First Nations, not only 
in our future, but in defining who we are based on where we 
came from. I am sure that many of us know that Treaty 4 
specifically describes a keeping house for First Nations artifacts 
that’s important when we come to talking about the treaty rights 
of our First Nation people, that we have a responsibility to 
ensure that their history is there for the generations to come — 
not only First Nations people, but for all of us. 
 
I hear many of the First Nations elders speaking of a . . . 
[inaudible] . . . of sacred and culturally sensitive artifacts, and I 
know that when Vice-chief Lyle Whitefish talked about this and 
when the Act was introduced, he was especially pleased to see 
that the history of the Saskatchewan First Nations would be 
included for all to see in the future. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, there will be questions that we have to 
ask on this Bill and the importance of seeing that the 
government really is, that they really do recognize the 

importance of our museums — not only for our First Nations, 
but for all Saskatchewan people. And I look forward to talking 
about this in committee, so I will move this Bill into committee 
at this time. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is 
a motion by the Minister of Culture, Youth and Recreation that 
Bill No. 63, The Royal Saskatchewan Museum Act be now read 
a second time. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed.

[The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Hagel that Bill No. 68 — The Status of 
the Artist Act, 2007 be now read a second time.] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, it’s my pleasure to enter into this debate this 
afternoon regarding The Status of the Artist Act and raise a 
number of issues in regards to this piece of legislation as it was 
presented first of all to the Human Services Committee. And the 
committee was asked to review a number of suggestions and come 
forward with some suggestions in regards to artists in the 
province. And the Bill at that time, which was Bill No. 40, which 
was a fairly simple and straightforward Bill although it did have a 
major component in it that some of the committee members, 
myself included, had some difficulties with. 
 
Subsequently, Madam Deputy Speaker, a request was made of the 
minister asking the minister exactly what the minister was looking 
for. And I guess part of the question that was placed to the 
minister was this whole process of the changes that have been 
made in the Assembly and how committees work and how 
committees would go about responding to requests from a 
minister, and in this case the minister responsible for the Bill 



1572 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

regarding the status of the artist as the minister was trying to look 
at whether or not committee work could take place and 
participation of the many interested parties in the formation of a 
piece of legislation. 
 
Many of us on the committee, Madam Deputy Speaker, have been 
around for a number of years and we’re more, if you will, used to 
the process whereby a piece of legislation is laid on the Table. We 
get a sense of where the minister and the department is coming 
from in regards to legislation, and then we start talking to 
individuals or groups who would be impacted by that legislation. 
And in the process of debate we move into a committee structure 
where you go through a piece of legislation item by item, clause 
by clause to determine whether or not the legislation reflects what 
the individuals who would be impacted by the legislation would 
see, whether they perceive how it would impact them, and whether 
or not they feel that changes should be made through amendment. 
 
And so the minister came forward with a novel idea in view of the 
expanded committee roles of the Legislative Assembly. And I 
can say, Madam Deputy Speaker, that my colleagues and 
certainly the government colleagues found it to be of interesting 
and worthwhile process. But we still struggled with the fact 
exactly what is our role. And I think the minister indicated 
when we invited him to come back and make a presentation to 
the committee, he didn’t see the committee as necessarily 
formulating a piece of legislation, while we were trying to grab 
a hold of the fact, whether or not we were to formulate a Bill. 
And we certainly didn’t have the expertise in that matter. 
 
[15:15] 
 
However I think at the end of the day, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
the committee members certainly had the pleasure of listening 
to different groups come and make presentations as to how they 
felt artists should be treated in the province of Saskatchewan. 
And we certainly heard. We not only heard from individual 
artists in the province, we heard from some associations that are 
already effectively working in the province of Saskatchewan. 
We also heard from national associations. And it was quite 
apparent to us, Madam Deputy Speaker, that there is even a 
differing opinion from the different groups and individuals. 
 
One of the interesting components of the whole debate and it 
centred around a collective bargaining process. And what I 
noted, Madam Deputy Speaker, and some of my colleagues 
noted as well, the associations and some groups that already 
have, if you will, their own collective agreement were really 
strongly in support of a collective agreement process being part 
of the legislation. Whereas other individuals felt that that wasn’t 
necessarily the right avenue or the route to go. 
 
And so we, over a period of weeks, if you will, and it turned 
into over a period of meeting for two or three months of public 
hearings, the committee members at the end of the day came up 
with some things that they felt that they could certainly agree 
with. But there was certainly a major stumbling block in the 
whole process of legislation and I believe even in the current 
legislation that’s before the Assembly. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, it’s important for us to realize that all 
committee members felt that artists in the province should be 
treated fairly, that they should have avenues open to them 

whereby if they want to form associations . . . And most artists 
agreed that that’s certainly a process they agree with. They are 
not opposed to the ability on their own to become a member of 
or choose which association, if there’s a group of . . . an 
association already in place that is working on behalf of artists, 
whether it’s in the province or even nationally, that they have 
that opportunity. And the concern has been raised and continues 
to be raised about whether or not the putting in place, or in the 
legislation, recommendations regarding a collective agreement, 
whether those would significantly impact individual artists in 
individual associations. 
 
And so, Madam Deputy Speaker, the committee certainly came 
to an agreement and an understanding that we need to recognize 
the fact that artists — and whether they be actors, whether they 
be individuals working with their hands in pottery or painting or 
whether they be a group of singers — should have the ability to 
realize that when they have come to an agreement with . . . And 
as the legislation would acknowledge and the term they use, 
they come to an agreement with an engager, or if you will, a 
group or a company that would like to purchase their services. 
Say it’s a band going out to, for example, a small bar in rural 
Saskatchewan and they’ve agreed to come in and do a couple of 
nights at the bar for X-number of dollars. And in the past, and it 
no doubt continues today, most of these engagements have been 
done through verbal agreement. 
 
And many of my colleagues were quite surprised to hear that in 
the past we have found groups have gone out and maybe the 
clientele wasn’t very good over that weekend and as a result, 
when everything was said and done the band would have ended 
up leaving their engagement with very little in their pocket 
because the engager that had invited them found that they didn’t 
really make much money. There wasn’t much to give even 
though they had verbally agreed to, say, a contract of X-number 
of dollars. 
 
And it was our feeling that people shouldn’t have to live like 
that, that people should be able to . . . And I guess the strong 
suggestion is that maybe people need to start working under 
written agreements. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I think many in this Assembly have 
grown up in the past whereby a man’s word and handshake was 
their bond. And for years many agreements in this province, 
whether they be amongst . . . Even a farming equipment dealer, 
going back years ago because I’ve got a colleague sitting beside 
me who has worked in the farm equipment dealership and 
knows all about signed contracts, but I know that years ago, 
even on the farm that I come from, even with my dad, lots of 
times people would come and he’d sell, he’d sell for example 
seed grain and the agreement was that he would receive so 
many dollars a bushel. And it was a verbal agreement. And 
when the individual was able to make the payment they would 
come and the cheque would be made. And sometimes, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, that cheque may not arrive until the 
opportunity to sell the next load of grain or the next quota 
opened up. But farmers and business people operated that way 
for years. 
 
And no doubt hoteliers and even artists operated that way for 
years. And in many cases I think there were situations where 
people felt they were very well treated. They were respected. 



May 9, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1573 

Their rights were respected. And we agree, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, that while it would be nice maybe in some ways to go 
back to what many people would refer to as the good old days, 
we’ve moved way past that and artists today are facing a real 
challenge when it comes to being appropriately reimbursed for 
their art. 
 
However, having said that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think we 
need to also recognize that the passage of Bill No. 68, The 
Status of the Artist Act, I do not believe at the end of the day 
will change a lot of things for a lot of people. And I trust that 
many of the artists recognize this because there are many 
groups already operating under contractual agreements. And as 
we heard from the many presentations, many groups feel that 
they’re being treated quite fairly in regards to their artistry and 
the different components. Whether it’s actors involved in movie 
making in the province of Saskatchewan, whether it’s bands 
that perform across the province or across the country, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, many of these groups already operate under 
certain guidelines that ensure that they are adequately 
reimbursed as per the contractual agreement they have signed 
with the engager or the group that have hired them to come and 
perform. 
 
So, Madam Deputy Speaker, we recognize the fact that artists 
need to be treated fairly. They need to be rewarded in a 
monetary way that recognizes their work. But we also, I think, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, are aware of the fact that with a 
population of only 1 million people in some ways we’re 
somewhat limited for avenues whereby artists can display their 
work and receive what, in some cases, would be considered 
adequate payment for the time and the hours and the work that 
they put into their individual artistry. And, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, this piece of legislation won’t necessarily change that. 
However we trust that at the end of the day through our 
discussions we’ve brought a greater awareness to artists in the 
province of Saskatchewan and the heritage that this province 
certainly holds to. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, as a province we’re truly blessed. We 
are not only blessed with individuals who have amazing 
musical talent, and certainly even aspiring actors. I know that 
I’ve had the privilege of attending the Regina Christian School 
and some of their productions. Fiddler on the Roof, for 
example, was one. And those — I think it was grade 9 through 
12 — those young people just did a tremendous job, both 
vocally and in their acting, and musically in the presentation of 
a play such as Fiddler on the Roof, and that takes a lot of time 
and effort. And it shows that we have individuals in this 
province who are very gifted in the area of the performing arts. 
 
We also have a First Nations community that, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, that is really gifted when it comes to carvings and 
when it comes to paintings. And, Madam Deputy Speaker, in 
this Legislative Assembly, in the halls of the Assembly, we see 
the works of many of the artists across the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
So it’s important that we not only recognize the artist, but that 
we also do whatever we can to ensure that these artists are 
adequately reimbursed for their work and effort. 
 
There were four recommendations that the committee came up 

with, that the committee could agree to, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, in regards to the status of the artist Bill. One of the 
recommendations was: the committee recommended that 
national agreements should be grandfathered. And in our 
discussion with the minister, it was our understanding that that 
certainly would be recognized, but the grandfathering would be 
only to the extent that those who are already party to existing 
agreements — artists and engagers — continue to be bound by 
them. 
 
And that was one of the key points that was brought to our 
attention by many of the presenters, especially the national 
bodies and individuals who are represented by these national 
bodies, that these agreements should be allowed to continue and 
those artists should not be impacted or this legislation should 
not impact those agreements that are already in place. 
 
And we also recommended that new workplaces that are not 
currently bound by a collective or scale agreement will have to 
be certified under whatever process is established for collective 
bargaining. 
 
We also recognized that and recommended that the definition of 
engager clearly indicate government and contractors as 
engagers. And that the definition of artist needs to include the 
word professional. And that was a recommendation brought to 
us by a couple of the associations that appeared before us. 
 
And when I talk about government, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
there were a couple concerns that were raised in regards to even 
how government displays and the work of artists and how the 
government actually reimburses artists for displaying their work 
even in the Legislative Assembly. 
 
The committee also recommend that intellectual property rights 
remain with the artist unless a contract exists or specifically 
states otherwise. And there was one group that appeared before 
the committee and had some real concerns in regards to 
property rights, and that was the photographers association. 
And they basically indicated . . . or one of their suggestions was 
the procurement policy and registration process should 
immediately be revised to remove any and all requirements 
which force photographers to give up the copyrights and/or 
waive moral rights. And they said as part of the registration 
process professional photographers should have to demonstrate 
their capabilities and credentials by presenting a portfolio, 
providing proof of experience and educational background, 
producing proof of liability insurance, providing evidence of 
membership in an industry-related association, and supplying 
work-related references. 
 
And they made those recommendations and the reasons they 
gave were . . . They gave a bit of a background as to the reasons 
why they felt this was important. And they said the current 
Saskatchewan government procurement policy states that 
photographers, in order to become registered on the supplier 
list, must agree to give up copyrights and waive moral rights in 
all work produced for the government and its Crowns. 
 
And, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think most of the members on 
the committee were quite surprised in that comment and that 
concern raised by the photographers. 
 



1574 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

They continue that no negotiation is allowed and no 
compensation is offered. This is unfair and we agreed with the 
photographers. As a result there was a growing number of very 
skilled professional photographers in the province that will not 
register because of these requirements, in fact not register with 
the government. 
 
During this past year they say the policy is being expanded to 
cover the advertising agencies that work for the government and 
its Crowns, thereby forcing those agencies to sever long, 
productive, and rewarding relationships with these professional 
photographers and their clients. 
 
It’s quite apparent, Madam Deputy Speaker, that government is 
not immune from not treating artists with the same fairness that 
they would endeavour or suggest that they have been or that 
artists should be receiving. And to many of the . . . in fact I 
believe all committee members were somewhat surprised by the 
presentation that the photographers made, and we certainly 
agree that they brought forward some very strong arguments. 
And I believe their recommendations became part of the 
recommendations in the report that was presented to the 
minister. The committee also agreed that language in the Act 
must respect the potential mix of self-employed and employed 
artists — artists as employees. There must be no jeopardizing of 
the dual status of artists for tax purposes. Madam Deputy 
Speaker, we think that certainly was important. And like I say, 
there were the four points that all members could agree with in 
regards to the legislation and The Status of the Artist Act. 
 
[15:30] 
 
However the one sticker was the collective bargaining process 
that government members continue to argue and suggest needed 
to be part of the Act. Now, Madam Deputy Speaker, we don’t 
have a problem with people themselves gathering together and 
if they felt that they wanted to form an association, that’s their 
right to do. That’s their right to make that choice. 
 
We felt that it’s imperative though that it shouldn’t be just a 
small body of individuals, that everyone should have that 
opportunity and voice. We’re also concerned that just by 
putting it in the legislation, does that give a small group the 
ability to form an association? Then everyone else who happens 
to be . . . whether it’s singers, whether it’s musicians, now has 
to conform to whatever agreement may be drawn up by a small 
body. And I believe that the information that we were presented 
with, everyone felt that they wanted to have a voice, that they 
needed to have a voice before any association or collective 
agreement could be brought forward. 
 
And that was one of the major stumbling blocks and continues 
to be a stumbling block in regards to this legislation. Because 
it’s important, Madam Deputy Speaker, that as we look at 
artists, each and every one indicated that in many ways they’re 
individuals. They have individual abilities. And as they perform 
whether . . . perform their artistry or their work as actors or 
singers or musicians, that they felt that they wanted to have the 
ability to . . . If there was a national association that they could 
work through and felt that they could be very comfortable with, 
that was something they felt they should have the opportunity to 
choose, not be legislated to be part of an organization. 
 

So, Madam Deputy Speaker, this piece of legislation, while it 
. . . and I believe the minister was indicating the reasons were to 
bring into place a process whereby we, a more formal way I 
believe, recognize the contribution of artists to the culture of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
I think at the end of the day, Madam Deputy Speaker, when it 
comes to artists and their ability to perform and to continue to 
operate and to receive fair compensation, we’re certainly going 
to have to look beyond just 1 million people in the province of 
Saskatchewan. We certainly have to build the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
We need to have more people moving to this province, and not 
just individuals just to fill the roles of the standard, everyday, 
9-to-5 job — jobs that are available. But as well, Madam 
Deputy Speaker, we need individuals and organizations that 
will move and bring, set up businesses and large corporations 
and set up head offices because in some cases they’re the type 
of individuals that really support the higher groups, if you will 
— artistry — that we have in the province of Saskatchewan: the 
symphony for example or Globe Theatre. 
 
Not all residents necessarily attend the symphony or attend 
Globe Theatre, although I believe Globe Theatre is the type of 
performing arts that more people would take the opportunity to 
attend. But I do know that anyone who’s attended the Regina 
Symphony has really been amazed at the work and the 
performance that has been presented. 
 
And there I think, Madam Deputy Speaker, we all know that in 
the presentation that was made to us, I believe there are 12 
individuals actually on the symphony that are full-time 
employees, and the rest are individuals who are either 
individually employed or working for a company, but are 
skilled with different musical instruments, who have become 
part of the overall symphony. And I know my daughter recently 
had the privilege of going and was quite amazed. In fact she 
thoroughly enjoyed the presentation that she attended. 
 
Now one of the comments, one of the questions that was asked 
of the group that represented the symphony was, in view of the 
fact that they have sold-out concerts, would it not suit them well 
to run maybe a series of concerts — two or three nights — and 
thereby deriving more revenue whereby they could pay the 
musicians at a higher rate or even the part-time musicians pay 
them at a higher rate. 
 
And the interesting thing, Madam Deputy Speaker, was the fact 
that while they are sold-out concerts when they do have them, 
the issue that was raised was by doing two or three concerts in a 
row doesn’t necessarily mean a sellout every night. And by not 
selling out every night, they have a diminishing return which 
means that they have less dollars at the end of the day to work 
with. And that’s therefore . . . I guess their view is if we can do 
a concert and — two or three a year at separate times — and 
sell that concert out, we’re much better off than trying to do two 
or three in a row, especially given the fact that we do have a 
number of members who are just part-time musicians in the 
symphony. And that speaks, Madam Deputy Speaker, to the 
fact that we really do not have the large population base to 
really give their support to organizations like the symphony to 
ensure that they can derive the revenue they need to pay their 



May 9, 2007 Saskatchewan Hansard 1575 

artists in a manner that they feel would be appropriate. 
 
So, Madam Deputy Speaker, the interesting thing about this 
piece of legislation, I think, is the fact that some people feel 
legislation would be the saviour for them, if you will, or will 
provide them with the means whereby they receive greater 
recognition and as a result of the legislation that they would 
receive greater remuneration for their works. 
 
And I beg to differ, Madam Deputy Speaker, and suggest that 
this is not going to be the saviour for a lot of artists. This is not 
going to give a lot of artists the ability to, if you will, leave their 
day job and become the full-time artist that they may wish to 
be. But certainly what it will do, I believe, is bring maybe a 
little more into the open the fact that this province is blessed 
with many, many artists. 
 
And when I talk about artists, when I talk about artists, Madam 
Deputy Speaker . . . and I’m not exactly sure for people in the 
large urban centres how they perceive artists. They no doubt 
would look at Globe Theatre or the Regina Symphony or the, I 
believe it’s . . . There’s one weekend in the downtown Regina 
where a number of artists do gather to display their wares. 
 
But I know that around rural Saskatchewan, we have many 
individuals and many groups who have begun to work together 
in order to display their art, and through the process of working 
together they’ve been able to have a public display of their art. 
And as a result they’ve had the ability to sell their art to more 
and larger audience of people. 
 
And I think, Madam Deputy Speaker, of a group, the Wolseley 
arts guild. And that group actually formed after a couple 
individuals were asking each other and talking about, well how 
do you market your art? How do you let people know what you 
do and let people be aware of the type of art you’re putting 
together and get a return if you’re interested in selling that art? 
 
And two or three people got together, and they decided all of 
sudden . . . I think what happened was they recognized that they 
were not the only individuals in the area that were involved in 
art. Some were involved in painting. Some were involved in 
photography. A number were involved in sculptural work. And 
these individuals, as they began to speak amongst themselves, 
realized that there were quite a number of individual artists in 
the area who would like to let people know all about their art 
and would like to display their art and give people an 
opportunity to purchase that art. And they decided to just form, 
if you will, in a small way an association whereby they could 
display that art. 
 
And I’ve had the privilege, Madam Deputy Speaker, of going to 
some of their art displays and forums. And I would suggest to 
you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that it’s something to behold 
when you see the type of art and the artistry that we have in the 
province of Saskatchewan. And as a result of that association, 
more people have become aware of the artistic nature of the 
people in the province of Saskatchewan in the Wolseley area. I 
know around the Rocanville area, the Whitewood area as well 
individuals have gotten together. 
 
One of the other concerns we have with the legislation is the 
term engagers. And the concern about . . . And I believe 

engagers, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be individuals or 
organizations who would apply to or would hire artists to come 
and perform either through a public concert or in a smaller 
gathering. And there’s a piece of the Bill that talks about 
engagers forming associations. Now I’m not aware of engagers 
that really came forward and suggested that they felt they 
needed to be part of a form of association. We do have some 
questions in regards to that piece of the legislation. 
 
But, Madam Deputy Speaker, I think as we had the privilege as 
a committee to talk to the many artists, the many associations, 
we realize that there’s a broad scope of how people visualize 
the arts in the province of Saskatchewan. We also recognize, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, that people also felt that it’s important 
that artists have the privilege of having their specific art 
displayed and receiving proper remuneration for that art or for 
that gift in music or whatever artist’s art they are performing in. 
 
And so, Madam Deputy Speaker, I might add that while I 
enjoyed the process, we also recognize that there was a split in 
the committee as to how we should move forward with this 
piece of legislation. And I would like to add that I think we 
were, at the end of the day, were pleased that the minister took 
the time then to sit down and come forward with a number of 
suggestions as to what he perceived or wanted to see in this 
legislation. 
 
And we’re certainly taking the time and we want to take the 
time to ensure that all associations, artists and engagers have the 
ability to look through the legislation — it’s quite a complex 
piece of legislation — to ensure that we have proper 
communication, and there’s a proper consultation process. 
Therefore at this time I move to adjourn debate. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member from Moosomin has 
moved to adjourn debate on Bill No. 68, The Status of the Artist 
Act, 2007. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Carried. I recognize the Government 
House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — Madam Deputy Speaker, before moving 
adjournment of the House, I’d ask leave of the House for 
purposes of making an introduction. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The minister has asked leave to 
introduce guests. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Carried. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Hon. Mr. Hagel: — We don’t need a whole motion; just leave 
is fine thanks, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam Deputy 
Speaker, I am pleased that we’ve been joined over the course of 
the debate on the status of the artist Bill before us by some very 
interested people from organizations representing the arts. 



1576 Saskatchewan Hansard May 9, 2007 

And I’d like to ask the House to acknowledge the executive 
director of the Saskatchewan Arts Alliance, Marnie Gladwell. 
And seated beside her from ACTRA [Alliance of Canadian 
Cinema, Television, and Radio Artists] is Mike Burns. And also 
I recognize Brian Dojack who is the Saskatchewan CEO [chief 
executive officer] of the American Federation of Musicians. 
 
I would ask all hon. members to show welcome to these people 
from the arts organizations in the province. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Madam Deputy Speaker, I’d like to join the 
minister in offering our words of welcome to the members of 
the arts community that have joined us this afternoon. We’ve 
come to know most of them on a pretty personal basis as a 
result of the process that we’ve gone through on The Status of 
the Artist Act. My colleague from Moosomin elaborated a lot of 
the process. We have learned much as a result of this exercise, 
and I think the communication and the level of understanding 
has been enhanced through this process. We’ve welcomed the 
input of many of these people and the organizations they 
represent. And we’re glad to see that they’re in the House today 
to observe the proceedings of the House as this Bill moves 
forward. 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the Government House
