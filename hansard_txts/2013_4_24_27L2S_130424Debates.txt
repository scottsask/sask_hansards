 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 3355 

 April 24, 2013 

 

[The Assembly met at 13:30.] 

 

[Prayers] 

 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Parks, Culture and 

Sport. 

 

Hon. Mr. Doherty: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 

to you and through you to the rest of the Assembly, I would like 

to introduce some special guests in the legislature today as we 

celebrate National Volunteer Week. Today we have some of 

these fine volunteers with us. You will hear a little bit more 

about the great work that these particular volunteers do, Mr. 

Speaker, in a member’s statement that is to follow here shortly, 

but I’d just like to mention who these people are. 

 

Seated in the government gallery, Mr. Speaker, we have the 

following members of the tea steering committee for 

Government House. We have Barb Binnie — you can just give 

us a wave, Barb; there we are — who is this year’s recipient of 

the Marj Ewart and Betty Westmoreland Volunteer Award. We 

have Leona Howe. We have Sheila Carson, Connie Van Dusen 

who is also the special events coordinator. And we also have 

with us members of the Government House Historical Society 

board, Mr. Speaker. We have Janice Routley, from the board of 

directors. We have Iris Sirke, vice-president and treasurer; 

Isabelle Zohner who is the president. 

 

And I had the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago 

to attend their awards ceremony and had a great evening with 

their folks and the association. Accompanying them as well is 

Carrie Ross, the executive director of Government House; Chad 

Debert, assistant manager; Amanda Girardin, visitor experience 

manager; and Gwen Jacobson, director of operations with the 

Provincial Capital Commission. 

 

Mr. Speaker, these folks are very excited to be here today, so I 

ask that all members please join me in giving them a warm 

welcome to their legislature. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Elphinstone-Centre. 

 

Mr. McCall: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’d like 

to, on behalf of the official opposition, to join with the minister 

in welcoming these folks who work so hard at Government 

House, both as volunteers through the society, but as staff 

through the Provincial Capital Commission as well. Certainly 

it’s a real jewel here in the Queen City that we’re all very proud 

of, and we are thankful for the great work that is done to make 

it all that it is. 

 

So I join with the minister in thanking these people for the 

important work that they do. And we look forward to the 

member’s statement coming up. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Central Services. 

 

Hon. Ms. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would ask 

all my colleagues in the House to welcome 29 public service 

employees that are seated in your gallery. They are here today 

to participate in the parliamentary program for the public 

service. The ministries represented today are folks from 

Agriculture, Central Services, Economy, Finance, Health, 

Justice, Labour Relations and Workplace Safety, Provincial 

Capital Commission, Public Service Commission, Social 

Services, and the Legislative Assembly Service. 

 

Mr. Speaker, it’s a day that they get to spend in the legislature 

taking in tours, speaking with various people who are involved 

in the process including, I believe, folks from your office and 

you as well and members of the opposition. And I look forward 

to meeting with them later today to discuss what it’s like to be a 

cabinet minister and an MLA [Member of the Legislative 

Assembly]. And I ask all my colleagues to welcome them to 

their legislature today. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to join with 

the member opposite in welcoming the group from the public 

service. We know it’s an action-packed day of meetings and 

events, receiving some exposure to what goes on here in the 

legislature. 

 

And we want to say thank you for all the work that you do 

throughout the year in providing services to people in this 

province and helping with the policy work that needs to be done 

here in Saskatchewan. And I look forward to meeting with you 

later on this afternoon and having a visit and having some 

questions and answers, hopefully. So welcome today, and I 

hope you have an informative and enjoyable afternoon. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 

through you to all members of the Legislative Assembly, I’d 

like to take this opportunity during the proclamation of National 

Immunization Awareness Week to recognize representatives 

from the Rx&D, that’s Canada’s research-based pharmaceutical 

company. Seated in your gallery are Renae Hunter, Phoenix 

Clarke, and Bonnie Swan. 

 

The Rx&D’s mission is to continually improve the ability to 

treat, manage, and prevent, cure illnesses that affect many 

Canadians, Mr. Speaker. And we want to welcome these 

individuals on this particularly special week, Mr. Speaker. 

Thank you. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to introduce 

to you and through you to all members, three individuals seated 

in your gallery: Trevor McKenzie-Smith, Michelle Beveridge, 

and Dave Mitchell, three individuals that are active within the 

New Democratic Party. 

 

Trevor was the co-manager for my leadership campaign, and I 

very much want to thank him for all the work that he did. 

Michelle and Dave were active on another campaign, and are 



3356 Saskatchewan Hansard April 24, 2013 

very talented as well. And I’m very pleased that we’re on the 

same team now. So I’d ask all members to welcome these 

individuals to the Assembly. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Coronation Park. 

 

Mr. Docherty: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to join with 

the minister in welcoming the representatives of the public 

service here today. And in particular I’d like to welcome two of 

my old co-workers, Stella Juma-Anderson — give us a wave — 

and Donna Wilchuck, both members that I worked with at 

immigration. I’d like to welcome them on behalf of the 

government again. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Athabasca. 

 

Mr. Belanger: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’m 

very pleased to stand today to present a petition in reference to 

cellphone coverage for the northwest. And, Mr. Speaker, the 

petition reads as follows in the prayer: 

 

To undertake, as soon as possible, to ensure SaskTel 

delivers cell service to the Canoe Lake First Nations, 

along with the adjoining communities of Cole Bay and 

Jans Bay; Buffalo River First Nations, also known as 

Dillon, and the neighbouring communities of Michel 

Village and St. George’s Hill; English River First Nations, 

also known as Patuanak, and the hamlet of Patuanak; and 

Birch Narrows First Nations along with the community of 

Turnor Lake, and all the adjoining and neighbouring 

communities in all of these areas. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, the people that have signed this particular 

petition are primarily from St. George’s Hill and Dillon. And 

the amazing thing about this petition is that it’s been signed 

from people from all throughout Saskatchewan. And I so 

present. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 

 

Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I rise 

today to present a petition calling for the reconsideration of 

passing Bill 85, The Saskatchewan Employment Act. And we 

know since the Act was introduced in December, literally 

hundreds of hours of study and comparison have been carried 

out in the interests of due diligence. But we know there’s no 

labour relations crisis to fix and no necessity to rush this 

omnibus bill through that will likely govern workplace relations 

for decades to come. Stable labour relations in all sectors run 

the risk of being thrown into turmoil as a result of Bill 85’s 

sweeping changes. Thousands of represented workers stand to 

lose their rights to bargain collectively and be represented by 

the union of their choice. I’d like to read the prayer: 

 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully 

request that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan 

take the following action: cause the Government of 

Saskatchewan to not pass Bill 85, The Saskatchewan 

Employment Act in this current session before the end of 

May and to place it on a much longer legislative track to 

ensure greater understanding and support for the new 

labour law. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, people signing this petition come from 

Shellbrook, Spiritwood, Leoville and Big River. I do so present. 

Thank you. 

 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member from Last 

Mountain-Touchwood. 

 

Administrative Professionals Day 

 

Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’m 

pleased to rise in the House today to recognize Administrative 

Professionals Day. Today is an opportunity for members to 

express gratitude and appreciation for some of the hardest 

working people in our workplaces. Mr. Speaker, I would like to 

specifically recognize all those who work in caucus and 

ministers’ offices as well as constituency offices across the 

province. 

 

I know I’m speaking for our entire caucus, Mr. Speaker, when I 

say we are able to perform our duties more effectively thanks to 

the hard work that Terry Lynn Carefoot does each day and 

every day in our caucus office. I would also like to recognize 

and thank all the constituency assistants who act as our eyes 

and ears at home when we can’t be there and are our vital link 

with our constituents. I’d especially like to thank my CA 

[constituency assistant], Carol Mellnick, who has worked with 

me for the past 14 years. 

 

Mr. Speaker, these individuals provide professional, efficient, 

and timely assistance that goes well beyond what is required. 

They are detail people and the work they do all too often goes 

unrecognized. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all 

administrative professionals that I work with, and I encourage 

all members to make this a special day for those professionals 

who keep us on track day in and day out. Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Opposition Whip. 

 

Walk to Ottawa 

 

Mr. Vermette: — Mr. Speaker, Bruce McKenzie, a member of 

Lac La Ronge Indian Band and a resident of Stanley Mission, 

has organized a walk to Ottawa in protest of the Conservative 

government Bill C-45. Bruce, along with seven other 

community members, left Stanley Mission on Saturday, March 

16th and they plan to arrive in Ottawa on June 21st, National 

Aboriginal Day. The 3450 kilometre walk will go through the 

communities of Saskatoon, Yorkton, Winnipeg, Thunder Bay, 

Sault Ste. Marie, and finally Ottawa. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the walkers have already walked over 1000 

kilometres. They arrived in Winnipeg this past weekend and 

participated in the 7th Generation Walk for Mother Earth on 

Sunday, April 21st. Mr. Speaker, the walk has been honoured 

with the name “A Sacred Journey for Future Generations.” As 

part of the Idle No More movement the organizers believe that 

Bill C-45 will have long-term impact on the environment and 



April 24, 2013 Saskatchewan Hansard 3357 

will also have negative effects on treaty and Aboriginal rights. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I pray the Creator will provide Mr. McKenzie and 

all those that will participate in this walk a safe journey. I ask 

all members to join me in honouring these walkers. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Qu’Appelle Valley. 

 

Recognizing Government House Volunteers 

 

Ms. Ross: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 

this week we pay tribute to volunteers as we celebrate National 

Volunteer Week. This year’s campaign recognizes individual 

volunteers across Canada who dedicate themselves to 

improving their communities. And that is why today, Mr. 

Speaker, I would like to take this time to recognize the 

volunteers from the Government House Historical Society. 

 

In 2012 the Government House Historical Society volunteers 

contributed over 10,000 hours of their time at events, functions 

that brought visitors to Government House. This group of 

volunteers fundraise, restore original Government House 

artifacts and assist at Government House functions.  

 

They also hold a number of their own events throughout the 

year. From their popular Victorian teas, which recently received 

international recognition by winning This England’s Finest Tea 

Room Award, to their black tie auction, to their growing junior 

volunteer club called Jocko’s Friends, last year their events 

translated into almost 3,300 additional visitor hours to 

Government House. 

 

They also set a fine example to their junior members, who 

volunteer over 100 hours themselves. Mr. Speaker, many of the 

special events and programs at Government House would not 

be possible without these selfless volunteers. Thank you very 

much, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Riversdale. 

 

Stubborn Behaviour 

 

Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, well, well, we 

have a problem here. We have all seen the stubborn behaviour, 

the lack of action, the refusal to admit mistakes. Some things 

never change, Mr. Speaker. Day after day we see the same 

thing, and it’s unacceptable. And the people of Saskatchewan 

frankly deserve better. 

 

He has no new ideas, and in recent weeks we haven’t seen his 

leadership. Sometimes he’s angry. Sometimes he’s mild, and 

sometimes he blusters. We have heard complaints from across 

the province. Coffee row is talking about nothing else, Mr. 

Speaker. Criticism is gusting in from all sides. 

 

And you want to talk about flip-flopping, Mr. Speaker? Some 

days we think we see cracks in the ice, but other days there is a 

chill in the air. The people of Saskatchewan are tired and 

demand a change. We’ve seen enough of these tactics, Mr. 

Speaker. He’s been around too long. It’s time for old man 

winter to retire. 

As the people of Saskatchewan try to escape his grip, he 

continues with his same old approach. Mr. Speaker, he has shut 

down a record number of roads this year. We are all familiar 

with his past record but the jury is still out, Mr. Speaker. The 

people of Saskatchewan can’t decide if his record was worse in 

the winter of 1947 or with the storm in 1974. What they do 

know, Mr. Speaker, is that six months of old man winter is too 

long. Hopefully the spring brings winds of change. 

 

[13:45] 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina South. 

 

National Immunization Awareness Week 

 

Mr. Hutchinson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As was 

referenced earlier today, this is National Immunization 

Awareness Week, Mr. Speaker. This is an opportunity to reflect 

on the success of immunization in preventing disease and 

saving lives and also to remind Saskatchewan residents about 

the importance of being vaccinated. 

 

Over the past 50 years, vaccines have saved the lives of more 

babies and children than any other medical intervention. Mr. 

Speaker, Saskatchewan has shown true leadership in vaccine 

management. We were in fact the first province to vaccinate all 

children born on-reserve for hepatitis A, and in 2010 we were 

also amongst the first to introduce a whooping cough booster 

and have since expanded its availability to all adults. 

 

Our province offers a comprehensive immunization program. 

Each year Saskatchewan people receive some 550,000 

immunizations against diseases, including 175,000 influenza 

vaccines. We provide vaccines for routine infant, preschool, 

and school immunization programs as well as for adults. 

 

Mr. Speaker, last fall we expanded our infant immunization 

program by adding a rotavirus vaccine to the routine childhood 

immunization schedule that will reduce hospitalizations for 

small children. Our government will continue to work with 

health care providers to deliver the best possible health care, to 

prevent our . . . [inaudible interjection] . . . Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker . . . to ensure that our people do well in our growing 

province. Thank you so much. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Batoche. 

 

Stobart Community School Grand Opening 

 

Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to rise 

today to highlight one of our government’s investments in my 

home constituency of Batoche. Mr. Speaker, our government 

knows that investing in school infrastructure is investing in our 

students. 

 

Last week I had the opportunity to witness that first-hand by 

attending the grand opening of Stobart Community School in 

the community of Duck Lake. In 2008 our government 

announced funding for this project, and it was great to see the 

community come together to celebrate its completion. We want 

to do everything we can to ensure students’ success, Mr. 

Speaker, and we know that the physical environment of the 

school has a large impact on achieving just that. Stobart 



3358 Saskatchewan Hansard April 24, 2013 

Community School is a great example of what linking 

education to the larger community can look like. 

 

This $20 million facility boasts many important features, 

including child and daycare centres, adult learning, an industrial 

arts classrooms, a full-size kitchen centre, regional college 

space, two gyms, and a community fitness room which ensures 

that this school will be a community hub for years to come. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I am proud of our government’s record for school 

infrastructure: over 600 million to support our students and our 

communities to date, and we won’t stop there. Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

Moose Jaw Bantam Oilers Win Provincial Championship 

 

Mr. Lawrence: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to 

commend the hard work and dedication of the Moose Jaw 

Bantam Oilers. The Oilers have recently wrapped up a 

successful season, making it to the league final in Moose Jaw, 

then going on to win the provincial championships. The team 

and their coaches travelled to the provincial championships in 

Saskatoon where they beat out the Saskatoon Red Wings in a 

very exciting two-game, total-point series by a score of 11 to 9. 

 

We all know the commitment coaches and parents make to 

minor sports, and it takes a committed group to help get to this 

level. Congratulation to the coaches, Gord Currie, Jeff Parr, 

Dave Stevenson, and Brett McAuley. It was a focused team 

effort that accomplished this victory, and now the provincial 

banner will proudly hang in the Bert Hunt Arena for years to 

come. 

 

To quote the great one who was also an Oiler, “Hockey is a 

unique sport in the sense that you need each and every guy 

helping each other and pulling in the same direction to be 

successful.” 

 

I ask that all members of this Assembly join me in 

congratulating the Moose Jaw Bantam Oilers on their win, and 

recognizing all the hard work, commitment, and dedication by 

everyone involved with the team. 

 

Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

QUESTION PERIOD 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 

 

Health Care for Seniors 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We’ve heard many 

examples over the past week of instances where the care for 

seniors in our province is simply not up to the standards that we 

expect for our parents and our grandparents. And frankly, Mr. 

Speaker, it’s not close to the standard that they deserve. We’ve 

heard about calls for help, Mr. Speaker, in care facilities not 

being answered. We’ve heard about seniors being left 

unattended on toilets for hours because the staff were not 

properly in the numbers there to care for them. We’ve heard 

about seniors missing their weekly baths, Mr. Speaker, all 

because of chronic understaffing. 

 

But none of that seemed to get the Premier’s attention. But 

perhaps this will. Barbara Blyth is 84 years old. She has 

incurable cancer, and she recently broke her foot. Barbara’s 

home care worker concluded that it was not healthy or safe for 

Barbara to be in her own home. But there was absolutely 

nowhere for Barbara to go, so she ended up in a women’s 

shelter. 

 

My specific question to the Deputy Premier: does he think it’s 

acceptable to put an 84-year-old woman with cancer, with a 

broken foot, in a women’s shelter? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. We 

within the health care system strive to provide the appropriate 

care in the appropriate setting where we can, where that is 

possible, Mr. Speaker. 

 

I’m not aware of the particulars of the case, Mr. Speaker. I 

would be very happy to follow up with the Leader of the 

Opposition. But certainly I would make that offer to him to 

follow up directly with this individual. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, this 84-year-old woman with 

cancer and a broken foot lives in La Ronge, and she recently 

wrote a public letter which says: 

 

There is a desperate need for long-term care here in 

northern Saskatchewan, but I was not surprised at all to 

see it ignored when the budget came out recently . . . 

 

In 2010, a report indicated that La Ronge needs three 

times as many long-term care beds than it has currently, 

yet there’s nothing in the budget for the community. 

 

Barbara Blyth wants to know, Mr. Speaker, why seniors’ care, 

especially seniors’ care in northern Saskatchewan, is not nearly 

enough of a priority for the Sask Party government. My 

question to the Deputy Premier: what does he have to say to 

Barbara Blyth and the situation that she has found herself in? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, we certainly know that this 

has been in fact a long-standing issue in terms of long-term bed 

coverage within northern Saskatchewan, particularly in the La 

Ronge area, Mr. Speaker. We have tried to provide supports to 

that health region, Mr. Speaker, through increased funding. As 

well, Mr. Speaker, where there are other options for care, 

perhaps in personal care homes, Mr. Speaker, we have provided 

additional funding to and a new program through this 

government, Mr. Speaker, to subsidize the cost of personal 

private care homes, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we know that we have a long ways to go when it 

comes to not only the replacement of long-term care facilities. 

We currently have a budget, money in this budget, Mr. Speaker, 



April 24, 2013 Saskatchewan Hansard 3359 

to continue with 12 of the 13 that have already been announced, 

Mr. Speaker. But we certainly know that this is a, particularly 

for the area of La Ronge, this is a long-standing issue that 

frankly does need to be addressed. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, Barbara Blyth is concerned about 

her experience and what happened to her, and rightfully so. She 

had this to say in the public letter that she wrote: 

 

The Saskatchewan Party government is refusing to give 

northern seniors what they deserve — respect and 

long-term care closer to their families. I doubt that 

Premier Wall would allow this to happen if there was a 

similar shortage of spaces in Swift Current. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Sask Party government is refusing to give 

northern seniors what they deserve. And this is the reality that 

Barbara Blyth knows all too well for herself and many other 

people living in the North. And it’s a reality shared by many 

people throughout Saskatchewan, not just in the North, Mr. 

Speaker. The Sask Party government is stubbornly refusing to 

take the right steps in order to ensure that people like Barbara 

Blyth don’t end up in the situation that she experienced. 

 

My question to the Deputy Premier: will he admit that the 

seniors here in Saskatchewan deserve far better than what 

they’re getting under the Sask Party government? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, in general, senior support 

by this government, compared to the members opposite, Mr. 

Speaker, has seen a significant increase in support — whether it 

be the seniors’ income plan, which the members opposite 

increased in 1991, Mr. Speaker, and then never again for 16 

years touched the seniors’ income plan, Mr. Speaker, or 

whether it be subsidizing care for those seniors that are in 

personal care homes, Mr. Speaker. We have a program in place 

that subsidizes the cost of personal care home placement, Mr. 

Speaker. We have doubled the number of seniors that are 

eligible for the seniors’ income plan, Mr. Speaker — something 

that the members opposite could have done in their days in 

office, Mr. Speaker. They had 16 years to do that, Mr. Speaker, 

and they didn’t do that, Mr. Speaker. 

 

As well, Mr. Speaker, we acknowledge that we need to do more 

in long-term care in terms of replacing aging facilities, Mr. 

Speaker. The members opposite will know that over $1.2 

billion was required to replace and to upgrade long-term health 

capital, Mr. Speaker, in this province. We are making strides to 

do that, included in this budget for 12 long-term care facilities. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 

 

Mr. Broten: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Members opposite 

can give these answers, Mr. Speaker, but the problem is, is that 

there’s an increasing sense of a disconnect between the answers 

that government members on the front bench are giving and 

what’s being experienced by people in their communities. 

 

And we see it very clear, Mr. Speaker, with the situation of 

Barbara. We saw it with Carrie Klassen, Mr. Speaker. And 

we’ve heard and we’ve seen it as other individuals have come 

forward, have come forward to share their stories and show that 

they’re not receiving the care that they need. 

 

When we look at the decisions that have happened under the 

Sask Party government, Mr. Speaker, we see a discussion about 

the possible closure of the pediatric oncology ward and the 

pediatric intensive care unit. We see a hiring freeze and 

elimination of overtime in the Saskatoon Health Region. In 

Regina, Mr. Speaker, we have the very troubling situation of a 

man being cut off from home care services, aware that the same 

letter was sent out to many other people. We see chronic 

understaffing, Mr. Speaker, concerns from front-line health care 

providers about the type of care that they’re able to provide to 

residents. And, Mr. Speaker, we have an 84-year-old woman in 

La Ronge with a broken foot, with cancer, with nowhere to go 

and forced to go to a women’s shelter. 

 

None of this would we expect, Mr. Speaker, when the economy 

is doing as well as it is, and this is the disconnect. My question 

to the Deputy Premier: why do we increasingly have these 

examples of where health care is not meeting the needs of 

Saskatchewan people at a time when the Saskatchewan 

economy is doing well? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 

 

Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Well, Mr. Speaker, much of the 

preamble of the Leader of the Opposition is factually incorrect. 

Mr. Speaker, support to regional health authorities that deliver 

health care services and the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency that 

provide cancer support for people in this province is up 

dramatically from the members opposite when they left 

government, Mr. Speaker — $1 billion in additional funding for 

our regional health authorities. That’s up 45 per cent, Mr. 

Speaker, in just six years. 

 

As well, Mr. Speaker, for the Cancer Agency it’s up $12 

million in this budget, Mr. Speaker — an increase of 90 per 

cent for the Cancer Agency since when the members opposite 

were in government, as well as front-line staff, Mr. Speaker. 

We know we have made tremendous gains in hiring front-line 

staff, providing dollars to regional health authorities to hire 

front-line staff, Mr. Speaker. SUN [Saskatchewan Union of 

Nurses] up 18 per cent, over 1,000 nurses in this province, Mr. 

Speaker, compared to the members opposite; Health Sciences, 

up 21 per cent; and the provider unions in general, up eight and 

a half per cent, Mr. Speaker. 

 

More work needs to be done. But, Mr. Speaker, this 

government has a tremendous record compared to the members 

opposite in providing dollars and front-line support for health 

and for people that need health care services in this province. 

 

The Speaker: — Yesterday the Minister for the Environment 

indicated that he would respond today to a question that was 

posed to him yesterday. It would be helpful though if the 

ministers in taking, indicating a response at a later date, take 

notice, is what the proper terminology is and that no further 

responses to that question be given after having taken notice. 

 

I recognize the Minister for the Environment. 



3360 Saskatchewan Hansard April 24, 2013 

Fort Qu’Appelle Fish Culture Station 

 

Hon. Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you very much, Mr. 

Speaker, for that. Yesterday I attempted to take notice of a 

question, but didn’t use the right phraseology, but indeed my 

intent is to report back to the House today. 

 

The premise of the questions from the Environment critic 

yesterday were totally false again. No privatization is taking 

place at the office of the provincial fish hatchery in Fort 

Qu’Appelle. No privatization discussions whatsoever have 

taken place regarding this facility. 

 

The Fish and Wildlife Development Fund steering committee 

have put a proposal forward to administer the operations of the 

provincial fish hatchery. Consultations would have to take place 

in this regard. The fish hatchery is not for sale. No job losses 

will happen. Regardless of what decisions are made in the 

future, the administration of the provincial hatchery would 

continue to report to the Minister of Environment. 

 

The Fish and Wildlife Development Fund steering committee is 

concerned about a decision made by the previous government 

to take money out of the fund to fund Ministry of Environment 

staff. We are working to correct that. So no old-style NDP 

[New Democratic Party] fearmongering is needed or 

appreciated, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Nutana. 

 

Racetrack Licences 

 

Ms. Sproule: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In yesterday’s 

Leader-Post there’s a feature on 130 cool, sporty things to do in 

Regina. No. 11 on the list is horse racing at West Meadows 

Raceway. But, Mr. Speaker, it could soon be forced off the list. 

 

For the past six years, in good faith, the operators of West 

Meadows Raceway have worked with SLGA [Saskatchewan 

Liquor and Gaming Authority] to advance standardbred racing. 

They were looking for a whole market area licence because 

such a licence would allow their business to be self-sustaining, 

using revenues generated from horse wagering. 

 

Mr. Speaker, getting this licence would have encouraged 

business growth for rural and urban communities alike. Why 

would the Sask Party government deny the licence to West 

Meadows Raceway and prevent the reinstatement of the 

standardbred horse racing industry in Regina? 

 

[14:00] 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Crown 

Investments. 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, the question is, is there 

enough revenue in horse racing in the province of 

Saskatchewan to warrant two home market areas? West 

Meadows, which is a privately owned racetrack outside of 

Regina that has two years of racing history, would say yes. 

Marquis Downs, however, the thoroughbred racetrack at 

Prairieland Park in Saskatoon with over 125 years of history in 

racing, would say no. And Cornerstone, the standardbred 

racetrack in Yorkton exhibition with over 60 years of racing 

history, would also say no. 

 

The struggle with horse racing across our country, quite 

frankly, is that betting dollars have decreased year over year, 

and we’ve seen that indeed also in Saskatchewan. So what is 

also happening is the home market area is also becoming less 

and less profitable. The history within Saskatchewan is a 

decade ago, Regina closed and gave up the home market area 

because there wasn’t enough revenue to support two home 

market areas in Saskatchewan. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Nutana. 

 

Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, the president of West Meadows 

Raceway, Jane Grainger, joins us in the gallery today, along 

with Glenn LeDrew of the Saskatchewan Standardbred 

Horsemen’s Association and 15 other concerned citizens and 

entrepreneurs. Ms. Grainger and Mr. LeDrew are concerned 

about the apparent favouritism showed by the Sask Party 

government by only allowing one raceway licence in the entire 

province instead of restoring it to the two licences that used to 

be in place before Queensbury Downs was shut down in 2002. 

 

The minister said in committee that Prairieland Park 

approached the government about their commercial 

non-viability. That group said they would have to close their 

doors, so the government brought a bill to the legislature, 

reduced their taxes, and extended their licence by three years. 

Why would the Sask Party government favour one existing 

racetrack over another, and why would they renew one licence 

for the whole province instead of allowing two home market 

areas licences to share the market? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Crown 

Investments. 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — The decision, Mr. Speaker, was not to 

support one breed of horse racing over another. It also was not 

to support one city over another, Mr. Speaker. The decision was 

to support what has been in place for over a decade now, Mr. 

Speaker. So it was to support, not to change what was already 

in place. 

 

By reviewing the advisement of the three racetracks that I had 

already mentioned, it was reviewing whether or not betting in 

races was increasing or decreasing. It was reviewing the history 

of why the province went to one home market area in the past. 

And the reason why was because they found that two home 

market areas were not viable. 

 

It was looking at other provinces. The province of Alberta 

which has four times our population only has two home market 

areas. They do not have four. Mr. Speaker, it was also looking 

at what would happen if we just took a chance and put 

Prairieland Park at risk. And I will address that in the next 

question. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Nutana. 

 



April 24, 2013 Saskatchewan Hansard 3361 

Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, the operators of West Meadows 

Raceway invested considerable time, money, and land to build 

the facility they believe would create new opportunities in 

harness racing in Regina and beyond. But their dreams are 

crushed when the Sask Party government ignored their work. 

This has disappointed thousands of people who enjoy attending 

races in southern Saskatchewan, as well as those who benefit 

from the economic spinoff of this enterprise. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the West Meadows Raceway operators are not 

asking for support from the government. They’re asking for 

fairness from the government. Why has the Sask Party treated 

the West Meadows Raceway unfairly? Why have they turned 

their back on entrepreneurs looking for fairness and a level 

playing field for their business? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Crown 

Investments. 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, when there was two 

home market areas in the province, the decision was, with those 

operators, was that there was not enough revenue generated to 

support two home market areas. So if we change that now and 

if the revenue dollars from having those home market areas is 

less now than it was then when that decision was made — and 

Praireland Park purchased the assets from Regina exhibition at 

the time; they weren’t just handed those assets, Mr. Speaker — 

we would then be putting Prairieland Park in jeopardy just to 

see if it might work. 

 

And what would we jeopardize, Mr. Speaker? Well 300-plus 

horse owners — over 250 of those are from Saskatchewan; 60 

horse trainers, 50 of which are from Saskatchewan; over 175 

groomers; over 30 year-round staff for the teletheatres. And the 

majority of all those employees that I mentioned are First 

Nations people. Mr. Speaker, we cannot risk that when all of 

the indicators show that we do not have a big enough market to 

support two home market areas. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 

Nutana. 

 

Ms. Sproule: — Mr. Speaker, the minister made a choice to 

ignore the licence application from West Meadows Raceway. 

The minister made a choice to expand the Prairieland Park’s 

licence from one year to three. And the minister made a choice 

to reduce the parimutuel tax at Prairieland Park’s request. As a 

result of those choices, the Sask Party government’s stubborn 

decision will crush the dreams of entrepreneurs in our province. 

Will the minister reconsider her denial of this licence and work 

with the standardbred industry to expand opportunities in our 

province? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Crown 

Investments. 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, in my previous answers, 

I already outlined the reason why we chose to maintain what’s 

been in place for a decade now, Mr. Speaker, within our 

province. And we chose not to make a change. What I’ve 

encouraged the racetrack operators to do is to work with one 

another, perhaps under one licence. And that is indeed already 

happening between Cornerstone in Yorkton and Marquis 

Downs in Saskatoon. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I think that the racetrack operators need to work 

together in order to make a very, very challenging industry 

work. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Rosemont. 

 

Technology Company and University 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, we’ve just received a 

leaked confidential report that shows that the IPAC 

[International Performance Assessment Centre for geologic 

storage of CO2] relationship with CVI [Climate Ventures Inc.] 

was a disaster from the start. You’ll recall, Mr. Speaker, CVI 

was the costly company that that government started up with 

taxpayers’ money in 2008. The report, dated March 28th, 2011, 

shows detailed evidence alleging waste, gouging, and unethical 

behaviour by CVI. 

 

To the minister: why did the Sask Party create CVI with 

taxpayers’ money and then do nothing to clean up the mess that 

they created? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Energy and 

Resources. 

 

Hon. Mr. McMillan: — Mr. Speaker, the member opposite in 

his preamble has some facts somewhat confused. The reality is, 

Mr. Speaker, that the university looked for some funding to find 

out how they could commercialize their research. The Minister 

of the Economy provided some funding for them to do that. A 

report was prepared and the university received that report. The 

university, Mr. Speaker, then either acted on it or did not. I 

think there’s an argument to be made there. But from the 

Government of Saskatchewan’s point of view, we supported the 

university in the business plan and the development. Beyond 

that, Mr. Speaker, the university has acted in that manner. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, the report shows that CVI, 

the company that that government created with taxpayers’ 

money in 2008, used access to high-tech computers and 

software of IPAC to generate more revenue for CVI. 

 

Mr. Speaker, taxpayers’ dollars set up both CVI and IPAC, and 

CVI used taxpayers’ money to purchase expensive, unneeded 

technology assets. Those unneeded assets were used to generate 

profits for a private company. Strangely, that was exactly what 

the Sask Party intended to do with CVI back in 2008, that CVI 

would be a private IT [information technology] contractor. 

 

Mr. Speaker, why was the Sask Party’s pet project, CVI, using 

IPAC’s computers, the unneeded assets that taxpayers paid for 

to generate revenues? And did any of those revenues flow back 

to the province of Saskatchewan? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Energy and 

Resources. 

 



3362 Saskatchewan Hansard April 24, 2013 

Hon. Mr. McMillan: — Again, Mr. Speaker, the member’s 

question is completely off base. And in fact in my first answer I 

referenced that the Ministry of the Economy, Mr. Speaker, 

funded the university to look at how they could commercialize 

their carbon research, not how to develop an IT company. Mr. 

Speaker, that is the facts. 

 

A report was put forward. The research on this was done. The 

university received the report on how they could commercialize 

this carbon research, Mr. Speaker. The company the member 

opposite references is a company that has spun out of the 

university. It is not related to the Government of Saskatchewan. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, that’s unbelievable 

coming from the minister whose order in council authorized 

and created CVI in the first place with taxpayers’ dollars. And 

that company as well, CVI, didn’t just use the assets that were 

unneeded; they also charged outrageous costs. In one contract, 

CVI overcharged taxpayers 171 per cent, Mr. Speaker. The 

report alleges waste, stating that the greatest part of $2.1 

million was for no acceptable business purpose. 

 

That government had three members, government-appointed 

members on the IPAC board, and the Sask Party created CVI 

with taxpayers’ dollars. They controlled all the levers. Mr. 

Speaker, why did the Sask Party government do nothing to 

intervene and stop the outrageous gouging and waste in its 

IPAC affair? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Crown 

Investments. 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, I know that the member 

opposite has been told numerous times that, prior to the board 

being formed, there wasn’t government members that were 

overseeing the expenditures of IPAC. It was indeed under the 

management of the U of R [University of Regina]. 

 

The Meyers Norris Penny forensic audit said this, and I will 

quote, “The assets were purchased with funds that the 

University of Regina controlled on behalf of IPAC.” Further it 

said, and I quote, “Prior to the current IPAC management being 

hired, it appeared that Dr. Wilson and Mr. Bailey were 

responsible for overseeing the operations of IPAC. These 

individuals reported to the VP of research at the University of 

Regina.” Third quote, Mr. Speaker, and I quote, “Financial 

oversight of IPAC was through the university industry liaison 

office.” 

 

When the agency was incorporated, a board was formed. That 

is indeed when CIC [Crown Investments Corporation of 

Saskatchewan] had board members, and actions were 

immediately taken, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, let’s be clear. That 

government created, with taxpayers’ money, CVI that, with all 

the evidence, appears to be little more than a flow-through 

scheme to rip off public dollars. 

 

This report is scathing, that’s in our possession. And it’s been 

in possession of government for two years. It alleges waste; it 

alleges gouging; and it alleges completely unethical behaviour 

by CVI, the private company created by that government with 

taxpayers’ money. Why did that government that created CVI 

not call in the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] to 

investigate all of the alleged wrongdoing and waste in the 

company that it created? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Crown 

Investments. 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, before I continue to give 

quotes from the forensic audit — and there was a forensic audit 

as well as the Provincial Auditor audited the relationship 

between the university and CVI — would we please ask that he 

say who authored the report that he’s reading from, as well as 

table it? 

 

But, Mr. Speaker, another quote that we have is prior to the 

current IPAC management being hired, the individuals reported 

to the VP of research to the University of Regina. Mr. Speaker, 

financial oversight of IPAC was through the university industry 

liaison office. 

 

Mr. Speaker, over and over again, the evidence is very clear 

that the U of R managed the money at the time that this contract 

was entered into. It’s very, very clear that they made . . . that 

there was university individuals that made the decisions to enter 

into that contract. When the board was formed, Mr. Speaker, 

actions were taken. Those actions, we believe, were the 

appropriate actions, which is severing the contract, moving the 

control of the money away from the U of R, having a forensic 

audit done, as well as having an assessment of the assets. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Rosemont. 

 

Mr. Wotherspoon: — Mr. Speaker, as far as tabling the report 

that they’ve had for two years, I certainly will. Who was it 

provided to? It was provided to the board of IPAC, with the 

three government-appointed members on that board, two years 

ago, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Sask Party created CVI with taxpayers’ 

money, something that now seems to appear as nothing more 

than an flow-through scheme to rip off public dollars, Mr. 

Speaker. We recognize through all of the evidence that there’s 

huge risk and allegation of waste into the tune of millions of 

dollars. My question to the minister is: why have the RCMP not 

been called in? And will the government support that call here 

today? 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Crown 

Investments. 

 

[14:15] 

 

Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, our government is very 

committed to exploring possibilities in carbon capture and 

sequestration. We believe it’s good for the industry and good 



April 24, 2013 Saskatchewan Hansard 3363 

for the environment, Mr. Speaker. Is that member suggesting 

that we should not enter into any agreements with the U of R, 

Mr. Speaker? Because quite frankly, that is what he’s implying, 

is that there’s criminal actions that happened under the U of R. 

The U of R has asked the Provincial Auditor to review all of 

their processes, Mr. Speaker. We will see what that report says 

and then the appropriate minister can maybe make a decision. 

 

But quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, if they don’t want us to have 

any management or any agreements in research with the 

University of Regina, he needs to stand up and he needs to say 

that that is the NDP position. Because we do value the research 

abilities of our two universities, Mr. Speaker. And it’s 

unfortunate these individuals time and time again have not 

followed the university’s processes. 

 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 

 

Hon. Mr. Harrison: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In order to 

facilitate the work of committees this afternoon, I move that 

this House do now adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — The Government House Leader has moved 

adjournment of debate. Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to 

adopt the motion? 

 

Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 

 

The Speaker: — Carried. This House stands adjourned to 10 

a.m. tomorrow morning. 

 

[The Assembly adjourned at 14:16.]
