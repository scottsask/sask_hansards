INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’d 
like to introduce through you to the other members of the 
Assembly some representatives of the mining industry in 
Saskatchewan, both from management and labour. And I’d like 
to, in recognition of Saskatchewan Mining Week, Mr. Speaker, 
also ask for leave to say a few words about Saskatchewan 
Mining Week, if I may. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’m pleased to inform the Legislative Assembly 
that May 25 to May 31 — this week — has been proclaimed as 
Saskatchewan Mining Week. This week is a time to salute and 
recognize the significant contribution mining makes to our 
province’s prosperity, to growing our economy, and to creating 
jobs for Saskatchewan people. 
 
Let me begin by asking some guests in your gallery, Mr. 
Speaker, to rise. First of all, from the Saskatchewan Mining 
Association, we have Mr. Norm Beug, who is the president. We 
have Mr. Michael Hogan, who is the second vice-president; Mr. 
Moe Davyduke, who is a member of the executive; Mr. Josef 
Spross, who is the past president; and Mr. Phil Reeves, who is 
the executive director. 
 
And we also have with us Mr. Roy Howell, who is 



May 26, 2003 Saskatchewan Hansard 1211 

 

Occupational Health and Safety Council member, representing 
workers. He is from the United Steelworkers of America, Local 
7689. We have Kelly Reynolds, the Co-Chair of the 
Occupational Health and Safety Committee of the United 
Steelworkers of America, Local 7552; Mr. Gord Gress, United 
Steelworkers of America, Local 7656; Mr. Lorne Wagner, the 
president of the United Mine Workers of America, Local 7606; 
and Lonnie Haux, Chair of the Occupational Health and Safety 
Committee, United Mine Workers of America, Local 7606, 
also. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — So the House has welcomed them and 
thank you for that. 
 
I just wanted to say, Mr. Speaker, if I might, that Saskatchewan 
has many reasons to be proud of the mining industry and the 
people that work within it. We are the third largest non-fuel 
mineral producer in Canada. Approximately 6 per cent of our 
provincial GDP (gross domestic product) is now from mining. 
 
Saskatchewan is unique in Canada for leading international 
production of two very important minerals, uranium and potash. 
We are the world’s largest producer. And today Saskatchewan 
produces 100 per cent of all uranium mined in Canada and over 
a third of the uranium extracted around the world. 
 
Similarly we produce about a third of the world’s potash. We 
also produce a diverse range of other minerals like coal, gold, 
copper, zinc, clay, salt, sodium and potassium sulphates. And 
there are additional potential exploration opportunities for rare 
earth and platinum group metals and especially exciting 
prospects for diamonds, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mining is clearly of great benefit to Saskatchewan’s economy. 
Last year the industry sold $2.4 billion worth of products and 
returned about $250 million in resource royalty and tax 
revenues to the people of our province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the taxes we collect from mining companies help 
fund education, health care, and other important social 
programs across the province. And just as important, our 
mining industry is all about jobs — jobs that benefit towns all 
over Saskatchewan in our rural communities, in the North, and 
for our Aboriginal people. 
 
Mr. Speaker, approximately 20,000 people work directly and 
indirectly in the mining industry. These employees are well 
trained and highly skilled. They receive some of the highest 
industrial wages of any sector, on average $56,000 per year. 
And mining is also one of the safest industries to work in. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan Mining Week goes a long way each 
year to increase public awareness of this very important sector 
of our economy. And so through you, Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all members and indeed everyone in the province to reflect and 
take pride in the contribution mining makes to ensuring a future 
that is wide open for Saskatchewan. And I encourage everyone 
to celebrate Saskatchewan Mining Week from May 25 to May 
31 because, Mr. Speaker, mining is very, very good for 
Saskatchewan. Thank you. 
 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Stewart: — . . . I rise to introduce to you and through you 
to all members of this Hon. Assembly several very important 
men in the mining industry within this province — Norm Beug, 
president of the Saskatchewan Mining Association, Mike 
Hogan, second vice-president of the Saskatchewan Mining 
Association, Moe Davyduke a member of the executive, Josef 
Spross, immediate past president of the Saskatchewan Mining 
Association, and Mr. Phil Reeves, executive director of the 
Saskatchewan Mining Association. I hope you all enjoy your 
visit to this Hon. Assembly and that Mining Week is a great 
success this year. 
 
And also, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce some officials 
from the United Steelworkers and United Mine workers of 
America unions . . . (inaudible) . . . this great industry important 
for Saskatchewan. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to you 
and through you to all the members of our Assembly today, I’d 
like to take this opportunity to introduce 16 grade 12 students 
from the community of Eastend, my home community. And I’m 
so grateful to have these students here today. It’s become 
almost a tradition. 
 
And I was meeting with them earlier, just prior to the session, 
and informed them how important I feel that these visits are by 
various classes throughout the . . . (inaudible) . . . provincial 
constituency at the provincial legislature. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have, with the students, teachers Marie Hanson 
and Shelley Morvik. They’ve been very conscientious about 
teaching the political system to these young people and made 
the arrangements for this particular trip. 
 
And accompanying them, behind the wheel of the bus, is Kurt 
Humphrey, the driver. Now last year you might remember, Mr. 
Speaker, when I introduced Kurt, I said he was the best backhoe 
operator in the province. We’re not going to go there this year. 
I’m just going to say that he’s a very important coffee buddy of 
mine when I’m at home. It’s nice to have Kurt here. 
 
But also on behalf of our Page, Brock Egeto, I’d like to 
introduce two of the students specifically. He has two cousins, 
twins, Stephanie and Shelagh Morris, attending as part of the 
grade 12 class today. On behalf of Brock, I’d like to have them 
stand and introduce them to you specifically this afternoon. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s my pleasure to 
introduce to you and through you to the members of this 
Legislative Assembly, a group of 49 students seated in the 
western gallery. They’re a group of grade 5 and 7 students 
hailing from Walker School, and they’re here with their 
teachers, John Stark and Cheryl Ball. 
 
It’s the third time I’ve had the great opportunity to meet with 
this particular group — a different group of students, of course, 
but the same excellent teachers. So it’s a pleasure to see you up 



1212 Saskatchewan Hansard May 26, 2003 

 

here today in the gallery. I hope you enjoy the proceedings and 
I look forward to meeting with you after the question period. 
Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 

Prince Albert Community Events 
 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. As you will know, Friday night was a pretty busy 
evening in Prince Albert. It was so busy in fact that we had to 
import an extra MLA in to help cover all the events taking place 
that evening. I was very pleased to be present at the grand 
opening of the Prince Albert Arts Centre. You, I understand, 
helped the Minister of Community Resources celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of the Prince Albert Housing Authority — fine 
events, both. 
 
Meanwhile out at the Exhibition Centre about 300 of Prince 
Albert’s finest gathered for the 14th annual YWCA (Young 
Women’s Christian Association ) sponsored Women of 
Distinction awards banquet. As you know this is one evening of 
the year when we recognize the year-long outstanding 
contributions of several women to the business, social, and 
cultural life of our city. But we should also mention it’s a very 
important fundraiser by the Y to support the many programs 
and services, particularly its residence. 
 
There were 14 nominees in five categories. All are winners, but 
the declared winner in each category is: Sheryl Kimbley, in Arts 
and Culture; Peggy Paull, in the Business and Professional 
Women; Ellen Grewcock, in Health, Sport and Fitness; 
Delphine Melchert, for the Community Enhancement; and 
special recognition, as well as the $1,000 Roberta Bondar 
scholarship going to the Young Woman of Distinction, Erica 
Nelson. Erica met Canada’s astronaut, Ms. Bondar, in the 
second grade, a meeting which left a lasting impression on her. 
 
Congratulations to all the winners and nominees, and to the 
organizers. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Mining Week in Saskatchewan 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This is Mining Week 
in Saskatchewan and the Saskatchewan Mining Association has 
a busy week planned, beginning with the launch of Mining 
Week at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum this morning, and 
wrapping up on Saturday with the emergency response and 
mine rescue competition and banquet at Exhibition Park here in 
Regina. 
 
It is very appropriate that this week be set aside annually to 
recognize the contribution that mining makes to Saskatchewan. 
The theme for this year’s mining week is, The Economic 

Impact and Significance of the Mining Industry in 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the economic impact and significance are 
considerable, mining being Saskatchewan’s third-largest 
industry in terms of value of sales, after oil and gas and 
agriculture. The total value of mineral sales in 2002 was over 
$2.4 billion. 
 
The industry spends more than $2 billion annually on wages 
and goods and services. The mining industry pays more than 
$250 million a year in royalties and taxes. The mining industry 
employs 20,000 people directly and the average employee earns 
more than $55,000 annually. 
 
Saskatchewan is the largest producer in the world of both 
potash and uranium, accounting for about one-third of the 
world’s production in both commodities; 63 per cent of the 
province’s power is generated from coal mined in the province. 
 
Mining is one of the safest industries in the province and 
displays a strong social and environmental conscience. 
 
Congratulations to the Saskatchewan Mining Association and to 
the industry, and thank you for the work you do and the huge 
contribution that you make to our province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Communities of Tomorrow Partnership 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — I can see why they wouldn’t want the 
opposition to be heard but why they wouldn’t want me to be 
seen, I don’t understand. 
 
Mr. Speaker, thanks to a five-year, $30 million investment from 
various partners in the New Communities of Tomorrow 
partnership, Regina’s set to be a national centre of excellence 
for work on sustainable communities. 
 
The Communities of Tomorrow partnership will develop, 
demonstrate, and commercialize technologies and management 
practices for sustainable communities. It is a partnership that 
brings together the facilities and capabilities of the NRC — 
which is of course the National Research Council of Canada — 
University of Regina, city of Regina, and it brings it together in 
a unique community environmental laboratory. This will help 
us to test and assess existing and emerging technologies and 
applications for sustainable community development. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this new NRC Centre for Sustainable 
Infrastructure Research is the key to this partnership. The 
research program will serve as a catalyst for the growth of a 
technology cluster in the region that will focus on the theme of 
sustainable infrastructure development. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we believe that the future of Saskatchewan is all 
about change in attitude. For those of us who choose to believe 
in this province, the future is truly wide open. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

Green Ribbon of Hope Month 
 
Ms. Draude: — Today a number of MLAs (Member of the 
Legislative Assembly) are sporting a green ribbon upon their 
lapel. These ribbons, Mr. Speaker, are part of Child Find 
Canada’s Green Ribbon of Hope campaign that ran through the 
month of May. The ribbons are used to draw the public’s 
awareness to the issue of missing children in Canada. 
 
The students and faculty of Holy Cross Secondary School in St. 
Catherines, Ontario started this idea following the abduction 
and horrific murder of their friend, Kristen French. 
 
Every year police departments across this country receive 
thousands of reports of missing children. As was evidenced by 
the abduction and murder of 10-year-old Holly Jones in Toronto 
this year, we are all too aware that not all missing children are 
found alive, if found at all. 
 
Child Find is dedicated to both the education of parents and 
guardians to ensure their children are kept safe, as well as the 
return of missing children to their rightful guardians. I would 
hope all members of our community wear this ribbon as a sign 
of their support and concern for this issue. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Gordon Tootoosis Honoured at Yorkton Film Festival 
 
Mr. Goulet: — Mr. Speaker, Otuyumiw, the Alliance of 
Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Arts honoured Gordon 
Tootoosis with an ACTRA Award of Excellence at the Yorkton 
Film Festival over the weekend. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Gordon Tootoosis was raised on the Poundmaker 
First Nation in a home where he was taught that pride in one’s 
culture was of special significance. Pride and respect had to be 
an integral part of one’s life. Like his father, the late John 
Tootoosis, it meant standing up for one’s beliefs in all areas, 
including the political. 
 
Mr. Tootoosis began his acting career in Toronto in the late 
’60s as part of the emerging Canadian theatre movement. His 
first film role was as Almighty Voice in a movie called Alien 
Thunder and since then he has played in more than 40 films and 
television shows. He has played good guys, bad guys, historical 
figures, a puppet, a cartoon character, and a ghost. He is 
probably best known for his portrayal of the villainous Albert 
Golo in the TV show North of 60, although Saskatchewan 
Indians will likely remember him best as Big Bear in the film of 
the same name. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Gordon Tootoosis is an outstanding performer, an 
excellent ambassador for the province, and a worthy role model 
for all Saskatchewan people, no matter what their background. I 
ask all my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. 
Tootoosis, not only on receiving this ACTRA Award of 
Excellence, but for all his achievements. 
 
(The hon. member spoke for a time in Cree.) 
 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Prince Albert Women of Distinction Awards 
 
Mr. Wiberg: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 600 
people including myself attended the 14th annual Women of 
Distinction Awards banquet held in Prince Albert on Friday 
evening, May 23. 
 
This gala event at the Prince Albert Exhibition Centre affords 
the people of Prince Albert and district the opportunity to 
recognize women who have gone above and beyond to make 
our community a better place to live. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the YWCA (Young Women’s Christian 
Association) host this annual event and again the evening was a 
highly successful celebration for the Y. 
 
The guest speaker was Gail Bowen, a professor at the 
Saskatchewan Indian Federated College and author of several 
books and plays. As enthralling a speaker as Ms. Bowen is, Mr. 
Speaker, the 14 nominees held the spotlight. And I would like 
to inform the Assembly of five of these women. 
 
The first honouree was Erica Nelson, a grade 12 student. Erica 
received the SaskPower/Roberta Bondar Young Woman of 
Distinction Award for excellence in education and community 
participation. Sheryl Kimbley was honoured for her 
participation and promotion of arts and culture. Sheryl will 
produce this year’s Noises of the North Youth Showcase. Peggy 
Paull, a realtor in Prince Albert and former office manager for a 
Member of Parliament, Stan Hovdebo, was honoured in the 
business and professional category. Delphine Melchert was 
recognized in the community enhancement category for her role 
in helping those less fortunate than others. Finally, Ellen 
Grewcock was honoured in the health, sport and fitness 
category as a participant, coach and official. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all members please join me in 
congratulating these five recipients. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

John MacLeod Retires 
 
Mr. Harper: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, last 
Thursday, May 22, I and a number of my colleagues joined a 
group of men and women getting together to honour a man for 
his lifelong commitment and tireless dedication to protecting 
the rights of working men and women of our province. The 
occasion was the retirement celebration of John MacLeod. 
 
Mr. Speaker, John MacLeod had a long and productive career. 
From 1993 to 2002 John served as the business manager of the 
Saskatchewan Provincial Building Trades Council. Previous to 
that, for over 25 years, he was the business manager for the 
Local 2038 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers. And during his tenure with IBEW John also managed 
to find time to serve as president of the Saskatchewan 
Federation of Labour. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’ve had the good fortune of knowing John for a 
long time and I look forward to knowing him for a long time 



1214 Saskatchewan Hansard May 26, 2003 

 

yet. And I have to say that rarely, rarely have I met a individual 
more dedicated to the trade union movement or to the cause of 
building a better society. 
 
I know all of my government colleagues will want to join me in 
wishing John and his wife, Kathy, all the best in their retirement 
and in saying, congratulations John — congratulations and 
thank you for a job well done. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Members, before we proceed any further, I 
would just ask the House leaders to come forward for 
consultation. 
 
Due to technical difficulties the Assembly recessed for a 
period of time. 
 
The Assembly adjourned at 15:31 p.m.
