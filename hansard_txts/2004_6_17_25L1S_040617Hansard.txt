INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s a great 
pleasure today to introduce to you and through you to all 
members of the legislature, a number of people who are here 
today to be present when we pass The Tobacco Control 
Amendment Act. I’d ask them to stand as I introduce them. 
 
Lynn Greaves, Saskatchewan Coalition for Tobacco Reduction; 
Dr. Tania Diener, Regina Qu’Appelle Health Region; Dolores 
Herring, volunteer president, Canadian Cancer Society, 
Saskatchewan division; Dr. Thakre, chairperson of the medical 
affairs committee of the Canadian Cancer Society, 
Saskatchewan division; Keith Karasin, also of the Canadian 
Cancer Society, executive director; Andrew Caswell, the 
communications director from the Canadian Cancer Society; 
and Donna Pasiechnik, the tobacco control coordinator, 
Canadian Cancer Society, Saskatchewan division. 
 
Paul van Loon, vice-president of health education for the Lung 
Association of Saskatchewan; Jim and Marj Burnett — Jim is 
the past Chair and current board member of the Lung 
Association of Saskatchewan — Gwen Gordon, health 
promotion director, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of 
Saskatchewan; Rhae Ann Bromley, communications director, 
Heart and Stroke Foundation of Saskatchewan; Jordana Ball, 
regional director, southern Saskatchewan, the Canadian

Stuart North, People for Smoke Free Places from Prince Albert; 
Dot Hicks, People for Smoke Free Places, Moose Jaw; and 
Tanya Mengel, health promotion consultant for Saskatchewan 
Health. 
 
I’d like all members of the Assembly to welcome them here and 
to thank them for their work. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the opposition Health critic, the 
member from Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On behalf of the 
official opposition I would like to join with the minister in 
welcoming all the guests in the gallery this afternoon. I would 
also, in welcoming them, extend our appreciation for the very 
dedicated work that they’ve extended in regard to making the 
Saskatchewan environment a healthier place for all of our 
citizens and for future generations. 
 
And I would also like to acknowledge and extend our 
appreciation for the thank you they extended to us on the steps 
of the legislature for this important legislation at 12:30 this 
afternoon. The balloon I’ve got just barely fits into my office. 
But thank you very much. It will be a great souvenir and it’s 
filled with something other than hot air, which is different for 
this legislature. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 

Coronation Park. 
 
Mr. Trew: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my great honour 
today to introduce to you and through you to all members of 
this Chamber, 21 grade 6 students seated in the west gallery. 
These students are from Imperial School in the constituency of 
Regina Coronation Park. Their teacher, Mrs. Malley, is with 
them as well as chaperone, Mrs. Joanne Kennedy and her 
daughter, Melissa Lee. 
 
Today feels a bit like the last day of school for us; for Mrs. 
Malley, it’s getting closer and closer, as at the end of this year 
Mrs. Malley is going to retire after 24 years teaching with a 
13-year break in the middle of it to raise her son and daughter. 
Members of the Chamber, many of you will know Erin Malley, 
having been a guide here in 2000, and Mrs. Malley’s son, Ryan 
— Ryan give us a wave — Ryan Malley is a guide this year, 
this session. So both Mrs. Malley’s daughter and son have been 
guides at their respective times. 
 
I’ve met with this school group. We’ve had the picture. We’ve 
had the full meal deal. They were out on the steps when the 
balloons were presented to MLAs (Member of the Legislative 
Assembly). I don’t know how we can top it, Mr. Speaker, but it 
is indeed fortuitous that this group got here when they did. I 
want to welcome them, and ask members to welcome them and 
to wish Mrs. Malley the very, very best in her retirement and 
travel plans in that. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Swift Current. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you. Mr. Speaker, it’s a pleasure to 
introduce to you and through you to the members of this 
Assembly, seated in your gallery, someone that’s been a great 
help to me. Crystal Martens is helping us out in our 
constituency office in Swift Current on a part-time basis. She of 
course is from the great city of Swift Current, and she is joined 
today by her mother, Nancy. And I’d just ask all members to 
join with me in welcoming her here to her Legislative 
Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Meewasin. 
 
(14:00) 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, earlier today the Minister 
of Corrections and Public Safety and I had the honour and 
pleasure of participating in a signing ceremony with elders from 
around the province of Saskatchewan. I will say more about that 
later, but I would like to take this opportunity to introduce to 
you and through you to all members of the Assembly some 
individuals in the east gallery who participated in that 
ceremony. 
 
With us today is Velma Goodfeather, who is a Dakota elder 
from Standing Buffalo First Nation. And Velma is very active 
in justice issues. She provides counselling to inmates 
incarcerated in the federal system, and advocates for inmates in 



June 17, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1683 

provincial corrections and on parole. With her are members of 
her family: Leanne Goodfeather and Any Goodfeather; as well 
as Jasmine Crant, who is related to another one of the elders 
who was at the ceremonies today, and Joe O’Watch, who is an 
elder’s helper. 
 
Joe is from the Carry the Kettle First Nation. He is the elder’s 
helper for the south, and has been very committed . . . 
(inaudible interjection) . . . have they moved? They were in the 
east gallery. They are now in the west gallery, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
O’Watch is from the Carry the Kettle First Nation. He is the 
elder’s helper for the south, and has been very committed to the 
process of setting up the elders’ advisory committee. Joe was 
chief for eight years I understand, and currently a counsellor for 
Carry the Kettle First Nation. 
 
And I wish that all members will join me in welcoming the 
guests in the west gallery to this legislature. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s a pleasure 
once again to you and through you to introduce a delegation 
seated in your gallery from the United Empire Loyalists. You 
can see some of the members have colourful costumes on, and 
it’s wonderful to have them here again today. 
 
I have enjoyed receiving their correspondence on a regular 
basis; myself am a descendent of loyalists, and I have spent 
time in loyalist homes in other parts of the world, specifically in 
the Barbados. So it’s a wonderful thing to see this celebration, 
and keeping the British history in our country alive. And God 
save the Queen, and welcome. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Wascana 
Plains. 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It’s my pleasure to 
introduce to you and through you to all members of the 
Assembly, 26 grade 4 students from Jack MacKenzie School. 
They’re seated in your gallery, Mr. Speaker, on the east side. 
And they are accompanied this afternoon by Ms. Joanne Patron. 
Also, many chaperons are here today, so I hope I am able to 
pronounce the names correctly: Shona Opdahl, Stan Harder, 
Tracey Turnbull, Jay Palani, Barb Gottselig, Shannon Kulbida, 
and Brett Delgaty. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I’ve been present at the groundbreaking 
ceremonies for the new school, Jack MacKenzie. It’s a joint-use 
school with Gabriel School — St. Gabriel — and also there for 
the ribbon-cutting ceremony and was warmly welcomed by all 
of the students there. I had the chance to view the school and 
hope to be able to return some of the warm hospitality this 
afternoon. 
 
I’m sure they’ll understand that they’ve been here for some 
historic legislation and we’ll be able to speak with them after 
question period. 
 

I’d ask all members to join me in welcoming the grade 4 
students and teacher and chaperones from Jack MacKenzie 
School. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Through you to all 
the members of the Assembly, I would like to ask you to join in 
welcoming 32 grade 6 students from Brunswick School in 
Melfort, Saskatchewan. 
 
They’re here this afternoon with their teachers, Mrs. Neher, 
Mrs. Martin, and Mr. Strass. And I really appreciate their 
dedication in coming yearly to their legislature to witness the 
proceedings and to have a day in their capital city. And I’d like 
to ask all members to join me in welcoming them to Regina and 
their Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. If 
I catch her before she leaves the room, I also want to recognize 
from Jack MacKenzie School, Joanne Patron. Do you want to 
give us a wave? She’s one of my drumming buddies from 
around town, and they have a drum circle at their school. And 
I’ve heard they’re very good so I’m looking forward to hearing 
them sometime so . . . 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Yes, we could have had a drum roll for 
that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Well today I’m welcoming 27 students in grade 4 who are in 
the west gallery — give me a wave — from St. Josaphat 
School. And this is such a popular group of students that the 
member from Walsh Acres and myself were having an 
argument over who would get to introduce them because 
they’re very close to the dividing line between our two 
constituencies. 
 
So I just want to say welcome to the legislature to recognize 
teacher Mrs. Elaine Pack, bus driver Elvin Mandziak, and to say 
that I’ll meet you for pictures later. And thank you very much 
for coming to the legislature today. 
 
Will you join me in welcoming them? 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Yorkton. 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. This 
afternoon I’d like to recognize in your gallery, Mr. Speaker, the 
Lodge family. They’re from Doncaster, England, Mr. Speaker, 
and they’re here for the Farm Progress Show. 
 
And I might just ask them to give a bit of a wave as I introduce 
them: father, Phil, Susanna, Johnathon, and Mathew. They’re 



1684 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

here, as I said a moment ago, at the Farm Progress Show. 
Susanna is going in to study agriculture in Doncaster as well as 
Johnathon who is currently working for the immigration 
department with local government. And Mathew already has his 
degree in agriculture. 
 
This is their first trip here, but Phil has been here now 11 times. 
This is his eleventh trip to Canada. He is staying in Moose Jaw 
tonight, going on tomorrow to Boissevain, and back to Calgary 
on the 28th. And it was interesting that he did know where 
Yorkton, Saskatchewan was, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And on the last trip that Phil was here he purchased a Chevy 
half-ton. And he had the half-ton returned to Doncaster to his 
farm. And he left, he said, the steering on the left-hand side as 
opposed to changing it to the right-hand side because his 
preference — as it is for us — to steer from the left, Mr. 
Speaker. So I want to welcome them to Saskatchewan and to 
enjoy farm progress and see you back in our province in the 
next little while. Thank you very much. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier, the member for 
Saskatoon Riversdale. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And I suspect 
finally I would like to introduce to members of the legislature a 
young woman who today is providing for me a bit of a job 
shadow. Her name is Adriana Mercado Rocha, she is from 
Mexico, she has spent this last year here in the city of Regina at 
the University of Regina studying English. She is a graduate 
lawyer, and has worked with a Mexican senator. 
 
And I’m very pleased to welcome Adriana both to our city, our 
province, and to the legislature. And we wish her well in her 
continuing experience here and her work that will continue in 
Mexico. 
 
And finally, Mr. Speaker, accompanying Adriana today are 
three individuals, Mr. Murray Manz, Mr. Rob Cunningham, and 
Mr. Gordon Nystuen who have provided for myself some 
invaluable advice and guidance over the course of this session. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 

National Aboriginal Day — June 21 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. June 21 is National 
Aboriginal Day across Canada, a day set aside to recognize the 
unique heritage, rich culture, and many contributions of 
Canada’s First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people. In setting aside 
this day, it gives Canadians the opportunity to experience and 
learn more about Aboriginal history, customs, and traditions 
and how they’ve contributed to the development and progress 
of our country. In doing so, Mr. Speaker, it is hoped that all of 
us will achieve greater understanding and appreciation of 
Aboriginal history. We know that understanding leads to 

knowledge, knowledge leads to respect, and respect leads to 
acceptance. Acceptance, Mr. Speaker, leads to co-operation, 
harmony, and insight into the needs of others. 
 
Mr. Speaker, of all the provinces and territories that will be 
honouring our Aboriginal people, I’m sure I speak for all 
members of the House when I say that no province could be 
prouder of its many Aboriginal connections and contributions 
than Saskatchewan. Our province has a proud and honourable 
history with significant Aboriginal ties. 
 
We know that before the settlement of the West, Saskatchewan 
was and still is home to many Aboriginal people of First 
Nations and Métis descent. We are grateful for their many 
contributions to our way of life here on the prairies, and we 
look forward to a future of co-operation, partnership, and 
success. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to recognize next Monday, June 
21, as National Aboriginal Day in Canada, with special 
recognition going out to all Aboriginal people who call 
Saskatchewan home. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cumberland. 
 

Future Bright for First Nations and Métis People 
 
Hon. Ms. Beatty: — Mr. Speaker, Monday, June 21 is National 
Aboriginal Day. Events will be taking place throughout 
Saskatchewan and Canada to recognize and honour the 
contributions of First Nations and Métis people. 
 
Aboriginal people play an important role in the social, 
economic, cultural, and spiritual life of Saskatchewan. And 
given that the Aboriginal population is young and growing, they 
will play an even greater role in the future. Our government is 
working with the Aboriginal community to ensure this happens. 
 
Mr. Speaker, through programs like SchoolPLUS, through 
institutions like the First Nations University of Canada and the 
Gabriel Dumont Institute, more and more Aboriginal youth are 
graduating from post-secondary schools than ever before. The 
Aboriginal Employment Development Program is opening 
doors for employment opportunities for First Nations and Métis 
people. 
 
More than 50 agreements have been signed with various 
companies and organizations, resulting in more than 1,700 
Aboriginal people being hired. Over 900 more have completed 
training directly linked to jobs. Today a major partnership with 
the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce was signed which 
will result in even more jobs and business opportunities for 
Aboriginal people. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan has a very bright future which, in 
significant ways, is tied to the future of the First Nations and 
Métis community. I invite everyone to take the opportunity to 
celebrate that bright future by taking part in National Aboriginal 
Day festivities on June 21. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Melfort. 
 

Legislative Internship Program 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, as we come to a close of the 
spring sitting of the legislature, I want to take this opportunity 
to once again acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the 
four individuals who took part in the legislative internship 
program this year. 
 
While they will be with us until the end of July, I want to take 
time to thank them for the work they have done during this very 
busy session. During the second term of this year’s program, 
I’ve had the opportunity to work with Ryan Griffiths, while the 
member from Canora-Pelly worked with Joanne 
Harpauer-Dignean. I also want to thank once again, Fabian 
Contreras and Kim McKechney, who have been with the 
government side this term and who were with us early in the 
year. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the internship program has once again shown its 
value. During the first three years it has been in place, it has 
given some of the brightest students in our province a 
tremendous learning experience. Thanks of course goes to 
Gordon Barnhart, who has been the driving force of this 
program. 
 
I understand funding has been secured to allow this program to 
continue past this year, and it is the hope of the Saskatchewan 
Party caucus and I’m sure all MLAs that it continues every year 
thereafter. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Regina-Qu’Appelle Valley. 
 

June 19 Designated United Empire Loyalists Day 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
over 200 years ago, in the wake of the revolution that saw 
America gain its independence from Britain, some 70,000 
American colonists loyal to the Crown fled their homes and 
resettled in Canada. I am thankful to say that the Wartman 
family was a part of that movement. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this group of refugees, now known as the United 
Empire Loyalists, arrived in their new home with little in the 
way of worldly possessions. What they did have was a clear 
idea of the kind of country in which they wanted to live. 
 
It isn’t surprising therefore that they had a significant impact on 
the development of Eastern Canada, especially in terms of 
language and the types of governmental and judicial institutions 
that were put in place. Years later when Western Canada was 
open for homesteading, many of the first settlers were of United 
Empire Loyalist stock, and they brought with them many of the 
values, traditions and institutions that have helped shaped 
Saskatchewan and the other provinces here in the West. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the considerable social and 
cultural contributions that the loyalists and their descendants 
have made to this province, Saskatchewan has designated June 
19 as United Empire Loyalist Day. And, Mr. Speaker, to honour 
this part of Saskatchewan’s heritage, the Regina branch of the 

United Empire Loyalists Association plans to erect a cairn made 
out of fieldstones from the homesteads of Loyalist pioneers, to 
be in place for Saskatchewan’s centennial next year. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask all members who are of that United 
Empire Loyalist stock to join me in standing, and I ask all 
others to join those of us who are standing in welcoming the 
members of the United Empire Loyalists and their descendants 
here into the legislature today. So those who are of United 
Empire Loyalist stock, if they would stand . . .  
 
(14:15) 
 
The Speaker: — Would the members give leave for the 
member’s applause? Please grant . . . (inaudible) . . . Please rise. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — We have leave, if you would like to 
stand and join me. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 

Celebrating 77 Years of Marriage 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This weekend, a 
milestone anniversary will be marked in the community of Gull 
Lake. Norman and Elsie Beaumont and several members of 
their family will gather at the Kiaskus Villa to celebrate their 
77th anniversary. That’s right, Mr. Speaker, 77 years of marital 
bliss. 
 
It’s unconfirmed, but one of the Beaumont’s grandsons had 
surfed the Internet and indicates that the Beaumonts may be in 
fact be the longest-married couple in Canada at this present 
time. 
 
Two years ago, this amazing pair moved to a privately operated 
care home because it’s close to their daughter’s home in the 
community of Swift Current, and it was the one facility they 
could find that allows couples to share a room. 
 
While farming in the Hanley district, the Beaumonts raised four 
children. Now they boast about their 12 grandchildren, and their 
19 great-grandchildren. They moved into town, Mr. Speaker, 50 
years ago. And Norm continued to farm until the big machines 
arrived. 
 
This spring Norman fell and broke a hip, survived pneumonia, 
and is now in a wheelchair. But otherwise, Mr. Speaker, both he 
and Elsie are in wonderful health. Elsie celebrated her 99th 
birthday in March, and plans are in the works for Norman’s 
99th birthday this September. 
 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating this couple as 
their family gathers to celebrate 77 years of marriage for this 
couple. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 
Elphinstone-Centre. 
 



1686 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

Regina Squids Win Senior National Championship 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Regina Squids water 
polo has captured yet another national title. 
 
Earlier this month in Montreal, the Squids won the 2004 Speedo 
Senior Men’s Tier II National Club Championships. The Squids 
went undefeated throughout the tournament, outscoring their 
competitors 43 to 23. In the gold medal game, the Squids 
defeated the Ottawa Titans with a score of 11 to 8. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in addition to the victory, the Squids crowned the 
oldest national water polo champion in Canadian history as 
team captain Nigel Crook is 47 years old. He has played the 
sport since 1969, which makes for a whopping 35 years of 
experience and one heck of a lot of swimming. Crook also got 
the Squids off to a good start when he scored the team’s first 
goal in the tournament. 
 
The other members of the Regina Squids senior men’s 
championship team are Robin Randall, Mark Smorong, Georges 
Mensink, Justin Beitel, Mike Brough, Marshall Young, Wes 
Godbeer, Rob Barber, Symon Honeyborne, Petros Aiginitis, 
and Noah Miller. Miller and Aiginitis were also named to the 
tournament all-star team, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And hot on the heels of being named the Most Valuable Coach 
at the National Young Men’s Canadian Water Polo 
Championship, which was won by a younger squad of Squids in 
May, team coach, Mike Mortin, was once again named Most 
Valuable Coach, an outstanding achievement. 
 
The Squids’ home pool is the Lawson Aquatic Centre located 
right in the heart of Regina Elphinstone-Centre. I am proud to 
say that yet another Water Polo Canada National Championship 
banner will be hanging on the eastern wall at the Lawson. And 
if the Squids keep racking up championships like this, Mr. 
Speaker, the Lawson will need a larger wall. I ask all my 
colleagues to join me in congratulating The Regina Squids on 
yet another impressive victory. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Biggar. 
 

Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. We know the treaties 
signed more than a century ago allow for the settlement of our 
great province. Development was the direct result of a targeted 
western population increase made possible through 
immigration. One hundred years later, Mr. Speaker, we are once 
again looking to the immigrant sector for their help in securing 
our province’s future. 
 
We know we have a young and growing Aboriginal population, 
but we also know that it will not be enough to address our 
looming labour shortage. The province desperately needs more 
people, and we are encouraged by our government’s recent 
move to increase the numbers in the Saskatchewan immigrant 
nominee program from 200 to 300. But this isn’t enough, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 

A recent Canada West Foundation study on provincial nominee 
programs found that Saskatchewan is lagging behind other 
provinces in a number of areas. For example Manitoba has 
formed some unique agreements that attract immigrants to 
certain communities. We wonder if it’s possible that similar 
agreements might be adapted for use here in Saskatchewan. The 
province also needs to do more to attract immigrants with 
economic bases, as it is this group that can significantly 
contribute to our economic sector. Again, Mr. Speaker, in 
comparison with other provinces, Saskatchewan is behind 
Manitoba, Alberta, and BC (British Columbia). 
 
By identifying the skilled labour shortages in the various 
sectors, removing the barriers that are limiting growth and 
development, and putting in place a solid plan for the future, we 
know that Saskatchewan can become a top destination for 
immigrants. Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, much more must be 
done. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Government Spending Priorities 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well today 
on the last day of the session, we see another clear example, the 
latest example, of the Premier’s priorities, of the NDP 
government’s priorities for the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
The same Premier who has announced that this government will 
be closing long-term care beds and closing hospital facilities, 
who claims to be unable to keep his own election promises 
because they have no resources, the government hasn’t the 
resources, that same Premier and that same government, Mr. 
Speaker, we know today has decided that what we really need 
in Saskatchewan is three brand new Liquor Board stores, Mr. 
Speaker. In my hometown of Swift Current and in Kindersley 
and in Estevan, they are about to spend $3.3 million on new 
Liquor Board store buildings. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the question to the Premier is this: why is the 
Premier closing long-term care beds and hospitals and building 
Liquor Board stores? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, it has been the plan of the 
Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority to build these new 
stores in these communities to better serve customers. 
 
But those communities, Mr. Speaker, are represented by the 
Leader of the Opposition in the case of Swift Current, and 
others. And I respect the views of the members opposite and if 
it is their position that those stores ought not to be built in those 
communities, I’m prepared to consult with those members and 
with those communities and to revise our plans in that regard. 
And I will be pleased to meet with the Leader of the Opposition 
to discuss the fact that perhaps we shouldn’t be building those 
stores in those communities, Mr. Speaker. 



June 17, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1687 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely positive that the 
people of Swift Current and of Kindersley and of Estevan could 
think of hundreds of things more worthwhile for public 
resources than a new Liquor Board store, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — I don’t mind standing in this . . . I don’t mind 
standing here or anywhere else and saying that in Swift Current 
the priority is the new regional hospital, whose funding is in 
jeopardy, Mr. Speaker, because of closures. 
 
I don’t mind standing in this legislature and saying that in Swift 
Current the priority is for a sewage treatment plant or maybe a 
performing arts centre, and that we’ll hear more about the 
priorities of other centres. 
 
The question, Mr. Speaker, is what is . . . what are the priorities 
of this Premier and will he stand on his feet today and explain 
to the people of the province why he hasn’t the money to keep 
his own promises but he’s prepared to spend millions on new 
Liquor Board stores in Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, as minister in charge of the 
Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority, I am prepared, 
subject to any contractual rights that people may have that 
we’ve entered into agreements, to cancel the construction of 
liquor stores in those three communities. This government is 
prepared to do that. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that where 
money goes in government is set by the budget and in this 
budget the Minister of Finance stood up and said that $173 
million new money was being dedicated to the health system 
and $18 million more money was being dedicated to the K to 12 
(kindergarten to grade 12) system. And in both of those cases, 
Mr. Speaker, those members did not support new funding for 
health and education, Mr. Speaker. 
 
There was also $10 million new money for municipal 
government, Mr. Speaker, and those members did not support 
that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
But we will respect what the opposition says and if they don’t 
want new liquor stores, Mr. Speaker, that decision will be 
respected. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, I hope the Premier stands on his feet 
and explains to the people of the province his priorities for 
Saskatchewan. 

The NDP’s decision to cut back hours at the Climax health 
centre, Mr. Speaker, is going to put pressure on Swift Current, 
the hospital. Their decision to close down the Herbert hospital 
will put pressure on the Swift Current hospital. In fact 
municipalities all over southwest Saskatchewan are now 
considering withdrawing their financial support to the new 
regional hospital because of the cuts, because of the loss of 
services in the rural areas. That will leave the residents of Swift 
Current paying more than the $100 per year levy that they’re 
already going to have to pay for their share of the hospital. 
 
So I say to the Premier this, through you, Mr. Speaker: if 
they’ve got $1.2 million to spend in Swift Current — because 
that’s the cost of a new Liquor Board store — if they’ve got it, 
we on this side of the House say, invest it in health care. Will 
the Premier stand and commit to that today? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, one thing that we will do on 
this side of the House is that we will respect the wishes of the 
people of this province and we will build the Cypress regional 
hospital in Swift Current because that’s part of our 
Saskatchewan Action Plan for Health Care. And we’re going to 
continue on that plan working with the people in that particular 
area. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the resources to do that particular project come 
from the budget. They come from the $173 million that 
increases the amount that we have in our health budget this 
year. It also goes to provide the services right across this 
province. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, we do that in an orderly, balanced way in 
our budgeting process. I urge the member opposite to support 
the budget, support what we’re doing because that’s what 
Saskatchewan people want. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, do you know what I think 
Saskatchewan people want? I think Saskatchewan people want 
a government that has their priorities right, Mr. Speaker. That’s 
what they want. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in the most recent local budget in Swift Current, 
the municipality had to budget 14.35 . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order, please. 
 
I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — In the last local budget, the municipality, the 
taxpayers of Swift Current had to budget about $14 million for 
a new sewage treatment plant. I am sure that they would say to 
this government that if this government’s got a million two to 
spend on a new Liquor Board store in the city of Swift Current, 
they would rather it be spent on the treatment of sewage and on 
infrastructure in Swift Current and across this province. 



1688 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

Again, to the Premier: will he explain to Saskatchewan people 
his priority that would put Liquor Board stores, new Liquor 
Board buildings, ahead of health care or ahead of keeping his 
promises? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
speak about the priorities of this government, and they are 
reflected in the current budget which is under debate in this 
House. A priority which says the number one funding priority 
for this government is health care — $2.7 billion in health care 
funding; 173 million new dollars in funding for health care. 
That’s the number one priority. 
 
Following close behind, Mr. Speaker, following close behind in 
terms of the expenditures of this government — education, 
where we’ve seen again in this budget increases; where we see 
increases to revenue sharing; where we’ve seen an increase in 
this year to support the Department of Agriculture; where we 
are maintaining our budgetary commitments to the rebuilding 
and maintenance of the highway infrastructure program in this 
province. 
 
Those are the priorities of spending, Mr. Speaker. They are 
plain to anyone; they are plain to the people of Saskatchewan. 
And they are priorities welcomed by the people of 
Saskatchewan because they reflect the priorities of those same 
citizens. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Premier. 
As a result of the NDP’s (New Democratic Party) disastrous 
budget, ambulances in my constituency of Kindersley are being 
cut so the NDP can save money. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the NDP has decided to cut the ambulance 
services in the communities of Dodsland, Luseland, and my 
hometown of Eatonia. And the NDP says those cuts will save a 
total of $200,000 a year. And today we find out how the 
Premier is going to spend that money, the money cut from 
community ambulance services. He’s going to use it to build a 
new liquor store in Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s a matter of priorities. Why is the NDP 
government cutting ambulance services in the constituency of 
Kindersley to save $200,000 a year and then using that money 
to build $900,000 brand new liquor store in the town of 
Kindersley? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
(14:30) 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the Heartland Health Region 
has been going out to communities to talk about how to provide 

emergency services across that whole area. And they have 
entered into discussions with different communities about what 
are the kinds of services that are there. But they have not made 
those decisions yet. They’re working on that because they need 
to talk to those people in those particular areas. 
 
Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we have set forward an 
Action Plan for Saskatchewan Health Care; we’ve every year 
now put more money into that particular plan. And we’re 
moving forward to provide good health care for Saskatchewan 
people. And we’re going to continue to do that. We’re going to 
put another, a new CT (computerized tomography) scan into the 
Swift Current area. We’re going to provide more services out 
into the western part of the province. We’re going to provide 
more services in the North. We built a new hospital in Fort 
Qu’Appelle. Mr. Speaker, we’re working on issues all over the 
province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Well, Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
Saskatchewan Party reminded the Premier about how badly his 
NDP government has managed health care in Saskatchewan, 
and all the Premier could do was respond by begging the 
Saskatchewan to show the NDP how to solve the problems that 
this Premier has created. In fact, the Premier said, and I quote, 
“. . . not once during . . . this session have they spoken to a 
health policy initiative they would support.” 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, here is a suggestion for the Premier to 
consider. Here’s a policy the Saskatchewan Party would 
support. How about scrapping the NDP’s plan to spend 
$900,000 building new liquor stores in Kindersley, and use the 
money to maintain the ambulances in the communities of 
Luseland, Eatonia, and Dodsland? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I think the information now 
on the record is very clear. And the minister in charge of the 
Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming will be taking the 
appropriate action. Mr. Speaker, I urge that member specifically 
to make sure that he shows up at the next vote when the budget 
comes, because we want all of those members opposite to vote 
for this budget. It’s about health care, in the same way that the 
tobacco reduction Act and all of the work around tobacco was 
about health care. Mr. Speaker, we’re going to continue . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order, please. I 
recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we 
know where we’re going, we know what we need to do, and 
we’re going to continue on that basis. We will be consistent in 
what we’re working at. We will work hard for the people of 
Saskatchewan. And we’ll do that for the next three or four 
years. And then we’ll go to the people and they’ll tell us, go and 
spend another four years serving Saskatchewan people. 
 



June 17, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1689 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Premier told the House while speaking about 
health care and I quote, “. . . we do our very best to take the 
corrective steps. That’s what we’ve been doing.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, here’s an example of the Premier’s best. First he 
cuts ambulances in the communities of Dodsland, Eatonia, and 
Luseland to save $200,000. And then the Premier decides to 
spend $900,000 to build a new liquor store in the town of 
Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that’s the Premier’s best and that is entirely the 
problem. Does the Premier really believe it’s more important to 
sell booze out of a fancy new liquor store than it is to ensure 
ambulances are maintained in our rural communities? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Mr. Speaker, it’s time for the Premier to do 
the right thing. Will he cancel the NDP’s plan to spend 
$900,000 on a new liquor store in Kindersley and use that 
money to maintain ambulance services for families in the 
communities of Dodsland, Luseland, and Eatonia? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, as I’ve already 
indicated to the House, we’re going to be consulting with that 
member’s community. We will be consulting with the mayor of 
Kindersley, the town council of Kindersley, and the business 
community in Kindersley to see if they want the liquor store to 
be cancelled. And, Mr. Speaker, there is a very good chance 
that if that’s what . . . if the member speaks for the community, 
that the liquor store will be cancelled. 
 
But I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that we should not forget that if 
those members, including the member chirping from his seat 
from Kindersley, had had his way in the last provincial election 
we wouldn’t be having this debate, because it was the policy of 
the then leader of the opposition — and it still apparently is 
their policy — to sell off the Liquor Board stores of the people 
of Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that we should never forget that 
that is the real agenda of that party — to sell off the assets of 
the people to their rich friends. And we’ll never let it happen, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Estevan. 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, all 
session the Premier has asked members on this side of the 
House for ideas about . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Member for Estevan. 
 

Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, all 
session the Premier has asked members on this side of the 
House for ideas about how we would spend money. The people 
of Estevan have a number of priorities as far as things they 
would like to see this NDP government accomplish. And some 
of these priorities definitely rank higher than a brand new liquor 
store. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, I find it a little odd that the government has 
$1.2 million for a new Liquor Board, or a new liquor store in 
the city of Estevan, and yet the people of Estevan continue to 
wait for this government to hire staff to operate a dialysis 
machine. While the funding is in place for the equipment, the 
health region needs the province to come through to ensure 
there are professionals to operate the machine. Mr. Speaker, 
why would this government choose to invest in Estevan by 
building a new liquor store when the people in Estevan and 
surrounding areas would benefit more from additional health 
care professionals? To the Premier: where are his government’s 
priorities? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to that 
member and to the House that my answer to the member from 
Estevan is the same as my answer to the member from 
Kindersley, and I have a great deal of respect for both of them. 
And that is that we will take her up on her suggestion and 
consult with the city of Estevan and its officials and its business 
community. 
 
But I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that there is, each and every 
year in the budget of this province, $120 million profit that 
comes from the Liquor Board stores which they wanted to 
privatize, Mr. Speaker. And the fact of the matter is that if you 
sell off the farm by selling off the Liquor Board stores and 
selling off the Crown corporations, you don’t have the same 
amount of money, Mr. Speaker, to pay for the health care that 
we cherish in this province. 
 
So in answer to the question, Mr. Speaker, my answer is this: 
we can pay for public medicare because we have the Liquor 
Board store; we would not be able to afford those services if we 
followed their privatization policies, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Estevan. 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Mr. Speaker, at a time when this province’s 
financial situation is less than desirable, is it really time to be 
investing in new liquor stores? Aren’t there other priorities this 
government can point to that should be addressed first? Again 
when it comes to health care professionals such as those needed 
in Estevan to run a dialysis machine, this government pleads 
poverty. And yet they have $1.2 million for a brand new liquor 
store. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when will this government get its priorities 
straight and start addressing people’s needs? To the Premier: 



1690 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

why does this NDP government think a new liquor store in 
Estevan is more of a priority than funding health care 
professionals? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Industry and 
Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, I want the people of this 
province to know that dialysis treatment for people has been a 
high priority for this government. When this government came 
to office in 1991, Mr. Speaker, there were one or two sites in 
Saskatchewan where dialysis for kidney patients was available. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, in this province there are six or seven sites 
where dialysis is present. And, Mr. Speaker, when . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please, once again. And I appreciate all 
the help I can get. Minister of Industry and Resources. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Mr. Speaker, when we can find the staff to 
go to a dialysis centre in Estevan, it is the plan of this 
government to extend dialysis services to people who badly 
need it in all parts of the province as we have been doing, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
But I will say this also to the House: what we will never do is 
disable the Government of Saskatchewan from providing health 
services and education by following the privatization agenda of 
the members opposite. We will never do that, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, it is more than interesting, I would 
say to Saskatchewan people based on that minister’s answers, 
that he’s more than willing to go out and consult with the 
people of the province on their plan to spend $3.3 million on 
new Liquor Board stores, but they wouldn’t consult with 
communities before they closed beds and facilities for health 
care. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, we all receive . . . As MLAs, we 
receive from our constituents letters and correspondence and 
calls as to things that they would like to see happen in their 
constituencies and across this province. Well, Mr. Speaker, I 
don’t receive any calls or any letters from my constituents 
asking for a new Liquor Board store. 
 
I hear them asking for help on sewage treatment or the health 
care facility there. I don’t think the people in the Kindersley 
area are more concerned about a Liquor Board store than they 
are about ambulance service. And I don’t believe the people of 
Estevan would rather have money spent on a Liquor Board 
store instead of dialysis. 
 
To the Premier: explain please, if you will, to the people of the 
province, his priorities that would place new Liquor Board 
stores ahead of health care in Saskatchewan. 
 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that we 
would arrive at the close of this session and hear the 
Saskatchewan Party right back where we were well before the 
election. 
 
What is being said here, very clearly today — what is being 
said very clearly today is that the province of Saskatchewan, 
through its government, should be out of the Liquor Board 
business. That’s what they’re saying. We said that before the 
election, that they would seek to privatize the Liquor Board 
outlets; now we’re hearing it again today. Because, Mr. 
Speaker, the Liquor Board has to make its prudent decisions as 
well. 
 
Now the minister has made it very clear about the Liquor Board 
stores. If it’s the desire of the members opposite that these not 
be built in their communities, then the minister will be in fact 
following up on their idea. 
 
The fact of the matter is, whether it’s through our publicly 
owned utilities or whether it’s through a government Liquor 
Board distribution, revenues are provided for the public services 
of Saskatchewan — revenues that provide for 173 million new 
dollars in health, a $2.7 billion budget. Take those revenues out, 
Mr. Chair, take those revenues out and not only will it be the 
privatization of the Liquor Boards; we’ll see the privatization of 
health. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, that answer is the reason why 
people across this province are so disappointed with this 
government, Mr. Speaker, because I think even at the beginning 
of the session some of them thought that while they didn’t agree 
with the government’s policies, perhaps they could trust the 
government, perhaps they could trust the Premier. We’ve seen 
him break his promises, Mr. Speaker, time and time again. We 
saw it in the budget on almost every single promise they made 
in the campaign. 
 
And now today we see a Premier who . . . well he’s skirting the 
question, frankly, a little bit. But he refuses to explain to the 
people of this province on what planet any government would 
put a higher priority on a new building for Liquor Board stores 
— in places where, by the way, there already are buildings for 
the Liquor Boards — in what planet any government would put 
a higher priority on that than funding for health care. Will he 
stand up and explain himself to the people of the province on 
that, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to stand in this 
legislature, to stand on any platform in the province, and talk 
about the accomplishments of this government in this session 



June 17, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1691 

— any day, any place, any time. And the fact of the matter is 
today, Mr. Speaker, when we came into this session, we came 
. . . when we went to the election, and we came into the session, 
and we came with a commitment: to make life even better for 
Saskatchewan people. 
 
Now I am telling you today, Mr. Speaker, as a result of this 
session and activities of this government, life is better for 
Saskatchewan people. As a result of this session, people will 
enjoy smoke-free places across this province in public places. 
As a result of this session, people of Saskatchewan will have 
greater access to diagnostic health care services whether it’s CT 
scanners or new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or 
expansion of our existing programs. As a result of the work of 
the people of Saskatchewan, as a result of partnership with this 
government, we have more people working in Saskatchewan 
today, in April and May, than in any other April or May in the 
history of the province. As a result of this session we have set 
forward a biodiversity plan; we are building a green and a 
prosperous economy, Mr. Speaker. And as a result of the 
budgeting and the work of the Saskatchewan people, at the 
result of this session, we have a credit rating upgrade from 
Standard & Poor of New York. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, as a result of this 
session, the people of this province do not believe a word that 
Premier has to say. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Wall: — As a result of this session, people of this province 
understand with crystal clarity that this government has no 
vision for the great potential that we know exists here in the 
province of Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
(14:45) 
 
Mr. Wall: — And as a result of today, as a result of what we 
found out today, the people of this province understand that this 
Premier places a higher priority on building new Liquor Board 
buildings rather than providing health care and infrastructure in 
the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, would the Premier comment on one other thing? 
Would he comment on this, this fact — that as a result of this 
session, we are mercifully one more day, one day closer to the 
end of that government. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order. I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — What was it that Yogi Berra said? It’s 
déjà vu all over again. 
 
You know, you know, Mr. Speaker, there’s no difference over 
there at all. You know, when I was first honoured to receive the 

leadership of the New Democratic Party and therefore Premier 
of the province, you know what they said? I wouldn’t last six 
months. They said we wouldn’t last six months. Then they said, 
well we wouldn’t last a year. We won’t . . . But you know 
what? We lasted a year. Then they said, well for sure we won’t 
win an election. And well we won an election. Then they came 
into this session saying, well they’re going to defeat us; you 
know, they’re ready to take government. Well, you know, now 
the leader’s up again saying, well they’re going to defeat us 
next time. Well all right. This is not, this is not new. I guess it 
buoys up the troops over there. 
 
You know, the fact of the matter of this session, Mr. Chair, Mr. 
Speaker, we came into this session expecting a new opposition. 
Well there’s nothing new over there. What we have found from 
this opposition, what we have found from this opposition is no 
statement of new vision, no statement of new policy. 
 
They’ve got all the criticisms, Mr. Speaker. We’ve got the 
solution. We’ve got the plan. We’re implementing the plan for a 
better Saskatchewan, a better future for the next generation for 
the Saskatchewan people. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I thank all members for their participation. 
 
I recognize the Minister of Justice. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — . . . opposite’s enthusiasm upon my 
rising to my feet. I’m requesting leave to introduce guests, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave to introduce guests? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Leave has been granted. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS

MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
 

Establishment of Traditional Elders  
Ministerial Advisory Committee 

 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand in 
the House today to announce the establishment of a Traditional 



1692 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

Elders Ministerial Advisory Committee to the Departments of 
Justice and Corrections, and Public Safety. 
 
Earlier today I joined with the Minister of Corrections and 
Public Safety and elders representing Aboriginal communities 
throughout our province in a signing ceremony at the First 
Nations University of Canada. Prior to the ceremony we shared 
in a feast and a pipe ceremony led by the elders. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is a significant day for Aboriginal 
communities throughout Saskatchewan and for the 
administration of justice in our province. Today we move one 
step closer to achieving our goal of a justice system that 
responds to the needs, values, and aspirations of Aboriginal 
people. We know that the relationship between the justice 
system and Aboriginal people in this province has been 
characterized by feelings of alienation and mistrust for many 
years. And, Mr. Speaker, we know that in order to change that, 
we must work together. The signing ceremony that we 
participated in today is significant for what it represents: a 
combination of hope, healing, and co-operation. 
 
Elders are the traditional leaders in their communities. They 
impact the values, morals, ethics, attitudes, and behaviours of 
the people in their circle. They serve as guides and role models 
for others to follow in their journey through life. Mr. Speaker, 
all the elders who sit on this advisory committee do so because 
they were chosen by their communities. I am grateful to the 
elders for their willingness to work with us and to share their 
wisdom and knowledge. We have as much to learn from the 
ways of healing, the ways of reconciliation, and the ways of 
reconstructing the broken circle. The elders on this committee 
will help us to develop a better understanding and to walk a 
better path together.  
 
Mr. Speaker, in order for the justice system to be effective and 
fair, it must be respectful of cultural differences. It must 
contribute to the strength and well-being of our communities, 
and it must recognize that our system is not superior to other 
ways of dealing with socially harmful conduct. 
 
It has long been our view that at the heart of an effective crime 
prevention, crime reduction strategy is the need for 
communities to deliver justice programs that complement the 
criminal justice system. For communities to take ownership of 
the offending and victimization that occurs in their community, 
they must have the capacity to take on the challenge. We look 
forward to working with the Traditional Elders Ministerial 
Advisory Committee to build that capacity and to develop 
meaningful partnerships with Aboriginal communities, based on 
knowledge, trust, and respect. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this government is committed to adjusting the 
justice system to respond to needs and values of Aboriginal 
people, and contribute to a more inclusive society. This is an 
historic step that we take today, which will no doubt provide a 
better tomorrow for the children of this province. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 

Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I am very pleased to 
respond today on behalf of the official opposition. 
 
I am very honoured that the province has seen fit to recognize 
the importance of Aboriginal justice system and the benefits 
that it can bring to the people and the system. And I’m sure 
over the next few years there is going to be people who will be 
able to see their culture and their history well displayed, and 
maybe it will help speed the healing that is needed within our 
system. 
 
I know that what’s happened today in our system isn’t always 
working, and that Aboriginal people have asked the government 
to look at their needs and their concerns, and show that no, 
there is another way. And I really respect the traditions that are 
going to be brought into the system, and I really think . . . and 
we appreciate the opportunity to listen to what you have to say. 
And I think the government has done a great job in working 
with the Aboriginal people. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

Clause 1

Speaker . . . or, Mr. Chair of Committees, we’ve had the 
opportunity in committee to thoroughly discuss this Bill with 
the minister and his officials. And I have stated at the 
committee level that we believed that the amendment proposed 
in the wording in clause no. 12 is not what the people of 
Saskatchewan want — that indeed there was a promise to the 
people of Saskatchewan that the indexing of the exemptions 
would continue. 
 
And that was a plan that was put forward by this very 
government a number of years ago with a lot of fanfare, that 
indeed they were happy to see that the indexation of personal 
exemptions was going to be tied to the national consumer price 
index. Clause no. 12 breaks that and actually removes that 
automatic indexation where now it will be just at the decision of 

the cabinet. 
 
So, Mr. Chair, we oppose clause no. 12. And at the appropriate 
time when we go through this Bill, the official opposition will 
be voting against clause no. 12. 
 
The Chair: — Clause 1 short title. Is clause 1 agreed? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
Clause 1 agreed to.

The Chair: — Therefore Her Majesty, by and with the advice 
and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan, 
enacts as follows: Bill No. 70, an Act to amend the income tax, 
2000. 
 
The next item before the committee . . . (inaudible interjection) 
. . . Oh, I would ask the Minister of Finance to move that the 
committee report the Bill without amendment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Chair, I move the committee

Council Amendment Act, 2004 

 
The Chair: — The next item before the committee is Bill No.

Amendment Act, 2004. 
 
Clause 1 short title. Is clause 1 agreed? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Chair: — That is carried. 
 
Clauses 1 to 3 inclusive agreed to. 
 
Clause 4 
 

The Chair: — Is clause 4 agreed? I recognize the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. 
Chairman, as we have pointed . . . Too many different 
committees here operating under different rules. As we have 
pointed out previously on this particular piece of legislation, we 
have a great deal of concern with the changes of this particular 
amendment that would change the bylaw election rule from a 
bylaw must be called within six months of a vacancy to a bylaw 
must be called within six months, within the first 36 months of 
a 60-month mandate. And we believe that is inappropriate, Mr. 
Chairman. 
 
And hopefully we’ll be able to convince some of the members 
opposite that the decisions, that were made by themselves or 
their predecessors in those ridings they represent in 1991 by 
their political party, were the right decisions — that it is 
undemocratic to allow for seats to remain vacant for up to two 
years, which is what this amendment to the electoral Act does, 
Mr. Chairman. 
 
The government has raised the issue that it’s a waste of money 
to have a by-election followed shortly thereafter by a general 
election. But the Premier is the one who makes that decision, 
not the piece of legislation that says a bylaw should be held 
within six months . . . a by-election, I mean. If the Premier 
doesn’t want to have a by-election happening within six months 
of the general election, all he has to do is call the general 
election. 
 
The Premier says well, we always have the election at about 
four years, so there is no need for this. The most that a seat 
could remain vacant would be 12 months. Well, Mr. Chairman, 
let’s take a look at the history. In 1999 under this current 
government, the elections were 51 months apart, Mr. Chairman 
— 51 months. So that’s 15 months a seat could have been 
vacant from the 36-month period to the time the election 
happened. 
 
Under this current . . . Oh the member from Regina Dewdney is 
saying that’s not . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . okay. Regina 
Northeast, Mr. Chairman, is saying that’s not the case. Well all 
he has to do is go back and look at the electoral records. It’s 
very plain to see. It’s very plain to see. It was 15 months from 
36-month period within that mandate to the time the election 
was called in 1999. 
 
In the year 2003, it was 14 months that that period occurred. So 
there is . . . the Premier may say oh no, I am going to call an 
election at four years. There is no legislation that says he has to 
call it within four years. We’ve called for that; the government 
isn’t interested. 
 
So, Mr. Chairman, they’re reversing the democratic 
advancement that was made in 1991. Mr. Chairman, Bob 
Mitchell, in 1991 in his statements in the House, said that 
Kindersley, which had waited 22 months was too long. Indian 
Head-Wolseley, which had waited 21 months, is too long. 
Turtleford, which had waited 16 months, was too long. And 
Souris-Cannington, the riding where, Mr. Chairman, I sat and 
waited for an election, was 15 months. Well from 36 months to 
51 months is 15 months, Mr. Chairman. And that is what Roy 



1700 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

Romanow did in 1999. This government supported that, Mr. 
Chairman. 
 
I’d also like to read another quote from Mr. Mitchell. And to 
quote the Hon. Bob Mitchell. He says: 
 

These amendments, Mr. Speaker, will make the law of 
Saskatchewan consistent with the law in other jurisdictions 
and will, as I said, protect the democratic rights of citizens 
to representation in this Assembly. 

 
Well I guess the Premier and the government opposite don’t 
believe that those rights need to be protected any longer. 
 
(15:30) 
 
We still need to have that protection in place, Mr. Speaker. The 
six-month rule from the time a seat becomes vacant to a 
by-election, a minimum of six . . . a maximum, excuse me, of 
six months is appropriate, and we continue to support that, Mr. 
Chairman. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Chair: — I recognize the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, let me just say at the 
outset, if it weren’t for the abuses of the 1980s we would likely 
not be dealing with this legislation today because we would not 
have needed legislation in the first instance. The 1980s saw 
abuses of the electoral process. In the one instance, the 
government refusing to call an election until the five years were 
up. The government also refused to call by-elections in a timely 
manner. 
 
This had not been any kind of issue in Saskatchewan previous 
to that because governments respected the democratic process, 
respected the fact that if there were vacancies, if by-elections 
were required, that those by-elections should be called in a 
timely manner . . . didn’t need laws, didn’t need legislation to 
tell them that. 
 
Well we set out to change that in 1991, notwithstanding the fact 
that members were cautioning us to put into place some 
guidelines. And I well remember the comments of the member 
for Souris-Cannington who just stood in his place where he 
said: 
 

A general Bill legislating by-elections is important, but 
certain restrictions must be implemented. This side of the 
House recognizes the unnecessary costs and inconvenience 
that will be incurred by the people of Saskatchewan if a 
by-election was to be held in the last months of a 
government’s mandate. 

 
And that’s what the member said at that point. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, now here we are some 13 years later, many 
by-elections later, and we finally agree with the member 
opposite that there should be some restrictions. 
 
We have faced criticisms in some instances during general 
elections which followed by-elections because we followed the 
rules of the legislation. We’re criticized by people on the 

doorsteps, aided undoubtedly by the members opposite 
encouraging them to criticize the government for that. 
 
We think that it’s time to put some restriction in place. The 
restriction we are offering is not an unreasonable one, but we’re 
also prepared to move an amendment. The legislation that’s 
before us anticipates that a government might call an election 
within three and a half years. We’re certainly prepared to 
change it to anticipate the fact that a government calls an 
election within four years. And therefore, Mr. Chairman, I 
move an amendment to clause 4 of the printed Bill: 
 

Amend subsection 40.3(2) of The Legislative Assembly 
and Executive Council Act, as being enacted by Clause 4 
of the printed Bill by striking out “36 months” and 
substituting “40 months”. 
 

I so move, Mr. Chair. 
 
The Chair: — Will the members take the motion as read? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Chair: — The motion by the minister, is this agreed? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed.

The Chair: — The clause 4 as amended, is that agreed? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Chair: — That’s carried. 
 
Clause 4 as amended agreed to on division. 
 
Clauses 5 to 7 inclusive agreed to.

The Chair: — And coming into force clause 8. Is clause 8 
agreed?

MOTION 
 

House Adjournment 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, before I move the 
motion, I’d like to offer a few comments. This is my first 
opportunity to move this motion as a Government House 
Leader. It’s been a very interesting session for me. 
 
I now begin to understand the calls that I received after I was 
appointed House Leader from those who had previously served 
as House Leader, and offering their sympathies because it is, at 
the end of the day, as former House leaders know, a very 
interesting and challenging position, but I think a position that’s 
made more enjoyable and helpful with the co-operation of 
colleagues. 
 
(16:00) 
 
But the session is rarely about individuals. I guess if there was 
one exception, we saw that this year. Usually the sessions are 
about the differences that we hold and ideas and policies and 
approaches for our province, and those are the things that we 
debate. 
 
Sometimes though there are exceptions, and I think we saw that 
this particular session when we were able to welcome back a 
healthy member for Yorkton after a successful fight for cancer. 
That for me definitely was one of the highlights of the session. 
And we’re very pleased to see that. I think all members of the 
House will . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — As for other highlights of the 
session, Mr. Speaker, I thought for a moment that one of the 
highlights was going to be while I was reading my budget 
speech, at quite a ways in I noticed that one of my feet was 
falling asleep. And there I was trying to read this speech, while 
at the same time shaking my foot to get some life back into it. 
That was an interesting experience for me. 
 
But I think the real highlight of the session, Mr. Speaker, was to 
see the new committee system in action. I think that was quite 
something. For someone like myself who’s been in this House 
since 1986, to see this new procedure — I think probably one of 
the more substantial, if not the most substantial change that 
we’ve seen to the workings of the House since 1905 — to see 
these committee systems at work, I was quite struck by not only 
the greater scrutiny I think that legislation and estimates seem 
to receive in the new policy field committees, I was also struck 
by the greater participation of all of the members of the House 
were able to serve on those committees and those who chitted in 
for other members in those committees. I thought that was just 
exceptional, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And I want to pay tribute to those members of the Special 
Committee on Rules and Procedures that was chaired by 
yourself, Mr. Speaker; the member for Regina South, the 
member for Cannington, the member for Moose Jaw North, the 
member for Saskatoon Eastview, the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone, the member for Biggar, the member for 
Regina Dewdney. 



1704 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

And I read these names into the record because at the end of the 
day this is a huge transformation of how we do business. And 
those members that came up with those recommendations 
deserve the applause and appreciation, not just to the members 
of the Assembly but the people of Saskatchewan. And I thank 
them. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, this session also saw 
an agreement between the government and the opposition as to 
how we might better structure the sittings of the Legislative 
Assembly, a first move if you will towards a legislative 
calendar, a more formal sitting calendar. 
 
I very much appreciate the efforts of the Opposition House 
Leader, the member for Melfort, in his contributions to those 
discussions. I also want to thank the House Leader for always 
his positive co-operation and his professional manner. I very 
much appreciate the contribution of the Opposition House 
Leader, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Normally at this time of the 
session we come to say goodbye, and we come to say thank you 
to all of the members and all of those who support the members, 
but I think it’s somewhat premature. 
 
Because of the agreement that we have, we’ve agreed now that 
this is not the end of the session. We’ve agreed that the end of 
the session will be this fall, and that at this point we are taking a 
recess from the action so that we can do the things that we need 
to do this summer and into the fall to prepare for the fall 
session. 
 
And so we do not come here today to say goodbye, Mr. 
Speaker. We do not come to say thank you to all of those 
including yourself and the Clerks who help us to move the 
business of the people of Saskatchewan along, but we do want 
to at this point I think recognize that some of those who help us 
may not be with us in the fall. 
 
In particular the Pages, Donovan Ackerman, Alex Arsenault, 
Cali Boyle, Danielle Humble, Scott Robertson, and Julianna 
Hill, we want to thank them for the exemplary service that 
they’ve provided to all of the members during the course of this 
session. And I would ask all the members to join with me in 
extending a warm hand of appreciation to them. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Also not likely to be with us, Mr. 
Speaker, this fall are the interns who so ably assisted some of 
our colleagues in their duties. And the interns are Kim 
McKechney, Ryan Griffiths, Joanne Harpauer-Dignean, and 
Fabian Contreras. I would ask all members to recognize the 
contribution made by those interns, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — So thank you, Mr. Speaker, and 
thank you to all the members for their hard work during this 

session and for making it a very productive session. I look 
forward to seeing all the members this fall. I wish all the 
members a very enjoyable summer, a productive fall, and thank 
you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And having said that, Mr. Speaker, I guess now I’m required to 
move the motion — and if I can find the motion, here it is. I 
move: 
 

That when this Assembly adjourns at the end of the sitting 
day, it shall stand adjourned to the date and the time set by 
Mr. Speaker upon the request of the government, and that 
Mr. Speaker shall give each member seven clear days 
notice, if possible, of such date and time. 

 
I move, seconded by the member for Melfort. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for Regina 
Douglas Park, seconded by the member from Melfort: 
 

That when this Assembly adjourns at the end of the sitting 
day, it shall stand adjourned to the date and the time set by 
Mr. Speaker upon the request of the government, and that 
Mr. Speaker shall give each member seven clear days 
notice, if possible, of such date and time. 

 
I recognize the Opposition House Leader, the member for 
Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s 
with pleasure that I rise this afternoon and join with the 
Government House Leader in expressing a few remarks at the 
recess, if you like, of this legislative session. 
 
And in doing that, I would like to first of all recognize the 
contribution of the Sergeant-at-Arms by contributing a 
particular rodent to the member from Kelvington’s seat this 
afternoon. Her heart rate is now coming down from 200 or 
somewhere through that sphere, and I’m sure it’ll be a 
memorable occasion for all of us who watched the panic on her 
face as she thought there was a rat in her seat. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s also true that we are going to have the services 
of the Pages no longer with us, and of the interns. And I would 
like to join with the Government House Leader in thanking 
each and every one of them for the outstanding service that 
you’ve contributed to the members. 
 
It’s been a very interesting session, and in so many ways. For 
the Government House Leader and myself, we were new to the 
task — and the task was also new to us in that the challenges of 
the Assembly were different this time as the Government House 
Leader has outlined. 
 
I think that, as we have felt our way through these new standing 
field committees, members have expressed a great deal of 
support for the concept and the structure and the balance 
between even the Committee of Finance and the field 
committees. And I think we’ll look forward to further 
developing this whole system to better serve the needs not only 
of the members of the Assembly but also the people of 



June 17, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1705 

Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I think it’s true — and certainly it is very true for 
my part — that it would have been impossible for me to 
discharge my duties without the assistance particularly of my 
House colleagues, the Opposition Whip, the Deputy House 
Leader, and the Deputy Whip. And I would like to thank them 
particularly for being so supportive in contributing to the efforts 
that we made in making sure this legislature functioned 
appropriately. 
 
I also want to extend to my colleagues on the official opposition 
for their support and contribution and advice as we’ve gone 
along, and I think that that has contributed to us doing our job 
as expected. 
 
I want to comment briefly about our efforts in making the 
motion and the movement towards a permanent calendar. I 
think as we said when we announced this, this is not only good 
for us as members and legislators, it’s good for the people of 
Saskatchewan, it’s good for democracy, that we meet oftener 
and that we meet in a predictable way so that the people can 
understand and count on the fact that their legislature is going to 
meet to consider the issues of the province on a regular basis. 
 
But as important as all as that is, Mr. Speaker, in closing I also 
want to acknowledge on behalf of, I’m sure all members, the 
contribution and sacrifice that our families make to allow us to 
do this job and to conduct the affairs of the province in this 
calendar or in a future calendar. When we leave home in the 
morning on Monday or Sunday night to come to Regina in 
order to discharge our duties, many times we would rather be at 
home with our families, and many times our families are 
disappointed that we’re not home as regularly as we should be. 
 
And I think, Mr. Speaker, it’s important to always remind 
ourselves of the important contribution that our families make 
to the democratic process in this legislature, and I know all 
members want to join me in applauding our families. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Mr. Speaker, having said that on behalf of 
the official opposition, it’s my pleasure to congratulate all the 
members for the work that they’ve done in this Assembly, to 
wish them a very relaxing and peaceful summer with their 
families so that they can be rejuvenated to the task that’s before 
us, providing the very best governance and legislative authority 
for the people of this province because they deserve no less. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Before I put the motion, I would like to just 
make a couple of remarks with respect to the work given to the 
members by the Legislative Assembly employees. 
 
I especially want to thank and commend the Office of the Clerk, 
who continue to provide non-partisan leadership to the rest of 
the Legislative Assembly. And things work very smoothly here 
and I’ve watched as . . . even to the detail of the parade, how 
they’ve learned to all turn in unison — one day clockwise and 
the next day counter-clockwise — as they watch the mace come 
in. 

Special thank you goes out to the people working in human 
resources and administrative services and the information 
services branch who sort of keep the nuts and bolts of working 
here. People in Journals for their accuracy and efficiency. And 
of course, those in financial services who make sure that our 
constituency assistants and the caucuses and all the people in 
the Legislative Assembly and the MLAs get the payroll. 
 
The people in broadcast services deserve thanks. They take a lot 
of pride in their work in keeping the system here going. Thanks 
to the visitor services who are our ambassadors of the 
legislature, to all of our guests. To the Legislative Counsel on 
whom I would depend on for their advice on legal matters. To 
our people in the Legislative Library, if it exists— if 
information exists — they’ll find it. And special thank you goes 
to the people in security and also the sessional commissionaires. 
They serve this Assembly with distinction. 
 
Hansard — all the workers in Hansard, of course who have to 
stay on a little later yet today and then this summer pack up all 
their equipment as they get ready to move into new quarters. 
 
I want to thank all of the members of the Assembly in this 
House, particularly for the camaraderie, both in the Assembly 
and out. It’s been a pleasure to work with both House leaders. 
 
I would also make special mention of two MLAs who have 
bookended the daily proceedings. First of all the member for 
Cypress Hills, who has presented 69 petitions, I think. And 
second the member for Moose Jaw North, who has always 
commented with encouragement about this choice of the 
starting time for the next day. 
 
And I want to express a thank you to my staff in the Speaker’s 
office, Margaret Tulloch, Linda Spence and Rhonda Romanuk 
for steering me through the day. 
 
And special thanks goes out on behalf of all members to Steve 
Bata and the SPMC (Saskatchewan Property Management 
Corporation) who keep us well-housed and even take care of 
the occasional flood that happens in this building. 
 
(16:15) 
 
I salute the Pages who work with diligence and also with some 
humour. We appreciate that. And the interns who have been 
working with us this year. 
 
I want to conclude by saying that the people who work here in 
the Legislative Assembly provide exemplary, non-partisan 
service to the members of the Legislative Assembly. I want to 
thank the employees for their commitment which provides a 
professional continuity necessary for the operation of our 
legislature. 
 
On the motion moved by the member for Regina Douglas Park, 
seconded by the member for Melfort, will members take it as 
read? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 



1706 Saskatchewan Hansard June 17, 2004 

Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. This House stands 
adjourned until the call of the Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Assembly adjourned at 16:16.
