LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Second Session — Thirteenth Legislature 

12th Day 

 

Friday, February 28, 1958 

 

The House met at 2:30 o'clock p.m. 

On the Orders of the Day: 

 

BUDGET ADDRESS 

 

Hon. C.M. Fines (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, this is the fourteenth consecutive occasion it 

has been my privilege and responsibility to submit the traditional Motion of Supply, and to indicate to 

the House something of the broad framework of the Government's budgetary proposals for the year 

ahead. Despite this fairly lengthy record I find my task today a somewhat unique and difficult 

experience. It is the first time in fourteen years I have had to present a budget under the shadow of a 

federal general election — and subject therefore to all the uncertainties that inevitably arise from such an 

event. 

 

Indeed, I may say that even prior to the recent abrupt dissolution of Parliament, the unsettled, erratic 

state of affairs at Ottawa had injected a considerable measure of uncertainty into our own public 

finances. This has been particularly true of changes in federal programs requiring matching provincial 

expenditures. Consultation with the provinces seems to have been ruled out and completely unilateral 

decisions by Ottawa, made known by press announcements, now seem to be the order of the day. This 

arbitrary approach was even extended to federal-provincial fiscal relations, where the Federal 

Government appeared to rely upon undelivered telegrams and newspaper reports to advise us of sudden 

changes in policy. Now that the election has been called, the situation is even worse. I should warn the 

Honourable Members that the normal course of budget planning and control may be seriously violated 

by the unpredictable gyrations of federal policy during the period ahead. 

 

In turning now, Mr. Speaker, to our customary review of the economic background, I must first of all, 

refer to the developing trends of the year just past. It will be recalled that 1956 was a year of tremendous 

expansion in the Canadian and United States economies, with a record-breaking advance in capital 

investment stimulating a vigorous industrial boom. This expansion carried over into the early part of 

1957, and the steadily rising inflationary situation led to rather belated measures of monetary and credit 

restriction. By mid-1957, however, it was clear that the forces underlying the boom had been pretty well 

spent. The months following have witnessed a marked slowing down of business activity with declines 

occurring in many key economic indicators.

It may be noted that the majority of analysts have now discarded such qualified expressions as "rolling 

re-adjustment" and "sideways movement" and are now speaking frankly of an "economic recession". 

The slow-down, moreover, appears to be as marked in Canada as in the United States. In this country 

industrial production has been edging downward since early in 1957. Corporation profits, seasonally 

adjusted, have been declining steadily. By last December 1st, the employment index had fallen below 

the level of twelve months previously. The volume of retail trade and the value of Canadian exports 

were barely holding their own. The gross national product for 1957 is now estimated at no more than 

three per cent higher than the previous year in dollar terms compared with the previous yearly advance 

of some 11 per cent. The impact of all this, as the Assembly is fully aware, has been a steadily rising rate 

of unemployment. At the present time the number of persons out of work and seeking jobs across the 

country is estimated at nine to ten per cent of the civilian labour force. 

 

In the face of the overall business decline, it is most encouraging to note that the industrial economy of 

Saskatchewan continued to advance in 1957. Despite weakness in some sectors, such as lumber and 

pulpwood, the gross value of non-farm commodity production rose about seven per cent higher than in 

1956. At the same time the index of industrial employment at December 1st, in contrast to the national 

picture, continued to hold gains achieved over the previous year. 

 

Mineral production again made the most important advance in the province. The 1957 value of output is 

placed at about $158 million, 37 per cent higher than in 1956. Substantial gains in oil and uranium more 

than offset some weakness in industrial minerals and a decline in value of base metals caused by sharply 

lower prices for copper and zinc. The construction industry operated at peak levels throughout most of 

the year, and the value of work performed is expected to surpass the record "intentions" figure of $365 

million forecast early in 1957. In manufacturing, the output of such new plants as steel pipe, cement, 

wire and cable, paper bags and so forth, was added to long established industries, and total value of 

shipments rose to about $320 million. Electric power production showed little sign of slackening its rate 

of increase. Kilowatt hours consumed rose to almost 1.2 billion, a four-fold increase in the past decade. 

 

The stabilizing influence of expanding industrial growth in the province was further highlighted by 

certain contrary developments in our basic agriculture during the year just past. Primarily because of 

lower grain deliveries, farm cash receipts declined to about $511 million, a decrease of some 15 per 

cent. A substantial rise in cattle marketings was the most important factor in preventing an even sharper 

fall in cash income. Cash advances on farm stored grain provided a nominal income supplement late in 

the year. At December 15 last there were almost 18,000 farmers who had taken advantage of the 

program to collect about $14 million in advances. 



 

February 28, 1958

More critical trends were evident in the farm net income picture in 1957. Although yield per acre was 

close to the long-term average, the total crop out-turn fell far short of the bumper levels of 1955 and 

1956. A decline in inventories occurred, farm prices again moved downward, and farm costs again 

moved upward. The inevitable result was an unusually sharp cut in net income. As evidence of the 

continuing cost-price squeeze, it may be noted that the index of Saskatchewan farm prices, on the 1935-

39 base, fell to an estimated 187.5, a reduction over the year of about twenty points. On the other hand 

the index of Western Canada farm costs rose approximately six points to reach the new high of 249.5 in 

1957. 

 

It is this basically adverse situation that explains more than anything else the grave concern voiced by 

western agriculture over the trends of the past several years. That concern was vividly expressed in the 

storm of criticism directed against the first inept draft of the new federal Agricultural Stabilization bill. 

The successive drastic revisions of the legislation forced upon the Federal Government have effected 

some improvements. Since the Act itself contains very few specific guarantees, however, the real test 

will come in its application and administration. So far as Saskatchewan agriculture is concerned, of 

course, the fundamental failure of the Conservative Government has been its unwillingness or inability 

to provide specific support price legislation for prairie wheat, oats and barley. As Honourable Members 

well know, the new bill does not include these three overwhelmingly important crops. The importance 

of these grains is readily judged from the fact that the past ten years they have accounted for about 70 

per cent of total cash income received by prairie farmers. Obviously we shall make no real progress 

toward assuring our farmers a fair share of the national income unless and until the Federal Government 

adopts a firm plan to correct this grave deficiency in its agricultural policy. 

 

This brief comment upon developments of the past year will help, I think, to shed some light upon the 

outlook for 1958-59. On the national and international economic scene, we are now moving through the 

third cyclical recession of the postwar period. I am sure we all share the hope that, as in 1949 and 1954, 

the downturn will be short-lived, and that economic activity will swing sharply upward again in the 

latter half of this year. This thought has been expressed in President Eisenhower's annual economic 

report. A considerable body of opinion, however, has criticized the report as being unduly optimistic and 

has called for vigorous government policies to bolster the economy. 

 

Similar differences of opinion are current in Canada. The present decline is not regarded as signifying a 

major depression. But in the face of such weaknesses as excess capacity in both manufacturing and 

resource industries, lagging farm income and commodity exports, and reduced private capital 

investment, it is difficult to point to 



 

February 28, 1958

important dynamic forces likely to give the national economy an early, upward push. There is, in fact, 

considerable concern that unemployment is likely to remain a very difficult national problem for months 

after the usual seasonal pick-up in the spring. 

 

The influence of this somewhat clouded national outlook suggests the need for considerable caution in 

appraising our own economic prospects in 1958. There are, however, a number of special factors 

affecting the fortunes of this province that seem to justify a reasonably optimistic view of the immediate 

Saskatchewan outlook. 

 

The first of these has to do with possibilities for moderate improvement in farm income. Several 

favourable features may be noted in the current wheat marketing and export picture. The generally 

higher protein content of the 1957 crop, and lowered out-turns in Australia and the Argentine, have 

improved our position in world markets. A much belated government policy of extending sales on 

longer credit terms, particularly for Colombo Plan countries, should help to expand exports. Moreover, 

the lower premium on the Canadian dollar is helping to increase gross returns. At the same time some 

levelling of production costs should develop, with consequent improvement of net income. Substantial 

quantities of grain held on the farms — estimated at the year-end at roughly 500 million bushels — 

provide a continued hedge against adverse weather conditions. Finally, farm income should be further 

bolstered by continuing improvement in livestock marketings, provided that the level of demand is not 

curtailed by a really serious recession. 

 

A number of favourable actors also point to further expansion in the non-farm sector of the provincial 

economy in 1958. This is particularly true of the mineral industries. Despite the squeeze on markets, oil 

production is expected to rise still further, one forecast places total value of crude oil output at about 

$100 million this year, compared to $77 million in 1957. The exploration and development program 

should continue at a high level, particularly with the encouraging results to date in testing lower 

geological horizons. Expanded distribution facilities assure a further increase in natural gas production. 

Similarly the enlarged capacity of mills in the Beaverlodge area point to a further advance in uranium 

output. While the potash mines and mills will not achieve any significant production until next year, 

development expenditure will reach a new high. On the other hand, short of a really massive expansion 

of the U.S. defence program, considerably greater than the ten per cent increase recently proposed by the 

President, an early recover in base metals, other minerals, lumber and pulpwood seems doubtful. 

 

The internally-based industries should be sustained by the needs of the overall provincial market. This 

includes both manufacturing and electric power production. Comprehensive statistics data are not yet 

available on investment trends, but there is little reason to anticipate 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

 

5 

any serious decline from current peak levels of construction. Public investment in buildings, services 

and utilities of all kinds will rise still higher in 1958. Resource development and private manufacturing, 

particularly in oil refining, as well as commercial building, are all expected to maintain recent high 

levels. The outlook for housing and for investment generally will be aided by substantially easier money 

conditions and lower interest rates. 

 

The overall levelling off of economic activity, then, I think we can again look forward with reasonable 

confidence to another good year for Saskatchewan. Under normal crop conditions, there is some reason 

to anticipate an upturn in farm income. Our industrial growth has certain uniquely favourable aspects, 

and total non-farm commodity production seems likely to record a further encouraging advance. In total, 

while personal disposable income before taxes for the province declined narrowly in 1957, projections 

for 1958 point to a new high record level of over $1.2 billion. Current indicators of inter-provincial 

migration also point to a significant recovery of population growth by June 1st of this year. Our budget 

proposals for 1958-59 are aimed at reinforcing the process of economic growth, bolstering those sectors 

in greatest difficulty, and ensuring a fair and just distribution of the fruits of increasing production. 

 

I come now, Mr. Speaker, to a further subject of major significance in our budget making — the 

problem of dominion-provincial relations. The Assembly is well aware of the hazards involved in 

forecasting economic trends, especially during a period of marked change. But on this occasion, as I 

have already suggested, an even greater difficulty is raised by the impossibility of guessing just what is 

going to happen at Ottawa. Events of the past few months have certainly made this plain. 

 

Late last November the provinces were summoned to a further dominion-provincial conference by the 

new Federal Government in view of the many election pledges made by that government, and the 

explicit invitation to submit our views on pressing issues, we felt fully justified in urging upon the 

Dominion a number of specific measures of great importance to Saskatchewan. I think it worthwhile to 

review our proposals briefly today. 

 

First, we joined with all the provinces in asking that the general system of tax-sharing arrangements be 

revised to allow the provinces a substantially greater share or the direct tax revenues. Together with this, 

we urged that the equalization principle should be fully carried out by providing for equal per capita 

payments to all provinces from these nation-wide tax sources. We also laid further stress upon the 

financial needs of the less wealthy provinces and pressed for a system of fiscal need grants, to be 

determined by means of an impartial statistical formula and payable to any or all qualifying provinces. 



 

February 28, 1958

Our second main request was for special measures to aid the municipalities, both by increasing transfers 

of tax revenue and by providing adequate funds at low rates of interest for capital works. Third, we 

reiterated our belief that federal participation in hospital insurance should commence on January 1st, 

1958, and that the national plan should certainly be broadened to permit coverage of tuberculosis and 

mental hospitals. Our fourth proposal was for a concrete framework to facilitate joint federal-provincial 

investment in resource development — including, of course, the carrying out of Mr. Diefenbaker's 

pledge to start construction of the South Saskatchewan River project within six months of last June's 

election. Fifth, we pressed for an early federal-provincial conference at the highest level, specially 

designed to work upon solutions to the urgent problems of declining farm income. Finally we drew 

attention to the looming threat of unemployment and proposed an immediate start on planning a 

program of employment-creating public works. 

 

Set out in such summary form, this may appear to be a far-reaching list of objectives. But set against the 

needs or the capacity of our country, I am convinced they are neither extravagant nor unrealistic. Indeed, 

it may be noted that in recent months the Federal Government has put forward several gestures in 

support of them. It is, therefore, all the more disappointing that we have seen so little genuine progress 

toward their achievement. 

 

Certainly the so-called "interim" adjustment in the tax-sharing arrangements, involving an increase from 

10 to 13 per cent of federal personal income tax rates to be made available to the provinces falls short of 

the needs of the provinces and municipalities. Not only is it woefully inadequate, but it is provided for 

one year only. It is disquieting, too, not to receive from the federal Minister of Finance a firm assurance 

that the equalization formula will be upheld in at least its present form. Indeed a majority of provinces 

had hoped that it would be improved. While we welcome the special grants to the Atlantic provinces, 

they have been rightly criticized as smacking of a charitable handout, rather than based upon a sound 

principle as a matter of right. We feel that a far more constructive policy would have been to adopt our 

proposal to provide such aid on the basis of an objective formula applicable across the nation. As for 

hospital insurance, it is clear that the Federal Government has now turned its back upon its pledge to 

include mental and tuberculosis hospitals. Moreover, it is impossible to understand why that same 

Government would not take legislative steps before dissolving Parliament to guarantee that the starting 

date for federal participation will in fact be July 1st next. In the past month a great deal of fanfare and 

publicity has been given to announcements of resource development projects, aid for agriculture, and 

employment-creating public works, yet as recently as the last November conference, the administration 

at Ottawa turned a completely deaf ear to all provincial proposals for action along these lines.

As for inter-governmental relations within Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker, I stress again that it is this 

Government's firm policy to provide increasing aid to the municipalities and other local jurisdictions. 

The budgetary proposals which I shall detail in a few moments will again make this policy crystal clear. 

 

At the same time I must reiterate my conviction that merely providing more money cannot in the long 

run properly encourage and protect the democratic vigour and independence of local government in our 

province. For this reason I am particularly happy that all the organizations representing our rural and 

urban municipalities, school bodies, and other local institutions, have joined in the work of the local 

Government Continuing Committee to give it their whole-hearted support. 

 

The Assembly will recall, I am sure, the historic conference of December 1956, and its culminating 

resolution. In accord with that resolution, the Committee has been hard at work for the past six months. 

It is undertaking what is probably the most thorough-going study of the organization, structure, 

responsibilities, and fiscal problems of local government ever attempted in Canada. The estimates 

provide for pushing ahead with this huge and difficult task throughout the next fiscal year. I cannot 

attempt here to anticipate the final results. Nevertheless I am confident that the Committee will come up 

with a plan that will command support both for its regard to the enduring importance of local democracy 

and for the realistic, yet far-seeing changes it will undoubtedly propose. 

 

The operating results of the provincial Crown Corporations in 1957 reflect the influence of some of the 

chequered economic trends I have previously noted. Although the annual reports have not yet been 

completely audited, I should like to report here briefly on the basis of preliminary figures. The total 

volume of sales and services registered a further substantial increase of 11 per cent over the previous 

year, rising to more than $63,000,000. At December 31st last, 5,144 men and women served in the 

various companies, and the total payroll for the year amounted to more than $18,000,000. The record-

breaking expansion in the power, gas and telephone systems forecast in the budget of one year ago 

boosted our advances to all the self-liquidating enterprises to some $234,000,000. Gross surpluses 

before interest for 1957 increased to $11,515,584. However, with a higher cost for money and lower 

earnings from several of the smaller companies, net surpluses after interest are placed at about 

$4,500,000, a slight decrease from one year ago. 



 

February 28, 1958

The statement of advances and earnings placed on the record here shows that two companies incurred 

deficits. The first of these, the Wood Enterprises Division of Saskatchewan Forest Products, has 

continued to face increasing difficulties. The rapid substitution of corrugated paper for wooden boxes, 

the lagging grain movement reducing the demand for grain doors used in box cars, and depressed 

markets in the furniture industry beyond the province have made the outlook so bleak that it was decided 

to discontinue the manufacturing operation. The deficit of $144,825 indicated in the statement therefore 

includes the operating loss for the year, severance pay for employees, and the capital loss arising from a 

write-down of fixed assets. Certain aspects of the business have been assumed by the Timber Board, 

where the 1957 surplus amounted to $500,000. While this figure is lower than in the previous year, 

because of reduced lumber prices and difficult market conditions, it is worthwhile noting that the 

Board's operations were sustained at a very high level. A special effort was put forward to maintain 

employment and payrolls in the forest products industry. 

 

Saskatchewan Guarantee and Fidelity, which operates primarily as a re-insurance concern with world-

wide connections, also incurred a deficit in 1957. The Company's experience reflected the adverse trend 

of the general insurance industry throughout the world, particularly in the way of auto-claim and crop-

hail losses. In Canada itself it is estimated that the underwriting losses of all fire and general casualty 

companies jumped from $40 million in the previous year up to between $60 and $70 million. Net 

earnings of the Saskatchewan Government Insurance Office for the year amounted to $173,000 so that 

the overall results of our insurance operations remained favourable. 

 

The losses of the two companies noted may be set against the total surplus of $997,537 achieved by the 

remaining companies, not including Power and Telephones. The net result for this group of smaller 

companies was a return of $758,283 on advances of $9,707,000. This represents a dividend of 7.81 per 

cent to the Treasury for the year. It may also be noted that the companies paid a sum of $727,000 in 

royalties to the Government and made grants in lieu of taxes to municipalities of $75,948. Similar 

grants-in-lieu paid by the Power and Telephone Systems totalled $399,000. I am incorporating in the 

printed copy of this address a summary statement of the operating results.

FISCAL YEARS 1956-57 and 1957-58 

 

The 1956-57 Public Accounts have been tabled. They show revenues of $104,277,535, expenditures 

amounting to $98,243,042 and a surplus of $6,034,439. This is the sixteenth successive fiscal period that 

the province has reported a revenue account surplus. The surplus figure for 1956-57 does not take into 

account liquor profits of $10,992,638 which were transferred to Treasury and applied to capital account 

expenditures. 

 

Before considering the present fiscal year, I think I should point out that these are the last public 

accounts which will report on the finances of the province using revenue and capital accounts. 

Henceforth, revenues and expenditures will be classified and reported an budgetary (those which affect 

net debt) and non-budgetary (those which do not affect net debt). Honourable Members will recall that 

these changes, along with changes in the statements, were discussed in my budget address of last year. A 

monograph outlining, the new system in detail has been prepared and will be tabled. It is a pleasure to 

report that the change-over to the new system has been made with a minimum of disruption. I am 

confident that next year, when the present transition 



 

February 28, 1958

period is over, and we have the new basis in effect for comparative purposes with the previous year, 

their value will be apparent to all. 

 

I wish now to place before the House the comparative balance sheets of April 1st, 1957 and Decanter 

31st, 1957. 

 

(See Page 12 of Budget Speech) 

 

This statement shows that the operations for the year to date have been favourable and that the net debt 

of the province has been reduced by $7,134,625 to $31,861,025 as at December 31st, 1957. I am not 

attempting in this statement to make any comparison with previous years, as similar statements are not 

yet available. As a matter of interest, however, and to facilitate transition to the new system, I have 

included a debt statement on the former basis. This shows that the net debt as at December 31st, 1957, 

was $51,673,347. The reason for the lower debt figure using the new accounting method is that cash as 

well as certain advances for working capital, school loans and other purposes are treated as assets, while 

the former system paid no attention to these assets.

A year ago, in the budget you approved, provision was made to reduce the net debt by $3,600,000. 

During the year, substantial over-expenditures have been incurred by several departments. The largest 

amounts are for the Hospital Plan and for highway and grid road construction. A new scale of 

allowances has led to some over-expenditure in Social Welfare. Estimates for the Department of 

Education have also proved to be low. Supplementary estimates are, of course, being presented to cover 

these and other items. 

 

Fortunately, however, all major revenues, with the exception of payments under The Tax Sharing 

Arrangements Act, are running well ahead of original estimates. It is expected that these increases will 

more than compensate for over-expenditures. I am therefore confident that once again we shall end the 

current fiscal period with a substantial surplus of budgetary revenues over budgetary expenditures. 

 

In my last budget address I referred to the sharp rise in interest rates. This trend continued until 

September, at which time there was a levelling off, but only after the bank rate had risen to a level of 

4.33% and the yield on ninth Victory Loan Bonds maturing in 1966 had risen to as high as 4.88%. 

 

As indicated a year ago, it has been necessary to borrow $50,00,000 for Power and Telephones during 

the current fiscal period. We had already obtained $15,750,000 in advance. Despite the extremely tight 

money market, the balance required has been successfully raised, and in addition we have borrowed 

$25,000,000 for the construction program in 1958. The following table indicates the bonds sold during 

the present fiscal year:

During the year, all debentures and treasury bills have been paid off as they became due. Provisions 

have now been completed whereby the maturities in 1959 and 1960, which amounted to the very large 

sum of $27,000,000 and for which practically no sinking funds have been established, will be retired 

without the necessity of refunding any portion. Through prior redemptions the amount actually coming 

to maturity has been reduced to $14,200,000, for the retirement

Because of the higher interest rates during the past year, the average interest rate on our outstanding 

debentures has increased to 3.78% and will undoubtedly be higher at the end of the present fiscal year. 

You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that estimates for the current year contemplated budgetary revenues of 

$119,867,080 budgetary expenditures of $116,231,250, and a budgetary surplus of $3,635,830. The 

budget for the fiscal year beginning next April 1st is based on estimated revenues of $131,547,000. 

Budgetary expenditures are estimated at $130,004,230, leaving a surplus of $1,542,770 to meet non-

budgetary payments. To compare expenditures for the two years, however, it is necessary to add to the 

1958-59 figure an amount of $5,300,000, representing the estimated federal reimbursement on hospital 

insurance. The increase in proposed expenditures over the current year would then be in the order of 

$19,000,000. 

 

The non-budgetary section of our accounts contains those transactions which do not affect the net debt. 

In 1958-59 the non-budgetary payments proposed will exceed $78,000,000. Of this amount, almost 

$68,000,000 required for loans and advances to the Saskatchewan Power Corporation end Government 

Telephones, will be financed by borrowing.

That we can now confidently plan to raise a sum of this magnitude is a tribute to the excellent financial 

health of this province. It clearly indicates the high esteem in which Saskatchewan securities are held by 

investors. 

 

The remaining non-budgetary items, including sinking fund payments, debt retirement, and other loans 

and advances, total $10,409,000. The cash required for these items will be obtained from non-budgetary 

receipts of from the budgetary surplus and from existing cash balances. Honourable Members will, I am 

sure, appreciate that these three sources of financing are available only because of following prudent 

financial policies in the past. If such policies had not been followed, additional borrowings of almost ten 

and a half million dollars would be required. 

 

Under our now system of accounting, the overall effect of the 1958-59 budget is immediately apparent. 

As shown in the "Budget Summary" which is included in the printed copy of my address, it is expected 

that the operations of the new fiscal year will further reduce the net debt by $1,542,770. Apparent, too, 

is the effect on our cash position: implementation of the new budget will reduce existing cash balances 

by $6,319,430. 

 

In tabling the estimates, I would draw your attention to another change which has been made this year. 

From time to time members on both sides of the House have suggested that more detailed information 

be presented for Committee of Supply. An attempt is made in these estimates to provide such material. I 

would appreciate hearing the views of Honourable Members on this change. 

 

I should like now, Mr. Speaker, to outline our estimated revenues for the coming year in some detail. 

The overall figure of $131,547,000 reflects, perhaps better than any other index, the new economic 

stature of the province. 

 

It is significant, I think, that payments from the Federal Government constitute a smaller percentage of 

our total revenues. The estimates upon which they are based have also proven to be very unreliable. In 

December, 1956, the Federal Government of the day claimed that under its new tax-sharing system, 

payments to Saskatchewan in 1957-58 would rise to $36,000,000, an increase of more than $6,000,000 

over the previous year. At that time I expressed some scepticism over the accuracy of the estimate, and 

pointed out that in any case a continuation of the former tax-rental system would have provided us with 

well over $31,000,000. When the federal budget for the year was brought down, it showed that our 

scepticism had been fully justified — the estimated payment to Saskatchewan had been reduced to 

$34,600,000. We are now told that we can expect only $33,000,000 this year, and even that figure may 

be high. 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

14 
 

In forecasting the payments for 1958-59, therefore, we think it unwise to rely upon the figures made 

public in Ottawa, particularly since, as the House will recall, even these had to be changed within two 

days of the first announcement by the federal Minister of Finance. In the alternative, the only reasonably 

reliable estimate to use would appear to be the minimum guaranteed under the Act. This is 95 per cent of 

whatever payment is received this year, and would therefore mean about $31,000,000. To this may be 

added the $3,500,000 increase, announced so abruptly just five weeks ago, yet as our revenue estimates 

clearly show, this latest development does no more than restore our finances to the position we thought 

we had achieved in the budget of one year ago. It does nothing to assist us in planning further expansion 

of program or further grants to local government jurisdictions. 

 

Happily, our own revenues are founded on factual expectation. The largest single item is mineral 

revenues. This is an amazing story, Mr. Speaker — from $232,000 in 1944-45 to an estimated 

$25,000,000 in 1958-59. All items are up considerably except for quartz royalties. The $1 1/4 million 

expected decrease from this source is due, of course, to the world-wide fall in prices of copper and zinc. 

 

The estimated return from the Education and Hospitalization Tax for 1958-59 is $18,500,000. At first 

sight this appears to be a sizeable increase. However, returns for both 1956-57 and the current year will 

run considerably higher than our estimates. 

 

Substantial increases are also expected for gasoline tax and motor vehicle licenses, which are estimated 

at $18,000,000 and $6,500,000 respectively. Last year's tax change has apparently not restricted 

consumption. Gasoline sales are still climbing. The vehicle population also continues to increase. 

Thanks to the rapidly improving condition of Saskatchewan's highways and roads, we feel confident in 

estimating an additional $1,700,000 for gas tax and $500,000 for motor vehicle licences. 

 

A new revenue item appears under the title of Saskatchewan Government Telephones dividend. This 

amount, representing the expected net earnings for 1958, is included to permit more uniform accounting 

and revenue sharing in the Trans-Canada Telephones System, of which the company is a member. Its 

treatment as a budgetary revenue means that we must borrow that much more for the company. 

However I can assure you that Saskatchewan Government Telephones debentures of an amount 

equivalent to or exceeding the profit figure will be purchased each year by government funds.

Before examining detailed expenditures Mr. Speaker, we need first to consider our policy objectives. 

This Government is dedicated to improving the welfare of the people of Saskatchewan. This was our 

goal in 1944; it has been our goal each year since; it is still our goal today. 

 

More specifically, the objectives of this budget are six-fold: to further educational opportunity in the 

province; to improve and diversify our basic agricultural industry; to stimulate economic growth and 

resource development; to and extend Saskatchewan's leadership in the fields of health and to lighten the 

financial burden borne by local government; and finally, to do everything possible to maintain the 

economy at a high level and alleviate the threat of unemployment. 

 

I first turn to our budgetary proposal for the Department of Education. The rising cost of education 

continues to be one of the most urgent problems facing governments today. In keeping with our pledge 

to enlarge school grants as revenues become available, we are proposing to add to the increase of $4.4 

million provided in 1957 a further boost of almost $3,400,000. This provision will raise the total figure 

for school grants in 1958-59 to $20,000,000. Under this program the province's share of total local 

school costs is expected to reach almost 40 per cent. 

 

The size of school grants so overshadows other provincial expenditures on education that there is a 

tendency to forget them. The total budget for the department next year will be just under $26,500,000 

with increases other than school grants amounting to $700,000. For example, additions to the already 

lengthy list of free textbooks and readers which are provided by the province will require an increase of 

roughly two-thirds over the amount spent this year. Total expenditures for this purpose will rise to 

$465,000 in 1958-59. 

 

Provision is also made in this budget for the establishment of the proposed provincial technical institute. 

We have now reached the stage where a beginning can be made on the physical plant required. 

 

As Honourable Members are well aware, enrolment at the University of Saskatchewan is rising and the 

University must continue to expand to keep pace with the growing demand for its services. Total 

provincial assistance to the University will reach $4,000,000 in 1958-59. This includes 1 1/2 million for 

new buildings and it is anticipated that this same capital amount will be required for each of the next two 

years. 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

16 
 

Despite the relatively recent need for such development as technical training, agriculture remains our 

foremost industry. Needless to say, the health of this industry has always been a major concern of this 

Government and the budget presented today reflects in many ways the influence of the work of the 

Royal Commission on Agriculture and Rural Life and its many recommendations for improving rural 

conditions. But as Honourable Members well know, and as the reports of that Commission clearly show, 

the key problems in the farmers' struggle to secure a decent standard of income lie primarily beyond the 

control of the province. Our role is necessarily limited, in the main, to improving rural services and 

assisting in the expansion of production. A whole range of government activities, including increasing 

aid for local schools, expanded rural road and highway programs, and broad health and welfare 

measures contribute directly to the welfare of the farmer and his family. The work of the Department of 

Agriculture itself is primarily directed toward assisting in production problems, and the proposed vote 

for the department is raised by some 10 per cent this year to a total of $5,511,670. 

 

The principal new development attests to the Government's concern over the continued rising cost of 

farm machinery. We now have the necessary staff available to permit full establishment of an 

Agricultural machinery Administration. In 1958-59 this new service will require over $100,000. The 

Administration will implement regulations for the protection of the farmer and will carry out tests to 

help the farmer in the selection and operation of his machinery. 

 

A considerable expansion is provided for the agricultural representative and farm management extension 

services. This was an important recommendation of the Royal Commission, and the budget provides 

some $569,000 for this basic work in the next fiscal year. 

 

Over the past two years the reduced moisture conditions have enabled a changed emphasis in our 

program of capital development for agricultural lands. Expenditures on drainage have been reduced. The 

overall capital budget is up substantially, however, through raising the proposed expenditures on forage 

and pasture development to over half a million dollars. 

 

The uncertainty of grain markets and prices has accentuated the need to diversify our agriculture through 

expanded livestock production. A total increase of $385,000 for the development and operation of 

forage projects and community pastures will be spent in 1958-59 as part of a many-sided program to 

foster and improve the livestock industry of the province. Another major advance will be an expanded 

calf-hood vaccination program. It is estimated that our farmers now suffer an annual loss of at least 

$2,500,000 because of Bang's Disease afflicting their livestock. It is hoped that by spending $50,000 

annually over a five year period, this loss can be virtually eliminated. 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

 

17 

Finally let me add a word about the South Saskatchewan River Project. As the Premier indicated, 

considerable progress has been achieved toward reaching an agreement with the Federal Government, 

with a view to an early start on construction. Now I have been charged with (and I quote) "trying to 

change the rules between innings" in these negotiations. Nothing could be further from the truth. So far 

as I am concerned this matter is not a game. It is a very serious business, involving a tremendous 

financial burden upon the province. I should rightly be accused of shirking my responsibilities as 

Provincial Treasurer if I failed to press upon Ottawa in every way possible, Saskatchewan's rightful 

claim to receive financial consideration at least as favourable as that clearly accorded to other provinces 

in Canada. 

 

Having said that, I should add that it is important at this stage not to take any action likely to prejudice 

the discussions with Ottawa, to load them in any direction or attempt to prejudge them. Furthermore, 

even if an agreement is finally signed, sealed and delivered, it is doubtful if the immediate expenditures 

can be very large. For these reasons, no express provision is made in this budget to finance provincial 

obligations in the project. I want to assure the House, however, that we are giving this question the very 

closest study and attention. 

 

Of all the problems of government in a dynamic and forward-looking society, none is more exciting or 

challenging, or as the past few years have so ably demonstrated, more rewarding, than that of 

strengthening the economic structure of the Province through the intelligent use of our resources. This 

budget contains many measures designed to stimulate economic growth and resource development. 

 

The well known story of Saskatchewan's rise as a major producer of petroleum, natural gas, uranium and 

other minerals needs no detailed recounting. This rise is clearly demonstrated by the number and variety 

of new tasks which must be recognized by the Government. Our responsibilities for stimulating, 

assisting and controlling mineral development have expanded to the point where a full department, 

which will spend nearly $1,400,000 in the coming year, is warranted. Increased professional staff is 

required in the Petroleum and Natural Gas Branch to cope with the administration of our exploration and 

production areas. A new geophysical laboratory will be opened in 1958-59 to meet the demands for 

service of the steadily increasing number of oil wells in the province. An expanded mine rescue program 

will be instituted in the Uranium City area. 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

18 
 

The airborne geophysical surveys in the Lac La Ronge area, which proved so successful last year, will 

be continued. Access and development roads, however, provide the key to the opening of the mineral 

treasure-house of our northland. In the last twelve years, we have constructed over 2,500 miles of 

northern roads. Recently the Federal Government announced its intention of participating in the program 

for the next five years. Our plans have, accordingly, been expanded. We are asking the Legislature for 

the gross amount of $3,190,000 for 1958-59, of which the Federal Government says it will contribute 

nearly 50 per cent. Implementation of the whole program will, of course, be contingent upon federal 

action becoming a reality. 

 

Intelligent exploitation of our resources is not enough, however. Even greater stability in our economy 

has been and will be achieved through the development of secondary industry. Reflected in the 1958-59 

budget is a continuation and expansion of those methods of assistance which have proven so successful 

in recent years. We are providing $500,000 in this budget to meet known demands on the Industrial 

Development Fund. 

 

Our own corporations continue to prosper, Mr. Speaker, and, at the same time, are making substantial 

contributions not only to employment but also to resource utilization and the general economy of the 

province. Perhaps the best example of this effect on Saskatchewan's economy is provided by the Power 

Corporation. The tremendous capital expansion of the Corporation is directly responsible for the 

establishment of several new manufacturing plants in the province. In turn, the Corporation's capital 

expansion is due, in large part, to the growth of industrial loads. Assured supplies of low-cost power and 

gas in turn facilitate the establishment of further new industries. 

 

In 1958 the Power Corporation's total new capital requirements will reach the staggering sum of 

$57,000,000. Additional generating units at Saskatoon and Boundary Dam will require more than one-

third of this amount. Another $14,000,000 will be needed for the expansion and improvement of 

transmission and distribution facilities. Expenditures on rural electrification will be maintained at $6 1/4 

million. Finally a total of $16,000,000 will be invested in the provincial natural gas system primarily to 

strengthen and reinforce our vital sources of supply. 

 

Advances to Saskatchewan Government Telephones will reach almost $11,000,000 in 1958-59. The 

major investment results from our participation in the rapidly improving long distance facilities of the 

Trans-Canada Telephone System. Continuing oil and mineral development has strained existing 

facilities within the province. Heavy expense is also involved in extending the microwave system to 

various centres in Saskatchewan. 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

 

19 

It is our belief, Mr. Speaker, that a good highway system is not only essential for the pleasure and 

convenience of our citizens and visitors to this province, but it is vital to the growth of our economy. 

Despite the fact that Saskatchewan has the highest ratio of road miles per person in Canada, the overall 

quality of our system now compares favourably with that of any province. Just last summer we had the 

satisfaction of being the first province to complete its section of the Trans-Canada Highway. 

Unfortunately, the Federal Government has thus far refused to agree to our request for an early start on a 

second main inter-provincial route. Nevertheless we propose to take up the slack and will maintain 

expenditures on highways at the peak level reached while the Trans-Canada was under construction. We 

are, therefore, providing for a total appropriation of $25,000,000. Maintaining expenditures at this level 

will enable us to fulfil our pledge of $100 million for highways in less than the five year period 

originally proposed. The vote also includes the expanded cost of assistance to urban centres for streets 

on provincial highway routes. 

 

No review of Saskatchewan highways would be complete without some to the tremendous progress that 

has been made in construction of the market road grid. This budget provides for grants of $3,740,000 to 

assist municipalities in this program. You will recall that the plan as originally conceived foresaw a 

yearly provincial contribution of $2,500,000, representing 50 per cent of the for a ten year period. It is 

now expected that the cost of the complete project will be $60,000,000 rather than the original estimate 

of about $50,000,000. The Provincial Government now plans to make grants, Mr. Speaker, not of 

$25,000,000 or even $30,000,000 but of $36,000,000 for the ten year period. In other words, the 

province has absorbed the total increase in cost and raised its contribution to 60 per cent. Equalization 

grants for other local roads will also be enlarged by $100,000, and the inclusion of other services will 

bring the total amount provided for municipal road assistance in 1958-59 to $5,235,000. 

 

Despite our concentration on local government problems and measurer to strengthen the economy of 

Saskatchewan, care has been taken in the formulation of this budget to ensure that our basic and long-

standing concern, the welfare of the Province's citizens, has not been neglected. The 1958-59 budget 

provides for further advances in health and welfare to maintain Saskatchewan's outstanding leadership in 

Canada in these fields. A gross amount of nearly $50,000,000 will be devoted to the programs of these 

two departments next year. 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

20 
 

The budget continues to emphasize the crucial importance of preventive health. Provincial contributions 

to the health regions will be increased by $150,000 for the next fiscal year. Provision is made for the 

establishment of at least one more health region and general improvement of services in existing 

regions. A most encouraging upsurge of interest has taken place at the local level during the past two 

years. It strongly suggests that within a short time the entire settled area of the province will be covered 

by fully organized health regions providing a high level of basic preventive health services. 

 

Expenditures on our many-sided curative program also continue to rise. For example, an additional 

$112,000 is provided for cancer services, raising the total expenditure on this program to $1,275,000. In 

other provinces, and formerly in this province this cost would be met, if it could be met at all, from the 

pocketbooks of unfortunate individuals. Increased costs of the Hospital Services Plan will require an 

additional provincial contribution of $3.3 million in 1958-59. In this connection, Mr. Speaker, I draw 

attention to the fact that a reimbursement from the Federal Government has been included in the budget 

— with some misgivings as to whether it will actually be forthcoming. Honourable Members will recall 

that the present Federal Government has promised to begin paying such reimbursements on July 1st, 

1958, "after the next session". With our fingers crossed, and allowing for a two month delay before the 

first cheque is actually received, we have estimated that we should receive about $5.3 million in 1958-

59. Although the federal formula calls for a 50 per cent sharing of cost by Ottawa for Canada as a whole, 

the actual share in each province will vary considerably. In our case the federal contribution will only 

amount to about 43 per cent of shareable costs. Moreover, important expense elements in our hospital 

plan such as administration and depreciation costs, are not recognized at all by the federal scheme. 

 

Provision has also been made for matching the recognition by the Federal Government that hospital 

construction costs have risen drastically in recent years. An increase of $250,000 in grants to hospitals 

for construction purposes is included in the budget. 

 

Striking evidence of government's concern for people is shown in the program, for the care of the 

mentally ill. In recent years there has been a awakening of public interest in this problem, and I think we 

can rightfully claim that Saskatchewan has been giving the lead to all other provinces in the 

improvement of mental health services. It is noteworthy that in 1955, the last year for which 

comparative expenditure data assembled by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics are available, provincial 

government payments for operating mental institutions amounted to $3.38 per capita for Canada as a 

whole. Quebec 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

 

21 

and the Maritime provinces were much below this level; Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba only slightly 

above. But Saskatchewan led all provinces in providing almost twice the national average expenditure 

— $6.65 per capita. 

 

In the budget for 1958-59 the total sum provided not only for operating our institutions, but also for 

capital improvements, preventive clinics, research programs and other services will exceed $10,000,000. 

This works out at over $11.80 per capita. Over $1,200,000 is provided this year for modernization and 

improvement of our hospital facilities. There is also an increase of $750,000 to secure additional 

professional staff to expand social work facilities for the re-establishment of patients in their home 

environments, and to extend the number of full-time mental health clinics. Despite the rapid growth of 

the program, I fully realize that a great deal remains to be done. It must be recognized, however, that 

more rapid progress can only be achieved within the limits imposed by available financial resources and 

the multitude of alternative competing demands. 

 

In welfare services, the principal increase will be in the area of public assistance payments. We welcome 

recent federal action in raising allowances under various categorical programs and the small concession 

made with respect to the cost of unemployment relief. At the same time, the province's contributions to 

all public assistance programs, including mothers' allowances, old age pensions, and free health services, 

will rise by more than $1,000,000 in the new fiscal year. 

 

A final group for which special recognition has been made in this budget includes the aged, the 

chronically ill and handicapped. An additional $225,000 for the operation of provincial geriatric centres, 

bringing the total amount to $1,350,000 is evidence of the magnitude of the problem of ageing and 

chronic illness. These problems must receive increasing attention as the percentage of our population in 

the upper age bracket steadily increases. An amount is also included, therefore, to begin a 

comprehensive long-range study in this field. Restoration of the physically handicapped to useful places 

in society is another growing program which is reflected in our plans for 1958-59. An additional 

$100,000 for rehabilitation services and for physical restoration centres has been provided in this budget. 

 

In reviewing the expenditure highlights, no specific reference has been made to the financial status of 

school units and municipalities. The province's indispensable partner in improving the welfare of the 

people of Saskatchewan is, of course, local government. As the Premier has formally declared, the 

Government of this province accepts, as an article of democratic faith, the need for strong and effective 

local administration. Until the Continuing Committee has reported and until we are in a position to 

develop a sound organizational structure, however, a realistic strengthening of local financial resources 

is most difficult. In the interim, recognizing 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

22 
 

existing financial problems, this budget provides for further substantial increases in aid to local 

government. 

 

It will be recalled that at the Local Government Conference of December, 1956, the Province committed 

itself to provide additional aid, largely on the expectation of higher federal payments under the tax-

sharing arrangements. Our own commitment was made good in the budget one year ago. But as I have 

already mentioned, the federal contributions have fallen far short or the amounts first indicated. 

Moreover, prospects for a significant improvement in 1958-59 are very poor indeed. We can only hope, 

Mr. Speaker, that if and when a federal budget is at last presented to Parliament, it will reveal a more 

realistic appreciation of the financial needs of the municipalities, and other local jurisdictions. 

 

Let me summarize the highlights of our own budget, reflecting an increase this year of more than 

$6,000,000 in further aid to local government. Higher school grants total almost $3.4 million. The vote 

for the Municipal Road Assistance Authority is raised by more than $1.3 million. Expenditure by the 

province on social aid and public assistance will cost an additional $954,000. Further expenditures in 

health regions and additional health services for public assistance cases will total $260,000. Increases in 

other forms of assistance to local government, e.g., administration of local improvement districts, 

municipal medical care grants, and so forth, will amount to over $600,000. 

 

It is of interest to consider not only the yearly increase in assistance to local government, but also the 

total amount provided for this purpose in the 1958-59 budget. Education grants, public assistance and 

expenditures on the market road grid total $32 million dollars. Other kinds of assistance to local 

jurisdictions amount to $10 million. This Government has reason to be proud that out of a budget of 

$130,000,000 almost one-third, or $42,000,000 will be spent during 1958-59 in directly assisting our 

local institutions. 

 

A statement of provincial aid to local government would hardly be complete without some mention of 

services now provided at the provincial level which were, until recently, local responsibilities in 

Saskatchewan and which are, in some provinces, still supported as local responsibilities. I am referring 

to services such as our Hospital Plan. If this service can be considered as indirect aid to local 

government, and quite frankly, I believe it can, then a further budgetary expenditure of $16.6 million can 

well be added to the $42,000,000 of direct provincial assistance to local governments in 1958-59. This is 

a total of almost $59 million. 

 

A particularly vexing problem of some local government units is that of capital financing. In recognition 

of this, I announced at the Local Government Conference in December, 1956, our intention to assist 

local governments by purchasing debentures from those units 



 

February 28, 1958 

 

 

23 

encountering real difficulty in capital borrowing. The effects of that policy can now be for a full year. 

The table which is included in the printed address indicates that the Province bought one bond of every 

five issued by local governments in 1957. For school units, provincial purchases accounted for almost 

45 per cent of the amount issued. This kind of provincial assistance cannot be overlooked when 

assessing the overall aid given to local government in Saskatchewan. I may add, as well, that the 

Government is giving very serious study to the recommendation by the Royal Commission on 

Agriculture and Rural Life that steps be taken to establish an effective capital financing authority for the 

larger school units.

This budget has been formulated, Mr. Speaker, under the lengthening shadows of unemployment and 

with uncertainty over future economic conditions. In the past few months it has become increasingly 

apparent that unemployment is a national problem which requires national remedies, and that preventive 

measures are preferable to and much less costly than remedial steps. Honourable Members will recall 

Saskatchewan's concern, last expressed at the 1955 Federal-Provincial Conference, over the willingness 

of the former Federal Government to abandon fiscal policy an a necessary tool in maintaining full 

employment. Unfortunately, the change in government in Ottawa has not produced a change in this 

approach.

Throughout the entire post-war period, public and private investment has been a strategic dynamic factor 

in maintaining a high level of employment for our citizens. To compensate for the general slow-down in 

private investment, a conscious attempt has been made in this budget to provide projects which will 

combat unemployment in Saskatchewan. The importance of public projects in relation to employment is 

considerable; it is expected that capital expenditures by agencies of the Provincial Government will 

constitute about 20 per cent of the total capital investment in the province in 1958. The gross budgets for 

new investment and replacement expenditures for the Power Corporation and Government Telephones 

alone all exceed $70,000,000. 

 

Other proposed capital expenditures will have a similar beneficial effect on the economy. Budgetary 

capital expenditures for 1958-59 will total almost $26,000,000 compared with $20,700,000 for the 

current year. Expenditures on highways, grid roads and public works are particularly effective in 

producing jobs for Saskatchewan citizens. The Public Works budget of $8,800,000, higher than last year 

by $2,325,000 is almost wholly of a job-creating nature. Projects like the provincial laboratory in Regina 

and the Saskatoon court house, which have gone forward through this winter, have helped to keep 

unemployment in Saskatchewan lower than elsewhere in Canada. Similar projects for 1958-59 include 

the Health and Welfare building in Regina, completion of the Saskatoon court house, an extension to the 

new boys' school, a hospital in Lac la Ronge and, in the budgets of our crown corporations, a million 

dollar telephone warehouse in Regina and a variety of other buildings in the smaller cities and towns. 

Not without its effects, particularly in rural centres, is the impetus given to municipal works through 

provincial purchase of local debentures. In many cases the provincial purchase spells the difference 

between proceeding with or abandoning a project. 

 

The budget I have just presented, Mr. Speaker, seems to me to throw particular stress upon a very 

important aspect of public affairs in Canada today. This is the growing inter-dependence and the need 

for co-ordinated effort among all three levels of government. Within Saskatchewan we are continually 

seeking to improve our relationships with local government, the better to serve the people both of our 

individual communities and the province at large. I think we can honestly claim an encouraging measure 

of success. It is abundantly clear, however, that provincial-local action is critically influenced by, and 

dependent upon, the whims of the national government. Nowhere is this more evident than in our 

attempts to contribute to full employment. The Saskatchewan Government is anxious to co-operate in 

every way possible with Ottawa in overcoming the present troubled and potentially dangerous situation. 

But the country as a whole is greatly in need of more dynamic co-operative leadership and vigorous 

action from the national government.

This is what we mean by social planning. This is surely the key to maintaining full employment and 

prosperity for all of Canada. 

 

Because our budget contributes to this objective within Saskatchewan, I am confident that it will receive 

the approval of the citizens of this province.

Bill No. 55 — An Act to amend The Exemption Act 

 

Hon. Mr. Walker (Attorney General): —Mr. Speaker, this amendment is a replacement of Section 6 

and Section 7 of the Exemptions Act. As hon. members know, The Exemptions Act exempts from 

seizure under execution, certain property belonging to a person, and that includes the home when 

occupied by the debtor. It also includes the home when occupied by the wife or family of the deceased 

debtor, but through a defect, a technical defect in the wording of the section which is the same as the 

section in the Alberta Act, a rather unfortunate case arose in the province of Alberta in December of last 

year, where when the debtor died and the execution was levied against the property of the deceased. The 

Exemptions Act no longer gave the widow the protection, although if the claim had been made after his 

death, the estate would have had the protection. This is an amendment which is designed to cover up that 

technical defect in the Act, and it is therefore proposed to make it retroactive to the first day of 

December, 1957. This will not change any decided cases in this province, but it will give protection in 

this province to an people who might lose their protection as a result of that decision given in Alberta on 

December 1st. There is no desire to allow someone to take advantage of the technicality simply because 

of the result of that Alberta case, and with those words, Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of the Bill. 

 

The question being put, it was agreed to.

Bill No. 56 — An Act to amend The Power Corporation Act 

 

Hon. Russell Brown (Min. Saskatchewan Power Corporation): — Mr. Speaker, this Bill only 

provides one very short amendment to The Power Corporation Act. It is designed to provide an increase 

in the borrowing authority of the Corporation, and that is necessary, of course, in view of the fact that 

the Provincial Treasurer (Hon. Mr. Fines) just mentioned that it will be necessary to borrow some $57 

million for the Corporation this year. There may be some questions in connection with the present 

position of past borrowings, but I think those can be well dealt with in committee, and I would therefore 

move second reading of this Bill. 

 

The question being put, it was agreed to. 

 

The Assembly then adjourned at 5:30 o'clock p.m.
