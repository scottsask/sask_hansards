NOTICES OF MOTIONS AND QUESTIONS 
 

Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I give notice that I 
shall on day no. 17 ask the government the following question: 

 
To the Minister of Justice: in 1995, an Alberta group 
known as the Fort McMurray Youth Outreach Centre 
operated a vacation resort for business people in 
north-western Saskatchewan, attempted to access public 
funds by claiming to be operating a camp for 
underprivileged youth. A criminal investigation was started 
because of allegations that the group fraudulently claimed 
to be a charitable organization when in fact it was a 
business. Has there been any successful prosecutions 
arising from this case; what steps have been taken to 
ensure that this type of operation will not be attempted 
again; what happened to the assets of this operation; and 
how were they dispersed? 

 
I so present, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I give notice that 
I shall on day no. 17 ask the government the following 
question: 
 

Given that the proposed new review section 50.1 of The 
Education Act regulations states that, and I quote: “an 
allegation of discrimination pursuant to the Human Rights 
Code or the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms” 
cannot be a basis for the placement of a pupil, where do 
parents and children go who have legitimate human rights 
and Canadian charter rights issues? 

 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I give notice that I 
shall on day no. 17 ask the government the following question 
of the Minister of Justice: 
 

How many applications for assistance and/or board 
hearings are presently in the possession of the Surface 
Rights Arbitration Board; how many applications have 
been dealt with in each of the past five years; how many 
applications have been on the books unsettled for more 
than one year; what is the average length of time between 
the receipt of an application and the resolution (a) by 
private, negotiated settlement; or (b) by board hearings? 
 

I so present. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
This is a kind of an in-house statement of particular interest to 
members, legislative staff, and visitors, and of general interest 
to all Saskatchewan people who like to see one of our own 
excel. 
 
Those of us who dine in the legislative cafeteria no doubt have 
noticed . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. It’s introduction of guests. Was 
the Provincial Secretary wishing to be recognized for 
introduction of guests? Yes, recognize the Provincial Secretary 
for introduction of guests. 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you. I was on the members’ 



March 24, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 249 

statements, which I’ll get to in a moment . . . (inaudible 
interjection) . . . That’s right, one at a time. 
 
I want to introduce Trent Brears and Pam Poitras, and as I think 
many members of the House will not be unaware, I’ll have 
more to say on these two later on under members’ statements. 
 
But now I know the House will want to join me in welcoming 
them. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It gives me great 
pleasure to introduce to you and through you to the members of 
this House, two individuals from the community of Waldheim 
in my constituency, Russell Willems and Corey Adrian. I’d ask 
them to stand. They’re both avid watchers of political events 
throughout this province. Let’s give them a good welcome to 
this legislature. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Osika: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would also ask the 
Assembly to help me welcome 12 grade 12’s from White Calf 
Collegiate in the beautiful community of Lebret, who are here 
seated in your gallery; and they’re accompanied by their 
teacher, Darlyne Hoberg. And they’re here to watch the 
proceedings and I’ll be meeting with them shortly after question 
period. Thank you. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Alongside my 
colleague from Melville I also want to take the opportunity to 
welcome the aboriginal students that are here today. I think it’s 
very important to take advantage of opportunities such as this to 
see how the Assembly works. And being an aboriginal person 
myself, I’m quite pleased to see that. And I eventually hope that 
many of you come along and occupy some of these seats in the 
near future because that’s certainly part of our effort to establish 
ourselves as an aboriginal people in this province. Thank you 
very much. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Mr. Speaker, I’m also pleased today 
to welcome 14 students from SIAST (Saskatchewan Institute of 
Applied Science and Technology), the Wascana Institute, 
enrolled in employability skills training program. They’re 
accompanied by their teacher Jack Mitchell, and I’ll look 
forward to meeting with these people at 2:30 in 218. I’d ask all 
members to join me in welcoming them. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 

Precipitators added to Boundary Dam 
 
Mr. Ward: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday the Minister 
of Environment and Resource Management announced on 
behalf of the Minister of CIC (Crown Investments Corporation 
of Saskatchewan), a $66 million investment to reduce 

particulate emissions at Boundary dam station, power station, 
through the installation of electrostatic precipitators. 
 
A memorandum of understanding between SaskPower and the 
Department of the Environment and Resource Management has 
put in place long-term initiatives as part of an action plan which 
commits to the goal of a sustainable environment. The 
electrostatic precipitators will remove up to 99 per cent of 
particulate emissions from the stacks of the coal-fired plant. 
 
Through a competitive tender, ABB Power has been awarded 
the contract to design, manufacture, install, and commission the 
first of five precipitators. The remaining four will be added at a 
rate of one per year, providing further job creation and 
additional economic benefits. 
 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the minister responsible for 
Environment and Resource Management said: 
 

This agreement and the lead initiative will go a long way 
towards creating economic benefits while helping to pass 
on a clean, safe and sustainable environment to future 
generations. 

 
This government is committed to environmental issues and we 
will continue to do so. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

National Cadet Biathlon Champions 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise in the House today and recognize No. 
2815 Naicam Legion Army Cadet Corps, which has represented 
the province at the National Cadet Biathlon competition for the 
past four years. 
 
To reach this level of competition, these cadets qualified as one 
of the top six teams at the Saskatchewan Army Cadet Corps 
biathlon, and then competed at the Tri-service biathlon where 
top teams from the Army, Navy, and Air Cadet Corps competed 
and advanced to the nationals. 
 
This year the ladies’ teams of cadets Louise Weber, Helen 
Meekins, and Jackie Kellington brought home gold medals for 
the aggregate, which is the combined times in sprint and 
individual races; gold in relay; gold in the overall aggregate 
team awards, which is the combined times of each member in 
the 5-kilometre sprint, 6-kilometre individual relay, and 
6-kilometre team patrol competition. Cadet Weber also won a 
bronze medal for the Individual. 
 
Also competing at this competition was a composite team of 
two males and two females consisting of cadets Tracy 
Brechbuel from La Ronge, Jennifer Griffith from Naicam, 
Colty Reschny from Saskatoon, and Allan Knights from Moose 
Jaw. They finished fourth in the relay. 
 
The male team was represented by 889 La Ronge Air Cadets. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to extend 
congratulations to these cadets as well as to their coaches, Capt. 
Scott Ponath and Cadet Leader Maria Leonard, for their hard 



250 Saskatchewan Hansard March 24, 1998 

work and success at the Nationals. 
 

Lloydminster School Construction Project 
 

Ms. Stanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. In last Thursday’s 
wonderful budget, which the members of the Tory Party are 
afraid to debate, the Minister of Finance announced a 43 per 
cent increase in school capital funding. The Minister of 
Education has agreed to spend a portion of it in Lloydminster. 
 
As the minister said, we are committed to securing the future of 
the province by investing in Saskatchewan children and youth. 
The minister also said, and here I am quoting, Mr. Speaker, I 
am quoting the minister, so I can’t be accused of being partisan: 
 

“. . . over the past few years the vibrant community of 
Lloydminster has experienced economic growth and 
corresponding enrolment growth in both school systems. 

 
That’s my town, Mr. Speaker, growing and vibrant. 
 
Three new projects have been announced. A new public 
elementary school, construction to begin this year; a new gym, 
additional classrooms, science and music areas for Father 
Gorman Elementary School, also to be done this year; the 
approval for the planning design of a new high school for the 
separate school system, construction to begin in ’99 — just in 
time for the new century. 
 
We, Mr. Speaker, are committed to providing all our students 
with safe and well-equipped learning environments. These 
announcements are a good start. No wonder the Tories don’t 
want to talk about the budget. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Dene High School Hosts Regional Wrestling Competition 
 
Mr. Belanger: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to report to the Assembly today that the Dene High 
School in La Loche hosted a successful regional wrestling 
tournament for the Saskatchewan High Schools Athletic 
Association. Dene High School welcomed 17 schools and 
approximately 170 participants and coaches from places all 
around Saskatchewan. 
 
Half of the participants came the day before to take part in the 
Dene High School’s Culture Day. Culture Day is an important 
part of the year for the Dene students, and as always it was a 
great success. The day was full of activities ranging from ice 
fishing to snowshoeing, and concluded with Dene songs and 
old-time dances. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this day is especially important for promoting the 
uniqueness of the Dene culture to the tournament’s visitors. 
Saturday’s tournament was an excellent display of skill, 
training, and sportsmanship by the athletes and their coaches. 
The crowd was treated to a fine show of competition. Dene 
High School athletes were very successful in their matches and 
they will be sending eight wrestlers to the provincial 
competition on March 27, 28 here in Regina. 

I would like to congratulate the eight Dene High School athletes 
who were successful, as well as all the participants who made 
the weekend tournament a success. I know that Dene High 
School and La Loche did an excellent job in representing 
northern Saskatchewan, and it’s just one more example of the 
many good happenings in the North. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Culinary Team Saskatchewan 
 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
As I began to say with such enthusiasm, if not an exquisite 
sense of timing, those of us who dine in the legislative cafeteria 
have noticed a delicious difference in the menu of late. We’ve 
gone from having meals which one might say are befitting for 
MLAs (Member of the Legislative Assembly) to meals befitting 
a king and a queen. 
 
In no small measure, this culinary change is the responsibility 
of Mr. Trent Brears, who’s now the chef for the legislative food 
services. I think I speak for all of us when I say we’re delighted 
to have him here. And I think we’re delighted as well that the 
world outside the Legislative Building is beginning to learn of 
his talent, although all of us may have reason to fear the results. 
 
Trent was the team captain of Culinary Team Saskatchewan at 
the Eighth Annual Inter-provincial Culinary Arts Competition 
held in Saskatoon the weekend before last. Teams from western 
Canada and from Quebec were competing for the top prize, 
with the ultimate goal of winning a spot on the Canadian 
Olympic team. I’m happy to report that Team Saskatchewan 
won silver in the hot kitchen competitions and gold in the cold. 
No one here will be surprised to hear that Trent himself had the 
highest score for his cold platter. 
 
I ask all members to join with me in congratulating Mr. Trent 
Brears. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation and 
University of Saskatchewan Collaborate On New Atlas 

 
Mr. Whitmore: — Mr. Speaker, I want to mention a 
collaboration between a division of Saskatchewan Property 
Management Corporation and the University of Saskatchewan 
that will benefit the scientific and educational community — a 
small, specific, technical example of how this government is 
cooperating with any number of groups to advance our 
province. 
 
The geomatics division of SPMC (Saskatchewan Property 
Management Corporation) has entered into an agreement with 
the University of Saskatchewan to develop a new atlas of 
Saskatchewan — a book of maps, charts, that will assist any 
number of students and researchers in a number of different 
ways. 
 
SPMC is providing the university, at no cost, access to certain 
digital products to be used in the production of the atlas. On 
completion, the atlas will be jointly owned by both partners. 
Both will have the distribution rights and both will share in any 



March 24, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 251 

revenue, with most of that going to the university. 
 
The project is progressing on schedule and publication expected 
in 1999. I congratulate all those involved. Mr. Speaker, in 
matters great and small, the people of Saskatchewan and their 
agencies are cooperating to bring us into the new century well 
equipped and knowledgeable. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 

New Bed and Breakfast in Historic Unity House 
 

Ms. Murrell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On January 1, some 
friends of mine purchased a family heirloom of sorts. Murray 
and Joan Haughian bought the Leeson house in Unity. The 
house was ordered out of an Eaton’s catalogue and built by 
Murray’s great-grandfather in 1917. 
 
Murray’s grandparents moved from their farm in the ’20s or 
’30s and the house was left vacant. In 1946 it was purchased 
and moved into Unity. In the 1950s the Leeson house became 
the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) barracks for the 
Unity detachment, which it remained until 1967. Murray says 
there is still a bomb shelter in the basement from the 
Diefenbaker days. The house has changed hands at least four 
times since then. And in 1991, Murray and Joan bought the 
house Murray’s great-grandfather built. 
 
With all the history of the house, Murray and Joan thought it 
would make an ideal bed and breakfast. Family members 
decided to call the new venture with an old history, the Leeson 
House Bed and Breakfast. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Murray and Joan Haughian and 
others like them for finding new ways to enhance 
Saskatchewan’s heritage and economy. Mr. Speaker, if you go 
to Unity this fall to speak to students, may I suggest you call the 
Leeson House Bed and Breakfast. The hospitality will be 
gracious. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 

Inquiry into Channel Lake 
 

Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 
questions this afternoon are for the minister responsible for 
CIC. Mr. Minister, the calls for a public inquiry are getting 
louder every day. We want a public inquiry; Morris Bodnar 
wants a public inquiry, Jack Messer wants a public inquiry, 87 
per cent of the Leader-Post readers want a public inquiry. Even 
the Liberal member from North Battleford is warming up to the 
idea of a public inquiry. 
 
Mr. Minister, the only people who don’t seem to want a public 
inquiry around here are you. Why not? What are you protecting 
here? What are you hiding? Mr. Minister, will you do the right 
thing and call a public inquiry into this whole fiasco 
surrounding Jack Messer and Channel Lake? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I’m very 
pleased that the member opposite has asked the question 

because in fact we are going to have a public inquiry and it’s 
going to happen right here in the legislature as soon as you want 
to go to work. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I want to say that . . . 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the members opposite that two of 
the main witnesses who we want to come to the committee, and 
I know members from the Liberal caucus would like to 
interview, and I’m sure that if you have the courage you would 
want to interview . . . Mr. Messer said last week, and I quote, “I 
will willingly be there,” referring to the legislative committee, 
about the inquiry. He says there is no reason to force, or by any 
way that he would need to be subpoenaed to come. He’s ready 
to go. 
 
But even more interesting, I have here a letter to the Chair of 
the committee, your desk mate, that I want to read into the 
record if I could, Mr. Speaker. 
 
An Hon. Member: — What’s the date on it? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — The date is March 20. It’s 
addressed to the Chair of the committee. It says: 
 

Dear Ms. Draude: I represent Lawrence . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. Order, order. The time has 
expired. And the hon. member knows that we’re not, the hon. 
member knows that we’re not to use proper names of members, 
but they must be referred to, when in debate in the House, in the 
context of their positions they hold. 
 
Next question. 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Minister, did 
SaskPower, Mr. Minister, did SaskPower, CIC, or your 
department, or Channel Lake ever hire your old buddy, Reg 
Gross, to do any consulting work during that period that 
Channel Lake was owned by SaskPower? Was Reg Gross 
involved in any way in the sales transaction with DEML (Direct 
Energy Marketing Limited)? 
 
Will you table a list of all persons and companies who had 
consulting contracts or any other contracts to do with Channel 
Lake or with SaskPower in regards to the management of 
Channel Lake? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I say to you and 
through you to the members opposite, obviously these kind of 
questions are the very questions that should and will be asked in 
the committee when you have the courage to call Public 
Accounts. 
 
But I want to say again, and go back to the letter that was sent 
to the Chair of Public Accounts dealing with the inquiry that we 
want to have into this issue. And I want to quote: 
 
“Dear Chair,” (and I put in quotes) “Chair of the Committee of 
Public Accounts:” 



252 Saskatchewan Hansard March 24, 1998 

I represent Lawrence Portigal, who has been mentioned as 
a prospective witness before your committee on hearings 
into the disposition by SaskPower of Channel Lake 
Petroleum Ltd. 
 
I am instructed to advise that Mr. Portigal will make 
himself available to your committee upon request. Mr. 
Portigal resides in Calgary and will appreciate if he can 
receive as much notice as possible. 
 

So I say to you, sir, you should ask your desk mate to call the 
committee, and the public inquiry in fact will start. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Minister, we have 
been informed that Reg Gross did do work for DEML related to 
the purchase of Channel Lake from SaskPower. If he was also 
working for SaskPower then he’s playing both sides of the 
fence, as he’s famous for. 
 
This is the kind of information we need to conduct a full 
investigation of Channel Lake. And by withholding that 
information you are showing that the Public Accounts 
Committee just simply cannot work. But you won’t give us the 
information because you know we need it to do the work on this 
project. 
 
Mr. Minister, will you table a list of every person or company, 
including Reg Gross, who have had a consulting contract or any 
other contract with Channel Lake or with SaskPower, CIC, or 
your department. And if you won’t provide that information, 
who are you protecting here? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I say to the member 
opposite, as the Liberals were saying earlier today, the Tory 
Party is not coming clean with the people of Saskatchewan, and 
is not only holding up the business of the House at great 
expense to the taxpayers, but is refusing to call the committee 
that these very questions could be asked — to whom? Could be 
asked to Mr. Portigal, who is ready to appear before the 
committee. 
 
Did Reg Gross work for Mr. Portigal? I’m interested in 
knowing that. Let’s get the committee going so we can find out 
the answer. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Legal Opinions on Channel Lake 
 

Mr. Heppner: — Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister 
of Justice. Mr. Minister, yesterday the Minister for CIC 
admitted that CIC got a legal opinion from your department 
with regards to Channel Lake. What was that legal opinion 
about, what kind of advice did CIC ask for, and will you release 
that legal opinion today? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I say to the member 
opposite, Mr. Speaker, I say to the member opposite who yelled 
. . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. Order, order, order. Now I’ll ask 

for the cooperation from all members of the House, on both 
sides of the House. It is getting a bit difficult to hear both the 
question being put and the answer being provided. Order, order. 
And the question was able to clearly be put in an uninterrupted 
way and I’ll for cooperation to permit the minister to respond in 
the same fashion. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I say to the members 
opposite that the questions they are asking here will all be 
answered in great detail at the public inquiry that will be held 
by a committee of this legislature. There will be an inquiry, and 
it will start on March 31 as soon as we get confirmation from 
the Chair of the committee that in fact the committee can go to 
work. 
 
But I say to the member opposite, the people that are calling my 
office are saying, when will the Conservatives go back to work? 
They’re on strike in the House, they’re on strike as it relates to 
the committees. And they’re asking me, when will they go back 
to work? That’s the question the people of Saskatchewan are 
asking. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. My question is 
again for the Minister of Justice. Mr. Minister, you had all the 
legal opinions — you had the Gerrand opinion, you had the 
Justice opinion, yet you had to get another one from MLT 
(MacPherson Leslie & Tyerman). Why? What was wrong with 
the first two? Don’t you trust your own Department of Justice? 
 
Mr. Minister, the Justice opinion said one of two things. Either 
it said you have to pay Jack Messer severance, which means 
you don’t need another opinion from MLT; or it said you don’t 
have to pay Jack Messer. Which means you went out and 
shopped around until you found a lawyer who would fix Jack 
up for you. Which one is it, Mr. Minister? Why won’t you 
release the Justice opinion, and what are you hiding? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — To the member opposite, in his 
question he asks about the opinion, why we required an opinion 
from McPherson Leslie & Tyerman on the issue, the Rob 
Garden opinion. Let me tell you this again because obviously 
you haven’t listened in the days leading up to this, where I said 
Milt Fair was given the file as it related to the severance of Mr. 
Messer. He engaged MLT to do an opinion, and that’s the 
opinion that you’re referring to. 
 
But the real question again is a Bill that is being considered by 
the member for Regina South, which is a back-to-work 
legislation for the Conservatives in your caucus so we can get 
on with the work of the Assembly. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Heppner: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Minister, the 
other day the Finance minister made about the only honest 
statement we’ve had from the NDP(New Democratic Party) in 
the last two weeks. The statement went as follows: if you asked 
100 different lawyers you’d get 100 different opinions. That’s 
just about what you did, Mr. Minister. You went and shopped 
around to lawyer after lawyer until you finally found one who 
gave you the opinion you wanted. And it turns out he’s the 



March 24, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 253 

attorney of record for DEML, the same company that bought 
Channel Lake. Now isn’t that just a cosy little arrangement. 
 
Mr. Minister, you keep telling us this is a legal issue. Then why 
won’t you release the legal opinions? What are you hiding? Mr. 
Minister, will you stop hiding behind your lame excuses and 
release all the legal opinions today? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, I say to 
the member opposite there’s only one group in this Assembly 
hiding and that’s the Conservative caucus hiding from a 
committee which they chair. Now that’s, that’s . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — This is an interesting, an interesting 
opposition — an interesting opposition that hides in the seats 
here ringing the bells to hide from a committee that they chair. 
Does that make any sense? That’s why the public is very 
confused about why you call yourselves the official opposition. 
 
Now I know how you like doing things in the dark of the night, 
in secret, when you’re putting together this so-called new party, 
but I’ll tell you Channel Lake will be dealt with in a full and 
public inquiry here in the Assembly as soon as you screw up 
your courage to come and chair the committee meeting. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Health Care Funding in Regina 
 

Mr. McLane: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Regina District 
Health Board held an emergency meeting yesterday and guess 
what, Mr. Speaker, what the meeting was about? That’s right, it 
was to discuss the problem that they’ve got of a $5 million 
deficit this coming fiscal year — $5 million. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this NDP government has already cut millions out 
of the health care budget. This NDP government has closed 400 
hospital beds in Regina. This NDP government has forced the 
decision to close the Plains hospital, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Minister of Health should read my lips. Mr. Minister, you 
don’t seem to understand. There is a health care crisis in 
Regina; when will you wake up and listen? And what are you 
going to do to prevent this crisis from further escalating? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I am astounded by the 
comment that the member from Arm River makes because he 
says today that in this province there isn’t enough health care 
funding to deliver the health services across the piece. 
 
This member needs to know that in Saskatchewan today we 
spend $1.72 billion on health care; the largest financial 
contribution to health care in the history of this province — the 
history of this province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Hon. Mr. Serby: — At the same time, at the same time, Mr. 
Speaker, at the same time, Mr. Speaker, we back-filled every 
penny that the federal government has cut across the health 
piece across the country. And all you need to do, Mr. Speaker, 
is have a discussion with his . . . he needs to have a discussion 
with his friends in the Maritimes who today have again said the 
federal government is not putting enough money into the 
budgets of health care in all of the provinces across the nation, 
and in fact have created a huge, huge disparity in health care 
because of their underfunding, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McLane: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The results of the 
NDP cuts to the health care system in Regina should be obvious 
for the government members to see. We have patients and 
stretchers in the hallways of our hospitals; we have a hospital 
bed crisis; and we have waiting-lists that are three times as long 
as was acceptable to the Blakeney government. 
 
Just yesterday the minister told the Assembly, and I quote: 
“There will be no further bed reductions.” The former minister 
of Health, the Minister of Finance, has also said that there will 
be no more bed closures or cuts to the front-line care workers. 
 
Mr. Minister, tell this House, how is the district supposed to 
deal with this massive shortfall of money? And will you step in 
and do whatever you need to do to prevent this? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don’t know 
where the member opposite gets his information from. I know 
that a couple of days ago his colleague and bench mate had 
indicated that there we no beds available in the city of Regina. 
Today the member opposite tells me that the district health 
boards are hugely underfunded and don’t have any new money. 
 
I want to say to the, I want to say to the member opposite that 
this year the district health boards received 30 million more 
new dollars to do their work across the province. Every health 
care district across the province will get an injection of new 
funding — every health care district. 
 
At the same time, Mr. Speaker, there will be additional funding 
for the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Regina. There 
will be additional funding for positions across the country . . . or 
across the province, Mr. Speaker, to the tune of $26 million. 
There will be additional funding to ensure that we have the 
rural, on-call emergency services. There is more money going 
into health, Saskatchewan health funding, in this province than 
ever in the history, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Inquiry into Channel Lake 
 
Mr. Hillson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’ve 
been raising Channel Lake for four months. One member from 
the Saskatchewan Party was good enough to support me. He 
said, and I quote, on February 16: 
 

The issues that Mr. Hillson has raised are exactly the . . . 



254 Saskatchewan Hansard March 24, 1998 

The Speaker: — Order, order. Order. Order. Now the hon. 
member will recognize as well that when referring to other 
members in the House he should be referring to them, not by 
their proper name, but by positions they hold in the House. 
 
Mr. Hillson: — I was reading a direct quote from Hansard. 
 
Unfortunately that same member then turned around and voted 
against adding Channel Lake to the Public Accounts agenda. Of 
course that was the member for Melfort-Tisdale. Then the NDP 
stonewalled me. Now the Chair of the Public Accounts 
Committee calls her own committee a kangaroo court, so I 
don’t know what she’s doing as the Chair of it. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, the Public Accounts Committee has 
to be a real process. And by real process I mean Jack Messer 
has to be the first witness, Portigal, Ben Drummond have to be 
right after, the TV and radio have to have access, solicitor-client 
privilege has to be waived, documents have to be filed. 
 
Will the Premier commit to no more stonewalling, no more 
cover-ups; this is a real process determined to get to the bottom. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Romanow: — Mr. Speaker, the government has 
tabled two reports by Deloitte Touche and CIC in what I think 
has been full revelation of the substantial facts surrounding the 
circumstance. 
 
We’ve also said, the minister in charge, on the first available 
day when the House was reconvened, that we’re prepared to 
refer this to Public Accounts. I have answered already and I’ll 
repeat again, there will be a public inquiry. The list of names of 
people that you have suggested should be listed as evidence . . . 
giving evidence and testimony. We will have no objection. All 
members of this side of the House are prepared to cooperate in a 
full and complete inquiry. 
 
Individual decisions on individual issues which may have a 
legal implication will have to be made by the committee based 
on the legal considerations that are before it. But this is going to 
be a full inquiry, a full public disclosure in the Assembly. It is 
our job. Public Accounts Committee cannot run away with it. 
And for the life of me, I don’t know what the Tories are running 
away from. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Hillson: — Mr. Speaker, the Nerland inquiry of course 
took two years and 2 million bucks. The Liberal opposition not 
only wants to get to the bottom of Channel Lake, we want to get 
to the bottom now, next week. We want to know: why was Jack 
Messer, the old NDP bagman, so in thick with Lawrence 
Portigal, the old Tory bagman? Why was it that after Portigal 
got his $300,000-plus severance, he turned up working for 
Messer? What do these two have in common besides the fact 
they both got over 300 grand from the taxpayers of 
Saskatchewan? 
 
What is the missing link, Mr. Deputy Premier, between these 
two? Why are they so close? Will we be able to review that in 
Public Accounts? 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I say to the member 
opposite again, as I indicated to the Conservative questions 
about the issue of a public inquiry, which we will have, I 
guarantee you we will have here in the Assembly on March 31. 
It’s going to happen and I give you our commitment that 
everything we can do in our power — we will have both Mr. 
Messer and Mr. Portigal here to be interviewed and answer the 
very questions you put. 
 
Why do I know they will be here? Because both of them have 
indicated directly to the Chair of Public Accounts that they’re 
willing to come. The question you raise is a good one. What are 
the Conservatives afraid of from this public inquiry that will be 
held here in the Assembly? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Hillson: — I have raised in this House before and haven’t 
gotten an answer before, we have the Deloitte Touche version 
of what SaskPower’s auditors were saying clear back to 1994, 
that Channel Lake was a problem. It’s off the rails. We’ve got 
their version of what the auditor said. We do not have the 
auditor’s report and letter to management. 
 
The Deputy Premier says we can deal with second-hand 
documents. I say we need primary information. Will the Deputy 
Premier say we can get at the primary information or do we just 
need second-hand information to deal with it? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — I say to the member opposite that 
your request at the surface sounds reasonable. My point here is, 
let’s get the committee up and running on March 31 and every 
one of those issues will be dealt with in an expedient manner. I 
say to the members opposite, especially the Conservatives, I say 
again, why do you refer to your committee as a kangaroo court? 
What are you planning to do if in fact you do get it going? 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is the first time in my 20 years in the 
Assembly that I have ever seen the Chair of the Public 
Accounts Committee and their caucus afraid to come to the 
committee. What’s up? What are you doing? What are you 
afraid of? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Information on SaskPower Commercial 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Every action and 
every calculating word the government uses proves that the 
Public Accounts Committee process can’t work because you 
won’t give us the information that we require. And here’s one 
other example. 
 
We recently sent a freedom of information request to 
SaskPower Commercial about Guyana and this is the response 
we got back: 
 

SaskPower Commercial is not a government institution as 
prescribed by the freedom of information regulations and is 
therefore not subject to freedom of information Act. 
 

And guess who signed it? Larry Kram. 
 



March 24, 1998 Saskatchewan Hansard 255 

Mr. Minister, SaskPower Commercial is spending millions of 
dollars all over the world — taxpayers’ dollars, not your 
dollars. You’re saying that this is not a government . . . that 
you’re not a government institution and you don’t have to 
answer freedom of information requests. That’s NDP 
accountability. 
 
Mr. Minister, will you lift the gag order on SaskPower 
Commercial by immediately putting it under the freedom of 
information Act? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I want to be very 
careful in answering this question because it’s a hugely 
important question. 
 
The member opposite, who chairs the Public Accounts 
Committee, says here in the Assembly that the committee 
doesn’t work and it’s a kangaroo court. What does she say 
about the workings of the legislature and its committees? What 
is she saying about the working of a democratic process here in 
the Assembly? 
 
I say to the member opposite, the reason the committee isn’t 
working is because you refuse to call the committee to do its 
work. Mr. Portigal has written to you saying he wants to come 
and give answers, to give evidence. Jack Messer . . . no, Jack 
Messer has said here on Thursday that he . . . “I am willing to 
be there.” The witnesses want to come. The witnesses want to 
come. 
 
Why do you want to hide from the working of a committee that 
you chair. This is an amazing process when you’re talking 
about being open and forthcoming, that you sit in the Assembly 
ringing the bells and hide from the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Draude: — SaskPower Commercial isn’t the only Crown 
that’s exempt from freedom of information. So is SaskTel 
International. 
 
Mr. Minister, this is taxpayers’ money you are playing with. 
And all we see is how the NDP captains of industry handle the 
sale of Channel Lake and others. You lost $5 million because 
someone forgot to read a contract. 
 
But you don’t have to give the taxpayers even one bit of 
information about how SaskPower Commercial or SaskTel 
International is spending our money in a foreign country. Mr. 
Minister, it’s disgusting. And so much for an open and 
accountable government. 
 
Will you immediately put SaskPower Commercial and SaskTel 
International under freedom of information? 
 
Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, I say to the members 
opposite, if they want to change the date of the committee to 
today or tomorrow to speed the process up, if you’re saying you 
want the answers today we will make very special arrangements 
to make it happen tonight, tomorrow morning, the next 
morning. 

But at latest, at latest we’re going to get to the bottom of the 
issue on March 31 and start the process of a public inquiry here 
in the Assembly. You’ll be able to stall until then. But on 
March 31 we’re going to be allowing Mr. Messer and Mr. 
Portigal to come and ask and answer questions. 
 
What I want to ask is why are you hiding from the committee, 
and why were you hiding the letter from Mr. Portigal? Why is 
that? Answer that question. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. I’ll ask all hon. members to 
come to order. Order. I’ll ask the members of the government 
and the official opposition caucus to come to order.
