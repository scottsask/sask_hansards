again, I appreciate them for coming today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 
Elphinstone-Centre. 
 

Regina Rescue Mission Fundraiser 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last night I had the 
privilege of attending Regina Rescue Mission’s First Annual 
“Love Your Neighbour” fund raising banquet. 
 
The event was a huge success with over 400 people in 
attendance to help raise funds in support of the programs and 
services offered by the Regina Rescue Mission. 
 
The Regina Rescue Mission was founded in 1999 by Rev. Ken 
and Michelle Porter. Since then they have provided healing and 
hope to the addicted, the homeless, and others in need, both at 
the Scarth Street shelter and now at their new LifeChange 
centre on 8th Avenue — both of which are located in Regina 
Elphinstone-Centre. 
 
The mission has helped thousands with food, shelter, clothing, 
personal counselling, and addictions recovery. Keynote 
speakers for the banquet were Danny and Alison Barrett. Their 
words were powerful and their generous commitment to free 
speech was admirable. 
 
A definite highlight of last night’s proceedings was the 
graduation of five men from the Mission’s LifeChange recovery 
program. As its name implies, Mr. Speaker, the program helps 
individuals make fundamental changes in their lives, guiding 
them on to a path of spiritual growth and providing them with 
practical life and job skills. I congratulate the five graduates 
from the LifeChange recovery program for their perseverance, 
bravery, hard work, and achievement. 
 
(14:15) 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the sponsors of last night’s event 
and everyone who attended for their support of the worthy and 
important work carried on by the Regina Rescue Mission. And I 
particularly want to commend the staff and volunteers of the 
Regina Rescue Mission, particularly Ken and Michelle Porter, 
for the way that they live up to the challenge of Luke 10:27 of 
loving thy neighbour as thyself. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Estevan. 
 

Efforts of SaskPower Employees During Snowstorm 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s no 
secret that we’ve been praying for moisture down in the 
southern part of the province, but the weather over the past 
couple of days had more than a few people looking up at the 
heavens and wondering what was happening. It certainly wasn’t 
what we were expecting, Mr. Speaker, and it did seem a little 
bit late in the year. But this being Saskatchewan, and given that 
the last few years have been extremely dry, we’ll take moisture 
in any form we can get it. 
 
Now while some members of the House can honestly say that 
they haven’t seen one drop of moisture in their constituencies 
over the past couple of days, I’d like to inform all members that 
the Estevan area got more than its fair share. The storm, a 
Colorado low as Environment Canada called it, dumped nearly 



1090 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 2004 

30 centimetres of precipitation in the area, most of it in the form 
of snow, sleet, and freezing rain. 
 
Now when you factor in all this moisture, and add in a fairly 
strong wind, Mr. Speaker, it’s no surprise that some power lines 
went down in our community starting early Tuesday morning 
and continuing throughout the day. But thanks to the tireless 
efforts of dedicated SaskPower crews, most of the lines were 
back up and operating as soon as possible — with the last 
reconnect being done this morning — restoring power for 
residential customers in the southern part of the province. 
 
On behalf of my constituents in and around the Estevan area, 
I’d like to send a big and heartfelt thanks to all SaskPower men 
and women who worked so hard over the past couple days and 
nights to see power re-established in the area with a minimal 
amount of disruption and inconvenience. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Fairview. 
 

Meewasin-Saskatoon Credit Union Clean-Up Campaign 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity 
to congratulate and thank residents of Saskatoon and their 
community partners for participating in the annual 
Meewasin-Saskatoon Credit Union Clean-Up Campaign. 
 
For the last 22 years, thousands of community-minded residents 
have joined together to show their pride in keeping our city 
beautiful by cleaning away winter debris along the river valley, 
in neighbourhood parks, schoolyards, and along our city streets 
and boulevards. Last year more than 17,000 people registered 
for this valuable community initiative. 
 
This year the campaign was officially kicked off at St. John’s 
Elementary School. It began on Earth Day, April 22, and will 
run to May 31. 
 
As part of the campaign, volunteers from the Saskatoon running 
community, including Saskatoon Road Runners and the 
Brainsport Running Club, wearing their signature blue jackets, 
recently joined in and cleared away litter along the east side of 
Meewasin Valley Trail, between the Victoria bridge and 
University bridge. 
 
These athletes, who could be seen running alone along the trail 
or in groups, especially on Wednesdays, Wednesday nights for 
the Brainsport group run, indicated that as regular users of the 
Meewasin Trail they felt a responsibility to help clean it up. 
 
I congratulate the Meewasin Valley Authority, the Saskatoon 
Credit Union, students and staff from St. John’s Elementary 
School, and all community volunteers for participating in 
Saskatoon’s annual Clean-Up Campaign. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

Jada Walchuk, a grade 10 student at Vanier Collegiate in Moose 
Jaw, competed in and won the Optimist International Oratorical 
Competition held in Sheridan, Wyoming. She competed against 
others from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, and Wyoming. 
 
Jada was sponsored by the Optimist Club of Moose Jaw, and 
she’s the first and only winner from Moose Jaw ever since the 
beginning of this contest some 50 years ago. 
 
This year’s topic was: Thinking, Working, and Expecting the 
Best. Along with this accomplishment, Jada received a $1,500 
scholarship in US (United States) funds to further her 
education. Jada first won the regional competition which was 
held in Regina before going on to Sheridan to win the district. 
 
Jada was diagnosed at the age of eight months with cerebral 
palsy and much of her speech was centred around her struggles 
with that terrible disease. Jada’s topic, Thinking, Working, and 
Expecting the Best, truly reflects her attitude toward life. 
 
I hope that Jada will complete her education in Saskatchewan 
and find a way to stay and contribute to this great province 
under a new government that encourages thinking and working, 
and allows young people to expect the best right here at home. 
 
Congratulations to Jada. And thanks to the Moose Jaw Optimist 
Club for sending Jada and her parents, Rob and Cheryl, to 
Sheridan, Wyoming to take advantage of this great opportunity.

Women Entrepreneurs Week 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this is 
Women Entrepreneurs Week in Saskatchewan. This week has 
been set aside to recognize the significant contribution made by 
women to the provincial economy. 
 
Women are a force in business. In 2003 over 33 per cent of all 
Saskatchewan businesses were owned and operated by women. 
Women entrepreneurs are one of the reasons that our provincial 
economy is experiencing some of the strongest growth in the 
nation. 
 
Saskatchewan women are quickly becoming success stories in 
the business world. Women like Shannon Stewart of Curves in 
Regina, Joyce Liebrich of the Dollar Store with More in Prince 
Albert, and Rhoda O’Malley of Step Ahead Shoes Inc. in 
Saskatoon. 
 
The non-profit organization Women Entrepreneurs of 
Saskatchewan plays an important role in nurturing women who 
are considering or currently operating a business in 
Saskatchewan. I urge everybody to take a look at the Women 
Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan’s Web site for a list of more 
award-winning businesses owned and operated by women. 



May 13, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1091 

To date, Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan has provided 
about $8 million in loans to Saskatchewan businesswomen. 
These loans have helped create or maintain over 500 full-time 
jobs in the province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in celebrating the 
entrepreneurial spirit of Saskatchewan’s women. Thank you.

Youth Business Excellence Awards 
 
Mr. Weekes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. On Saturday, May 1, 
I had the pleasure to attend the Youth Business Excellence 
Awards held at the Perdue complex. 
 
The program spearheaded by Mid Sask CFDC/REDA 
encourages young entrepreneurs to develop business and 
marketing plans for business. Entries ranging from 
hand-painted fishing hooks, to doughnut franchises, to hunting 
lodges were impressive, as was the number, quality, hard work, 
and foresight put into each of the projects. 
 
Although entries from business proposals were developed by 
students from a number of schools, I have not the time to 
mention all the entries. However I would like to mention those 
from Perdue that took part and did an excellent job on their 
respective projects: Justine Hunter, Jaselyn Boucher, Justine 
Cleghorn, Halie Anderson, Tessa Bell, Riley Saretzky, Mark 
Coben, Ryan Panamaroff, Connor Hoffman, Katlyn Anderson, 
Charity Lewis, Kyle Reinelf, Michael Seltzer, Rachel Fyson, 
Jolene Lammers, Drew Magensen, Jenel Anderson, Terrilyn 
Burwell, Claire Weir, Keegan Urick, Courtny Fenrich, Paul 
Herrem, Allison Jalbert, and Clayton Robertson. 
 
I would like to congratulate these and the other students that 
entered their business proposals. It is encouraging to see these 
very bright minds looking to meet the challenges of the 
business world.

Laureus World Sports Award Recipient 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, the Laureus World Sports 
Awards are considered the premier honours in the international 
sporting scene, and are unique in that they recognize the 
world’s best athletes for their achievements across all sports and 
all countries. 
 
A Saskatchewan sprinter was recently named Sportsperson of 
the Year in the disabled athletes category at the annual Laureus 
World Sports ceremony in Portugal. These awards are selected 
by 400 sports journalists from 70 countries. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Saskatchewan native Earle Connor is a leg 
amputee sprinter who won over fellow athletes from Nigeria, 
South Africa, Sweden, Germany, and Britain to take home this 

prestigious title. 
 
Last year Mr. Connor had a stunning summer on the track, 
setting world records in four events. He broke the 100-metre, 
the 200-metre, and the 400-metre world records all on the same 
day in Germany. And just six days later in Milan he lowered his 
own 200-metre record to 26.4 seconds. 
 
Winning this award ranks Mr. Connor with Formula 1 driver 
Michael Schumacher and professional golfer Annika Sorenstam 
who were also honoured with this award. All three are the best 
in the world at their sport. 
 
I am sure my colleagues will join me in acknowledging Mr. 
Connor’s hard work, commitment and dedication. And in 
congratulating him, his mom, Diane Connor of Lafleche, 
Saskatchewan and his grandma, Doreen McDonald of Watson, 
on his outstanding accomplishments.

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Property Tax Relief 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Premier. The Premier campaigned last fall on 
a platform of phoney promises — promises that included 
property tax relief immediately. The Premier then went this 
spring to SARM (Saskatchewan Association of Rural 
Municipalities) convention and said the status quo is not on. 
 
Today Saskatchewan families and property owners all over the 
province have learnt one more thing. They cannot trust this 
Premier’s word. Mr. Speaker, the Premier has no intention of 
dealing with property tax relief this year, next year, or possibly 
the year after. 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. I would ask the member to 
phrase his question in a way that it doesn’t question the motives 
or the integrity of any other member in the legislature. 
 
I recognize — order, order, order please — the member for 
Indian Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, that’s pretty tough to do, but 
the Premier had no intention of . . . 
 
The Speaker: — I would remind the member that Speaker’s 
rulings are not to be commented upon. Once again, I recognize 
the member for Indian Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, in the announcement today we 
saw absolutely no commitment to reducing property tax burden 
on Saskatchewan landowners any time in the near future. Why 
would the Premier campaign on one thing, promising property 
tax relief, and now in the announcement today do something 
totally different? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 



1092 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 2004 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, we went to the people of 
Saskatchewan in November with a campaign that we would 
make Saskatchewan ready for its next generation. Mr. Speaker, 
today — this day — the Minister of Learning and our 
government have taken a bold step forward for change, Mr. 
Speaker, a bold step forward to ensure quality education, K to 
12 (kindergarten to grade 12), for the future generations of 
Saskatchewan children. That’s what we’re doing today, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
And I find it interesting; it’s about 60 years ago that the 
government of that time took a similar bold step to form the 
larger school divisions in Saskatchewan to ensure quality 
education for this past century. Mr. Speaker, we’re taking that 
kind of bold step forward today. We are making this province 
ready for its next century. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, there’s one huge difference 
between 60 years ago and today. Tommy Douglas kept his 
promise. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, the NDP (New Democratic 
Party) promised . . . the NDP’s announcement today talks about 
school boards’ forced amalgamation, and that may not be 
complete until the year 2007. The minister also talked about 
property tax relief, and that would be dependent on the federal 
equalization formula. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why is the Premier using forced amalgamation 
and the equalization formula to try and gloss over promises that 
he made, that he knows he made, in the last provincial election? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, another change — in 1944 
there was a credible opposition in Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we are taking this bold step forward, this bold 
initiative of change to bring about a circumstance of fairness 
and equity for the people of Saskatchewan wherever they live. 
To put in place — under this bold initiative — to put in place 
the platform on which we can invest new provincial resources 
to begin that important shift off of the property tax base, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
I have made it very clear in the public, at SARM, in this 
legislature, that this problem that we’re addressing didn’t get 
here overnight, and it won’t be solved overnight. It will be 
solved by careful planning, by careful work with our partners, 
and it will be solved on the principle that our goal is build 
quality education for Saskatchewan young people, our goal — 
to make this province ready for the next century. 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it’s 
interesting to hear the Premier talk about the opposition when 
he clings to power by his very fingertips, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, but should I remind the Premier what he had to 
say last fall. Mr. Speaker, the Premier said last October in a 
campaign stop in Yorkton, he said the NDP platform, and I 
quote: 
 

. . . provides . . . room to receive the recommendations of 
the Boughen Commission on funding of education. 

 
(14:30) 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, today we hear the minister of Education 
talking nothing about the Boughen Commission, nothing about 
the funding of education and the burden that has placed on 
property tax owners all over this province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, property tax reform needs to be addressed and 
needs to be addressed today — not two years down the road, 
not three years down the road, not even four years down the 
road, Mr. Speaker, and not when the federal government gets 
around to dealing with the equalization formula. Property tax 
needs to be addressed today. Will you stand up and address 
your promises during the last election? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting 
opposition that we have in this legislature because on a daily 
basis they walk into this House and say we should spend more 
money on virtually every subject. 
 
Now it’s an interesting opposition who would lobby this 
government hard, lobby this government hard on a daily basis 
not to put the provincial sales tax on restaurant meals. They 
lobbied us hard every day of the session until the budget. Now 
they want us to do just that, apparently. They want us to do just 
that — to take that recommendation from the Boughen report, 
put the tax on the restaurant meals and apply it to education. 
 
Meanwhile they also say we need to put significant more 
resources into health care, significant more resources into the 
university, significant more resources into the highways, and 
they say we should lower the taxes and balance the budget. Mr. 
Speaker, it is not a credible opposition. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, the Premier promised 
immediate property tax relief last fall during the election. He 
also told SARM that the status quo was not on. Well today, Mr. 



May 13, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1093 

Speaker, we found out the status quo is on. 
 
Last May they struck the commission, the Boughen 
Commission, to deal with education funding. Since that point, 
and specially through the announcement today, the minister 
stands and points his fingers at school boards saying, they’ve 
got to amalgamate and stands and points his finger at Ottawa 
and say, they’ve got to come through with money. 
 
The one person he isn’t pointing his finger at is himself. He’s 
the one that made the promises for property tax relief. He’s the 
one that’s broke the promises for property tax relief. When will 
he stand in his position and live up to the promises he made last 
September? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Learning is 
part of a government that in this budget put 18 million new 
dollars into K to 12 education . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — And 10 million new dollars into revenue 
sharing. That’s a government that’s doing something about 
property tax in this province, and we’re seeing municipalities 
across the province being able to hold property tax increases 
this year. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the members of this House 
precisely what it is that I said to the delegates of SARM in 
2003. I’m going to quote directly from that, from that speech. 
Quote: 
 

(Therefore) Our priority in tax reform for government over 
the next several years must be the matter of the funding of 
education. 
 
While it is not easy, and while the solutions will not be 
simple, and let no one suggest the solutions are simple, I 
say to you this morning that the status quo is not on. 
 

Well, Mr. Speaker, the status quo is not on. This government 
today is taking a bold step forward for the reform of education 
to bring fairness and equity into the system, and to build that 
platform on which we may invest in K to 12 education and lift 
some of that burden off the property tax base. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 

Future of Kerrobert Hospital 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, the west central 
health group out of the Kerrobert area are here today to let the 
Minister of Health know they do not want the Kerrobert 
Hospital to be the target of the NDP’s upcoming round of health 
care reforms. This group — which has the backing of two 
towns, nine villages, and eight RMs — believes a decision to 
downsize the Kerrobert Hospital and reduce services would be 

an extremely short-sighted one and one with long-term 
ramifications for the community. 
 
The west central health group believes any such decision would 
weaken the hospital to such a point that it would be forced to 
close down, leaving a massive void for health care services 
between Kindersley and Unity. 
 
Can the minister guarantee his government will not downsize or 
decrease the services currently available at the Kerrobert 
Hospital? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, as I’ve said in this House 
and in other places in the province in the last six weeks, we put 
160 million new dollars into health care. Much of that money 
went to the regional health authorities. We’re working with 
them as they develop their budgets. 
 
We’ve asked everybody within the health care system to take a 
very hard look at all the things that they’re doing because we 
don’t have sufficient resources to do things as we’ve been doing 
them before. I’m not apologizing at all for the fact that we’re 
looking very diligently at all of the expenses that we have. 
 
We will continue to work with communities and understand that 
there are many very good services that are being provided in 
facilities right across the province. That’s the concern that we 
have, and we’ll be working with every community, including 
the community that the member raises. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The west central 
health group is made up of volunteers from a number of 
communities who are taking a proactive approach to preserving 
health care services in their community. 
 
About a year ago this group began work on a plan to enhance 
health care facilities and services in the area. When the budget 
came down with a vague, yet ominous statement that there will 
be facility closures or conversions, the group sped up the 
planning process, hired an outside consultant with their own 
money, and put together a comprehensive proposal that would 
ensure the Kerrobert Hospital continues to provide services at 
current levels. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the delegation here today would like to take 20 
minutes with the minister to go through their proposal. After all, 
once the decisions are made, it’s even harder to change 
someone’s mind. Mr. Speaker, the minister just said that he’s 
asked groups at the health board level to look hard at solutions. 
So I would ask the minister if he’ll take the time today to look 
hard at the proposals put forth by this proactive group. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the minister: will he commit today to 
considering the proposal which I ask now to be tabled? 
 



1094 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 2004 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I will clearly commit to 
considering the proposal. The appropriate process, which I 
assume that the committee has done, is to work with the 
regional health authority who makes the plans for the things 
that happen in their particular area. And so if that has not 
happened, then I encourage them to have the discussion. But 
I’m fairly certain that they have had very extensive discussion 
with the Heartland Regional Health Authority. 
 
Mr. Speaker, what we try to do across the province is to make 
sure that we end up with a provincial perspective on what we’re 
going to provide for health care, but also a local perspective. 
And I know that many, many communities have provided very 
good advice on what’s appropriate in their community, and I 
look forward to seeing what this particular community has 
presented. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Kindersley. 
 
Mr. Dearborn: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would remind the 
minister that the decisions are in his hand. The delegation today 
is very aware of where the Heartland Health Board is situated. 
They came to Regina today to hear answers from the minister. 
 
I’ve been trying to get a meeting for the west central health 
group with the Minister of Health for a few weeks now. A 
number of dates and times were provided to the minister’s 
office for when the group could meet with the minister. I have 
called the minister’s office myself four times, and my assistant 
has been in regular contact with the minister’s office to get a 
time and date. And yet the minister has no time to meet with 
this delegation. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this delegation has driven five hours to come here 
today to get some answers. Will the minister commit to meeting 
with them this afternoon for . . . if only for if 20 minutes? And 
if not, will he commit to travelling to Kerrobert himself to meet 
with the community to discuss their proposal on the future of 
their hospital? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I think everybody in this 
Assembly knows that I’m a very reasonable man and a person 
who meets with people right across the province. And I will 
meet with this particular community, and it’s . . . I’m not sure if 
we have time now today, given all of the other things that we’re 
doing in this particular Assembly, but I will meet with them. 
But I think that the nature of the member opposite’s questions 
also reflect one of the challenges that that particular area has in 
their representation. And I encourage all members who have 
come here to this legislature to observe very carefully how and 
what has been done. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 

Future of Gull Lake Health Centre 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, last 
night in Gull Lake there was a public meeting to discuss the 
future of the Gull Lake Health Centre. And this meeting was 
put together in about 24 hours, and over 800 people showed up. 
Mr. Speaker, that’s 800 people coming to a public meeting with 
24 hours notice. I think that shows a level of very serious 
concern about the NDP plan to close health centres throughout 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, today the mayor of Gull Lake, the reeves, and 
some of the councillors of the surrounding RMs, as well as the 
town physician, have come to Regina to get an answer from this 
government. Will the Premier make a firm commitment today 
that the Gull Lake Health Centre will not be closed? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, it’s my understanding that at 
the meeting the CEO (chief executive officer) from the Cypress 
Regional Health Authority was present and was able to answer 
many questions and provide information. That’s entirely 
appropriate, and I encourage communities to be involved. It’s 
unfortunate that the members opposite have raised the . . . sort 
of the level of concern that they have around a number of these 
communities because we are working very diligently with many 
capable people across the province to make the appropriate 
decisions. And I encourage all people to be patient and allow us 
to do the work that needs to be done. 
 
This is an extremely complex area, and we don’t want to 
damage communities. We don’t want to put patients in danger. 
We want to make sure that we provide good health care, but we 
have to do it with the resources that we have. I encourage that 
member especially, the other member who’s asked the 
questions, to stand up and vote for this budget — show their 
constituents that are here that they support dollars for health 
care. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, it’s true the CEO of the Cypress 
Health Region was in attendance at the meeting last night. And 
though he answered many questions, there was one question he 
would not or could not answer. And that was about the future 
opening and the maintenance of the existing health centre in the 
community of Gull Lake. He could not or would not answer it, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
So the Gull Lake Health Centre has 33 long-term care beds 
operating today. They’re all full. It has three multi-purpose 
beds. And because the health centre is there, Gull Lake has a 
doctor who serves thousands of patients in the southwest part of 
the province. Dr. Kozroski would not be able to stay in Gull 
Lake if the health centre closed. Where would her patients go, 
Mr. Speaker? Where would the seniors and the long-term care 
beds go? 
 



May 13, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1095 

Mr. Speaker, the people of Gull Lake and area deserve answers. 
Will the Premier make a commitment today that the Gull Lake 
Health Centre will not be closed? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, we are working with $160 
million in new money in health care. We’re trying to make that 
money go across many, many demands that are there. We have 
heard in this Chamber many requests from the opposition to 
increase spending in all kinds of areas and especially, as we 
heard earlier, as it relates to the education tax that’s on property. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have to try to make some choices on this side 
of the House to get an appropriate balance. We’re continuing to 
work very hard to make sure we get a choice that balances those 
people and that community’s concerns around property tax, 
with their concerns around what kind of health care facilities 
they have in their communities. And we’re listening very 
carefully, and we’re not going to do this in a hurry. We’re not 
going to make decisions without having a lot of discussion. And 
that’s what we’re doing right now, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cypress Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health has said 
that he will meet with communities before any decisions about 
closures are made. Now the mayor of Gull Lake, the reeves of 
surrounding RMs, some of their councillors, and Gull Lake’s 
only physician have come to Regina today to meet with the 
minister to discuss their very serious concerns. 
 
Will the minister undertake to meet with this delegation as well 
as the one from Kerrobert this afternoon? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, given the length that this 
session has taken today due to some unknown reason to me, we 
are really cramped on a lot of meetings that I’ve had scheduled 
already. But I would be willing to meet with those people after 
the Volunteer Medal ceremony when the tea is on. And so if the 
member opposite wants to do it at that point, that’s fine with 
me. But I then do have many challenges. I have a very, very full 
schedule today involving extremely important issues for our 
health care system. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Government’s Commitments for Health Care 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, at last night’s meeting in Gull Lake, 
a number of municipalities announced that if their health centre 
is shut down by the NDP, they will withhold their share of 
funding — their commitment — their share of funding for the 
new Swift Current Regional Hospital. They said they’ll have no 
choice but to send that message. We know that Foam Lake has 

taken similar action with respect to a project in Yorkton and, 
Mr. Speaker, that is what the NDP are doing with this. They pit 
community against community. Mr. Speaker, you don’t build 
up one part of Saskatchewan by tearing the other part down. 
 
(14:45) 
 
Mr. Speaker, just a few years ago this Premier promised not to 
close beds. He said it wasn’t the answer. This whole matter can 
be resolved with one simple step — the Premier to stand in the 
legislature today and say that he will keep his promise, that they 
can count on his word. Will he do that, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, if the new Leader of the 
Opposition hasn’t already done so, I would invite him to read 
carefully the action plan for health that we have provided to the 
people of Saskatchewan, when we talked very specifically 
about health care facilities across this province and where we 
made very careful observation that no government can ever 
freeze-frame the existing circumstance forever. We have said 
very carefully that where issues confront communities in the 
provision of medical staff or in the provision of nursing staff, in 
the situation of a change in demographics, we were very 
specific about this, Mr. Speaker. And most citizens of 
Saskatchewan, except these members of the Saskatchewan 
Party opposition, have read this and would understand it. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, we are going to make the best decisions 
available to us with new resources — perhaps not sufficient to 
all the demands, but new resources — decisions that will 
benefit the people of Saskatchewan in every one of our 
communities. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, maybe the 
Premier should review his words. From December 5, 2001, this 
is what the Premier of the province said with respect to health 
facility closures. He said, and I quote: “The answer to financial 
sustainability is not to be found in the conversion or closure of 
small hospitals.” Mr. Speaker, that’s what the Premier of this 
province said. 
 
The question is simple. The question is simple. Will he keep his 
promise? Will he give the people of Kerrobert, the people of 
Gull Lake, the people of Herbert, people across this province, 
will he give them a reason to trust his word, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, as with each and every 
budget year, we are working with our health regions to 
determine those decisions. In a matter of days or weeks the 
Minister of Health, in concert with the health regions, will 
announce precisely this year’s budget activities and the 



1096 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 2004 

outcome thereof. 
 
What we have already announced are new CT (computerized 
tomography) scanners, a new MRI (magnetic resonance 
imaging), a new hospital and new facilities in the member’s 
hometown. 
 
But I’ll tell you what this government won’t do. I’ll tell you 
what we won’t do, and I would have no part of, Mr. Speaker, 
what that Leader of the Opposition and that party are doing. 
They are going into communities today across the province, 
fearmongering, raising concerns, causing unnecessary concern 
among the people of Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. I’d have no 
part of that, and I thought this leader promised us a new, more 
credible opposition. I’ve not seen it yet, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely incredible. It is 
absolutely incredible that the Premier would make the statement 
he just . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Once again, I recognize the 
Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely incredible that the 
Premier would make the mistake he made. He wonders why 
communities in this province are concerned about this 
government and whether or not facilities will be closed. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, maybe it’s because it was referenced in his 
own budget, Mr. Speaker. Maybe it’s because at this 
government . . . he as associate minister of Health closed 52 
hospitals in the province of Saskatchewan already. Maybe it’s 
because they have watched him break his word on every 
promise he made in the provincial campaign, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And that is the question today. He has a chance to stand up and 
answer the question to the people of Kerrobert and Gull Lake 
and Herbert, who require these facilities, these facilities that are 
busy. Will he keep his promise? Will he keep his word, Mr. 
Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Calvert: — Mr. Speaker, first of all the Leader of the 
Opposition wants to review history. He wants to review some of 
his own history, when he worked for the operation that sat on 
this side of the House, on this side of the House and put this 
province to the verge of bankruptcy. Maybe we want to review 
that . . . 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I tell you this. We made a commitment to 
the people of Saskatchewan, and the people of Saskatchewan 
know where the New Democratic Party is on health. I’ll tell you 
that. We made a commitment to the people of Saskatchewan 
that we would provide, with the resources available to us, the 
best possible public health care that we can provide. And we’ve 
made a commitment to the people of Saskatchewan that we 

would do that based on the fundamental principles of medicare 
— the fundamental principles that were established in this 
province by this party and have been fought by that party in 
whatever machination we’ve seen in this legislature. 
 
Now, Mr. Speaker, it’s time. It’s time. Let’s get to some 
fundamentals. Let’s get to some fundamentals. Let’s hear from 
this Leader of the Opposition. What are his fundamental 
principles when it comes to the delivery of health care in the 
province? Is he a supporter of publicly funded and administered 
medicare or not, or is he with his friend, Steven Harper, and the 
Conservative Party? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Learning. 
 

Reform of Education System 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
I’m very pleased today to have an opportunity to stand in this 
House and to make a statement in reference to the restructuring 
of our school system. 
 
This morning I had the pleasure to be in Balgonie at the 
Balgonie Elementary School to announce a significant change 
to our education system. Balgonie Elementary School, members 
in this Assembly may know, is part of the Qu’Appelle Valley 
School Division that was recently amalgamated from Buffalo 
Plains, Cupar, and Indian Head school divisions. 
 
I did this announcement at Balgonie for two reasons. One, 
because it was a school in a newly . . . recently amalgamated 
district, and also because I think it served to remind all of us as 
to what the reason is for our education system, which is to make 
sure we have the highest quality services possible for the 
children of this province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Today I am pleased to have announced 
the government’s response to the Boughen Commission on 
financing our K to 12 system. That response is in keeping with 
the comments that I made on January 8, where I indicated that 
the issues presented by the commission were complex and did 
deserve close attention; that the commission did in fact provide 
valuable service to the province in identifying a number of 
issues. But that there were also concerns about some of the 
most high profile recommendations and a lack of consensus in 
the province on the way to move forward, not the least of 
which, not the least of which of course was the recommendation 
to increase the provincial sales tax and to expand that sales tax 
on to restaurant meals. 
 
Certainly, as members in this House know, that had we 
expanded the sales tax on to restaurant meals that would have 
made an additional $56 million available for property tax 
reform. Members are aware of that and I certainly understand 
that they were . . . where they were on that issue as they 
presented petition after petition in this House, arguing why we 
should not undertake that position. Undoubtedly they too 



May 13, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1097 

understood the trade-off that that would result in. 
 
And as a result today we have decided instead to move forward 
with a number of other initiatives that were contained in the 
Boughen report, and other initiatives that I believe will help 
advance our school system as we move forward in the coming 
decade. 
 
Mr. Speaker, our school system is changing. Today there are 
about 175,000 students in the province in just over . . . just 
under 800 schools. It is interesting to note, Mr. Speaker, that as 
a result of demographic changes, as a result of families deciding 
to delay having children or having smaller families, that in fact 
what we are seeing is about 3,000 fewer students entering 
kindergarten than are graduating out of grade 12, on an annual 
basis. 
 
The result, Mr. Speaker, for the system is that we see a growing 
cost of education and the infrastructure around it. We see 
pressure for offering new educational resources and 
technologies where class numbers are shrinking; we see 
pressure for expanded school capital in communities in the 
North and urban areas where school populations are expanding; 
and we see pressure for fairer funding in larger communities 
where class sizes are growing due to the natural urbanization of 
the population. 
 
As a result, we need to change the way that we structure our 
school system to ensure a maximum amount of money is 
available for education and can be dedicated to student services 
and instruction. At the same time we need to help mitigate the 
upward cost pressures of sustaining an infrastructure designed 
for a much larger student population. 
 
That is why today I have announced the first part of a 
three-phase program to renew our school system. These three 
phases will focus on renewing and restructuring school 
divisions, developing a fairer system of funding from the 
provincial treasury, and committing to a long-term solution to 
lowering property taxes in Saskatchewan. 
 
As a first step in this process, I am pleased to announce that a 
three-member education equity task force will be appointed to 
develop a new school division boundary map for the province. 
The task force will be chaired by Fred Herron, who members of 
this Assembly know is an esteemed former head of the 
Teachers’ Federation and has an outstanding and intricate 
knowledge of the school system. 
 
In the coming weeks, I intend to appoint two additional public 
representatives with experience at the school division level to 
assist Mr. Herron in this task. 
 
The task force will consult with school divisions and education 
stakeholder organizations on the new boundaries to be 
established and will use the following criteria. The current 82 
school divisions will be restructured to result in no more than 
40 new divisions, including public, separate, and francophone 
divisions. 
 
Each school division will have a minimum of 5,000 students. 
This recognizes a need for us to move from a system today 
where we have many school divisions with fewer than 50 

students in them; some school divisions who have no schools in 
them. In fact, Mr. Speaker, this will recognize the need for us to 
modernize our system. 
 
Each school division will have a base assessment per student 
that would allow it to qualify for provincial funding under 
existing programs, thereby eliminating the phenomena of the 
zero grant boards or boards that receive no provincial funds. 
 
Except in special circumstances, existing divisions should be 
amalgamated in their entirety to provide for greater ease of 
consolidating the local contracts and the setting of uniform mill 
rates within the regional divisions. These conditions clearly do 
not apply to the North and the border community of 
Lloydminster given their unique circumstances. 
 
And finally, while dealing with amalgamations, we will 
maintain respect for minority faith provisions of the 
Constitution. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there have been successful voluntary 
amalgamations. We have seen the benefit of these through the 
amalgamations at Sask Rivers, Qu’Appelle Valley School 
Division, Saskatchewan Valley, all of which have shown that 
amalgamation can lead to enhanced programs for students. And 
again I remind all members of this Assembly that the school 
system is there to serve the students of this province. 
 
Certainly declining enrolments and inequities in the assessment 
pool are just two reasons we need to move forward with 
sustainable change, change that’ll improve student access to 
education and improve equity for ratepayers no matter where 
they live. 
 
Mr. Speaker, when we talk about changes, we understand that 
as we move to larger districts that we need to be mindful of how 
to protect individual local community control and input. As 
such, I have directed that the Department of Learning will 
develop a new system for local involvement within the larger 
divisions, building on the strength of the SchoolPLUS model. 
 
I have directed the department to develop a new accountability 
mechanism at a local level that incorporates a new role for 
teachers, parents, ratepayers, and community agencies in 
schools at the community level to maintain and enhance local 
accountability, and that this model will be in place before the 
new, larger board elections are held. 
 
I have asked that the education task force consult with divisions 
and stakeholders, and that they provide us with a new map no 
later than November 15 of this year. Along with that, I have 
asked that the new divisions will include new subdivision 
boundaries for local elections of trustees, and that elections will 
be held no later than October 2006. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to tell members that we have pulled 
together a restructuring coordinating committee to involve the 
stakeholders in this sector, including the School Boards 
Association, SASBO, LEADS, the STF (Saskatchewan 
Teachers’ Federation), and other entities. 
 
In order to make sure that local interests are protected during 
this time of transition, I have announced this morning that there 



1098 Saskatchewan Hansard May 13, 2004 

will be a moratorium on school closures effective September 1, 
’04, and it will remain in place until December 31, 2006. 
 
I have also directed the Department of Learning to develop a 
new process for provincial funding of the school system, a new 
way to calculate the foundation operating grant that will take 
into account the renewed fiscal capacity of new divisions and 
put a focus on equity, simplicity, and transparency of 
government funding. In doing so, it will seek to reduce the 
number of factors we take into account from the current 17 
different criteria, while emphasizing the basic strength of the 
per pupil grants. 
 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to comment on the issue of 
education property tax. Our government recognizes that 
property owners, in particular agricultural property owners, are 
concerned about the level of education property tax. Today our 
government has committed that as new money becomes 
available through our efforts to deal with Ottawa and deal with 
its flawed equalization program, that we will dedicate 30 per 
cent of those new funds directly to property tax relief. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the change in the school district restructuring, the 
change in the foundation operating grants, and our commitment 
on property taxes clearly demonstrates that the status quo is not 
on. 
 
In closing, let me say that this new seven-point plan will serve 
as the basis for the most substantial education reform in 
Saskatchewan during the last 60 years. It will serve as a basis to 
restore fairness and equity to our education system. And it will 
ensure that Saskatchewan students will continue to have access 
to the high-quality services and schools that they deserve. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that is the commitment of our government and I 
am pleased to announce it today. Thank you very much. 
 
(15:00) 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Well thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to say it’s a privilege to respond to the ministerial 
statement made by the Minister of Learning. I would also thank 
him for sending over his remarks prior to his statement and I 
had a chance to review them. I also had a chance to listen to 
them earlier today in Balgonie, as I was at the press conference 
the minister hosted regarding their response to the Boughen 
Commission. 
 
I have been in a lot of schools, Mr. Speaker, not only going to 
school but also after my school life when I taught in the school 
system for 10 years. And I’ve stood outside the doors and 
watched kids come out of the school, and never in my life have 
I seen so many people walk out of a school today with such 
glum, sad faces as the people from SARM, SUMA 
(Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association), and the 
School Boards Association, Mr. Speaker. 
 
There wasn’t a group that listened to the minister’s conference 

today that didn’t come out with a sad and glum look on their 
face. And, Mr. Speaker, it’s a shame because this government 
had an opportunity — they had an opportunity after 
commissioning Mr. Ray Boughen to look at the finances of 
education and to do the right thing and address property tax in 
this province. And they’ve missed and they’ve missed sorely, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about 
restructuring our school system to ensure that the maximum 
amount of money available for education can be directed at 
student services and instruction. And I would agree with that 
totally. 
 
It was interesting that they used that setting to make their 
announcement, the setting in Balgonie school, because Balgonie 
was formerly part of the Buffalo Plains School Division which 
then amalgamated with the Indian Head School Division and 
the Cupar School Division, making a large school division of 
well over 5,000 students. 
 
There wasn’t one time when the government came out there and 
held a gun to their head like they’re doing after this 
announcement — that this is exactly how you have to form it 
and this is the way it will be drawn up. And that’s what the 
minister announced after today. 
 
He’s going to strike a commission that’s going to look at . . . or 
another commission that’s going to look at restructuring. And 
as he’s mentioned a couple of times — not only today but in the 
past — that they’re going to come with a map. Now you tell me 
what input school boards will have in their destiny when his 
commission comes back with a map and saying this is how the 
landscape of school boards are going to look in this province 
after his commission. 
 
It has no input from school boards. And school boards have 
worked hard; they’ve worked diligently over the last three or 
four years and prior to that — over the last 10 years — to 
follow along with the minister and what the directions were 
from the Department of Education. 
 
The Department of Education said a number of years ago, we 
want to see 25 per cent less school divisions in this province. 
And the school divisions, school boards at this point are within 
a couple per cent of 25 per cent less — doing exactly what the 
minister had asked them to do. 
 
It’s like the minister drew a line in the sand and when the 
school boards got to that line, he erased that line and said, that’s 
not good enough; let’s draw the line down here. And quite 
frankly, we don’t think that you can get to that line so we’ll do 
it for you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we have absolutely no 
question and no problem with amalgamation. Amalgamation is 
the direction that we need to go. But there’s a difference 
between boards choosing their dance partner and the 
government dictating to school boards who their dance partner 
will be. 
 



May 13, 2004 Saskatchewan Hansard 1099 

It was interesting to listen to the minister talk about setting the 
frame or the reference for this new task force regarding school 
division amalgamation, and it’s got a number of points here in 
his speaking notes. It says one point here, there will be no more 
than 40 new divisions, including public, separate, and 
francophone divisions. No more than 40. So the government 
right there is dictating. 
 
Now that may be the proper number and I’m not saying it isn’t 
the proper number. But perhaps school boards should have a 
say in what the proper number should be, Mr. Speaker. 
 
It says each school division will have a minimum of 5,000 
students. Well it’s quite interesting. I don’t know how the 
minister is with math and how he did in math when he was in 
school, but if you have 40 divisions at 5,000 students per 
division, that would mean we’d have well over 200,000 
students in our school system right now. We have 40 divisions 
at over 5,000 people per division, we should have over 200,000 
people in our school system right now, and he’s wrong. We’ve 
got about 170,000 students in our school division, which is 
dropping by at least 3,000 students a year, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I’m not saying that a 5,000-student school division is not the 
way to go. But take a look at the reality of rural Saskatchewan 
right now, Mr. Speaker. You would be looking at school 
divisions in the Southwest that the borders would probably run 
from Moose Jaw to the American border, and Moose Jaw west 
to the Alberta border — a school division of that size to get to 
the minimum of 5,000 people, 5,000 students per division, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, I’m not saying that . . . Maybe 5,000 students 
per division is the route to go, but to dictate that they have to be 
no less than 5,000 students or the minister will not accept it is 
unreasonable and unrealistic. It doesn’t match with rural 
Saskatchewan today. 
 
Now that’s not surprising because I’m not sure the last time he 
has been out to rural Saskatchewan. I guess today I could say he 
was to Balgonie, but has he been out to a rural school division 
and seen the geographical constraints that are put on divisions 
and amalgamation of divisions in that area? 
 
Mr. Speaker, it was interesting the minister . . . his opening 
paragraph says the Minister of Learning held his news 
conference today to announce the response to the Boughen 
Commission on Financing K to 12 Education. And I think in the 
minister’s own words when he was pushed by the media — 
because the Boughen Commission was structured to deal with 
the financial situation of education, how to properly finance 
education, and that was what the Boughen Commission was 
struck for — and in the minister’s own words, he said, well 
maybe it isn’t really a response to Boughen, frankly, because it 
doesn’t deal with what Boughen was asked to deal with. 
 
The announcement today was simply his idea and the 
Department of Learning’s idea of the direction of education, 
notwithstanding anything that Ray Boughen and the Boughen 
Commission had to say, Mr. Speaker, because the key point that 
the Boughen Commission talked about was reducing the 
property tax burden — not only in rural Saskatchewan but in 
urban Saskatchewan too. 

Because I don’t think there would be a member on that side of 
the House that went door knocking from door to door that 
didn’t get . . . Whether it was in Moose Jaw or whether it was in 
Saskatoon or whether it was in Maple Creek, one of the major 
issues that every one of us found on the doorstep was the major 
burden of property tax, and not just property tax — not just 
property tax, but specifically the education portion of property 
taxes is onerous to growth in this province. Something needed 
to be done and the government knew that. 
 
The government struck the Boughen Commission for the very 
purpose that every one of us that were elected heard on the 
doorstep the problem with education funding in this province. 
We have to take it off of property tax and we have to put it 
more in the government’s hands. The government has to 
actually put more money into education so that there is less 
reliance on property tax. And unfortunately after the Boughen 
Commission, the government missed it completely. 
 
So, Mr. Speaker, this is not a response to the Boughen 
Commission. This is a response to how he and the department 
of Education want to see with the direction of education. 
 
And we can debate whether amalgamation and directed 
amalgamation or forced amalgamation is part of it, but as Ray 
Boughen said, you can’t cherry-pick the report. The report was 
designated, the report was designated for property tax, the 
report was directed for property tax relief, and that is the one 
area that this provincial government completely lost. 
 
The provincial government and the minister said, well if we get 
more transfer from the federal government, perhaps we’ll move 
that over and then address property tax. He’s missed the total 
point of the Boughen Commission. 
 
Next time this government spends $500,000 on a commission, I 
wish it would read it and follow the recommendations. Thank 
you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the minister on her feet? 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — To adjourn the House, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Would the minister . . . I’d like to go through 
a couple of more items here.
