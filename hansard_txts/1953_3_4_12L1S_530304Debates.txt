LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

First Session — Twelfth Legislature 

15th Day 

 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

The House met at three o‘clock p.m. 

 

Before the Orders of the Day: 

 

EUROPEAN FLOOD RELIEF 

 

Hon. T.C. Douglas (Premier):  Mr. Speaker, I wish to report on the progress which is being made 

with reference to the European Flood Relief Campaign. As all hon. members know, His Excellency the 

Governor-General accepted the chairmanship of a Canadian national European Flood Relief Committee 

and broadcast an appeal to Canadians everywhere to respond to this very worthy cause. The Prime 

Minister asked the Chief Justice and myself to act on that National Committee. Because of the House 

being in session I was not able to go, but a representative from the Government was at the committee 

meeting held in Government House. A committee was very hastily formed here; letters were sent out to 

all mayors and reeves asking for their support and co-operation and also to all organizations in the 

province. 

 

I would just like to say a word or two about the magnificent response which has been coming in. Those 

members who were at the dinner given to the ex-service members of the Legislature will remember it 

was announced then that the Ladies auxiliary of the Canadian Legion had already subscribed $1,500. I 

believe they have since subscribed another $1,000. The Saskatchewan Command of the Canadian 

Legion also subscribed $1,000. 

 

Yesterday, in my capacity as Minister for the Co-operatives, the Federated Co-operatives sent me a 

cheque for $1,000 to be turned over, and I have the very heartening word, this morning, that the 

Kinsmen Clubs in Saskatoon and North Battleford have put on a drive; they hadn‘t quite finished 

counting the money when they called me long distance, early this morning, but from Saskatoon they had 

raised $11,784, and North Battleford had already passed the $1,500 mark, and they were still counting 

more money coming in. When you realize that the city of Saskatoon just recently contributed some 

$12,000 to the ‗March of Dines‘ in addition in this over $11,000 which was subscribed yesterday, I think 

you can see how generous that city has been. 

 

I have no time to mention now the towns of Estevan, Yorkton and a number of other places which have 

also contributed and are in the process of collecting more money. I would like to take this opportunity to 

express the thanks of all the members of this House, of the Provincial Committee and, I am sure, of the 

National Committee to all those who have assisted in raising this money for European Flood Relief.

The House met at three o‘clock p.m. 

 

BUDGET ADDRESS 

 

Hon. C.M. Fines (Provincial Treasurer):  I rise at this time to move that Your Honour do now leave 

the chair, and that this Assembly resolve itself into Committee of Supply for the consideration of sums 

to be granted to Her Majesty. 

 

In drawing attention once again to the wording of the Motion, Mr. Speaker, I am mindful of two things: 

first, that this is the first session of a new Legislature, which welcomes to its ranks and its 

responsibilities thirteen new members; and second, that this is to be the coronation year of Elizabeth, 

Queen of Canada. It is a matter of history that by the time of the first Elizabeth, the basic idea of 

parliamentary consent to taxation had long been a familiar principle, although it was still far from being 

an inviolate rule. The Queen, though well known for her strong imperious will, was shrewd enough to 

recognize the temper of the people and took pains to seek from Parliament its consent to the grant of 

funds. In our legislative library, for instance, there is a yellowing, musty 150-year-old book which 

recounts the speech of Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer, asking the Commons to agree 

to a ―grant of a Subsidy to Her Majesty‖, in the year 1575, some 17 years after Elizabeth first ascended 

the throne. The essential art of persuasion was much the same then, as now, as these words from the 

Chancellor so readily suggest: (I quote) 

 

―…And that you may be the better judge of that which I shall propound, it is requisite that I put you in 

remembrance, 1st, how the queen found the realm; next how she hath restored and conserved it; and 

3rdly, how we stand now. Touching the first, no man can be ignorant how that our most gracious 

queen, at her entering, found this noble realm, by reason of the evil government preceding, miserably 

over-whelmed with depression, dangerously afflicted with war, and grievously loaded with Debts; the 

burthen of which three cannot be remembered without grief…‖

The old book records, moreover, that thanks to the success of the queen in ―restoring and conserving her 

realm‖, and in part to the eloquence of her Chancellor, the Commons was readily persuaded after some 

debate to grant her the subsidy required. 

 

As honourable members well know the rule of Parliamentary control over the purse strings is a very 

basic principle in the democratic system of government. The debate upon the motion just placed before 

you, Mr. Speaker, stems from a similarly old and related slogan of the House of Commons: ―Grievances 

before Supply‖. It affords every member of a parliamentary assembly, and particularly those of Her 

Majesty‘s Loyal Opposition, the most convenient opportunity for bringing general criticism and 

suggestions upon the financial administration and policy of the government. So, too, in the less formal 

and less procedure-bound atmosphere of the Committee of Supply. Here members must discharge their 

prime responsibility to examine the government‘s programs with care and diligence, and particularly the 

revenues and expenditures through which these programs are put into operation. 

 

THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 

 

In turning first today to a review of economic conditions in the province, let me refer briefly to some 

highlights from the reports laid before Parliament just two weeks ago. In 1952 strong consumer demand, 

record capital investment, a full-flowing export trade, and heavy defence outlays, all sparked the 

Canadian economy to new highs. For the country as a whole it was another year of record production, 

income, employment and trade. The grow national product – which measures the market value of all the 

goods produced and the services performed in the country – reached close to $23 billion. This was an 

increase of more than 7 per cent over 1951, and was reflected in a corresponding advance in personal 

income, to the level of over $17 billion. Here a considerable decline in the net income of all the nation‘s 

farmers was more than offset by substantial gains in the earnings of labour and other sectors. The strong 

demand in foreign markets for certain basic commodities boosted total exports to a record high. And 

expenditure by all governments in Canada rose by over $1 billion, the increase going chiefly for defence 

purposes. 

 

It is noteworthy that the upward thrust of prices was largely brought to a long-awaited halt in 1952. 

Consequently a good part of the increase in G.N.P. represented a real advance in the physical volume of 

output. Rising industrial activity in many parts of the country, particularly where related to resource 

development and the defence program, was a major factor in this growth. But as this Assembly well 

knows, by far the most striking increase came from the grain fields of Western Canada – and particularly 

from the Province of Saskatchewan. 

 

The year just ended, Mr. Speaker, has emphasized again the key role played by prairie agriculture in the 

working of the national economy. The record wheat crop alone contributed better than $1 billion to 

national output. During the year exports of wheat soared to over $620 million, to recapture first place 

from newsprint as Canada‘s most important single export commodity. Wheat, wheat flour and coarse 

grains moving to foreign markets added up to almost $1 billion – close to one quarter of total exports 

from the country. Our farm industry produces

these and other basic commodities for export trade and national consumption. It provides a prime 

support for those services of trade, finance and transport, essential for national unity. And not least of all 

it supplies the sheltered market for domestic manufacturing industry. We need, then, make no apology 

whatever – especially in this House – for continuing vigorously to urge upon Ottawa a full and proper 

recognition of the economic rights and social needs of prairie agriculture. 

 

THE BOUNTY OF THE FIELDS 

 

There will be little need for me to dwell at length upon the amazing bounty reaped from the grain fields 

of the province last year. Under ideal spring weather conditions our farmers worked day and night, first 

to rescue over 140 million bushels of the 1951 crop left in the fields, and then without pause to seed 

some 23½ million acres for the 1952 season. Subsequently, with an abundance of moisture in the soil, 

the favourable spring and summer rains, and the long, dry fall, a total of almost 700 million bushels of 

grain was harvested. The wheat crop alone is estimated at 435 million bushels, surpassing by far the 

previous record attained in 1951 and easily equivalent to a good year‘s production for the whole of 

Canada. 

 

I few days ago, Mr. Speaker, you will recall that the honourable member for Nipawin, upon his maiden 

speech to this Assembly, drew our attention to an interesting fragment of Saskatchewan history. It was 

his father, the Hon. Thomas MacNutt, then representing the constituency of Saltcoats, who presided as 

Speaker over the first session of the First Legislature of the province. With this reference in mind, I 

looked into the initial Journals of this Assembly, reporting upon those early sessions. Anyone interested 

in the history of our province will find that record a most human and revealing document. I should like 

to quote just one paragraph delivered by the Lieutenant Governor, the Hon. A.E. Forget, on March 29, 

1906, in Saskatchewan‘s first Throne Speech. (I quote) 

 

―You will be pleased to learn that the inaugural year of this Province has proved to be the most 

auspicious in so far as the reward given to the labours of our agriculturalists is concerned. The results 

of the first harvest gathered after the establishment of the Province…indicate that an era of general 

prosperity has been entered upon, the limits of which can hardly be estimated. Within the boundaries 

of this Province, 26 million bushels of wheat have actually passed through the threshing machine 

during the past season. What this means may perhaps be partially gathered from consideration of the 

fact that, over the area now comprising the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, in the season of 

1904-05 only 16 million bushels of wheat were threshed.‖

CONTINUING FARM PROBLEMS 

 

This first Throne Speech goes on, Mr. Speaker, to refer to some difficulties in the ―dairy industry in the 

West‖ and to express regret over the withdrawal of assistance by the ―Dominion Government‖. Needless 

to say, such regrets seem as timely today as they were 47 years ago. For the chief difficulties in our 

economy in 1952 were those experienced in the dairy and livestock industries. While the value of grain 

production increased by 30 per cent in 1952, the value of livestock marketings showed a sharp fall of 27 

per cent. As honourable members will recall, just one year ago a desperate campaign against foot-and-

mouth disease was being waged in this province. Partly because of the disease, cattle marketings 

decreased by 14 per cent. Prices to the farmer fell from an average of $30.13 per hundredweight in 1951 

to $19.50 in 1952. While the marketing of hogs gained substantially in numbers, here again average 

prices per hundredweight fell by one third. Furthermore, declines of a moderate level were experienced 

in dairying, in poultry and egg production, and the output of honey and wool. 

 

These disappointing results reflect one of the most serious problems in our provincial economy. 

Shrinking export markets for a wide range of our farm products, other than wheat and grain, combined 

with the complete lack of an effective federal price support program, pose great obstacles against 

provincial efforts to build a more balanced, diversified agriculture in Saskatchewan. The lack of action 

by the Federal Government on the South Saskatchewan irrigation project is no less damaging a blow to 

such efforts. 

 

A second problem which must always be watched is the relationship between prices for farm products 

and the costs of farm operation. The overall price-cost ratio took a further turn for the worse in 1952. 

The index of prices as of August, 1952, showed a decline of 11 per cent from the previous year, with 

both indexes based on initial prices for grain. On the other hand, over the same period, the cost of 

commodities and services used by farmers in their operations rose by three per cent. The increase in 

grain production and resulting higher gross returns has partly softened the effects of the price-cost 

squeeze upon the net income position of the farmers. But it continues to be a matter deserving of real 

concern. 

 

Now thirdly, huge crops produce their own problems, — the threat of surpluses and lower prices. 1952 

marked the final year of the International Wheat Agreement, and negotiations for its renewal are still 

proceeding. The Agreement, together with the Wheat Board system of marketing, has exerted a strong 

stabilizing influence on prices and markets. And it is to be hoped that a new treaty can be negotiated to 

insure future stability upon the best possible terms for our farmers. With buoyant domestic consumption 

and record export demand continuing, the immediate outlook for markets is highly encouraging. 

Nevertheless, the carry-over is building up to substantial levels, and we must continue to give the 

marketing picture the closest attention.

STRONG POSITION OF AGRICULTURE 

 

Despite these danger points, and the setbacks I have mentioned, it still remains true that 1952 has been 

the most prosperous farm year in our history. The gross value of agricultural production is estimated at 

well over $1 billion, an all-time high by a wide margin. Actual cash income received during the year 

rose to $700 million. And while net farm income for the country as a whole fell by 12 per cent from the 

1951 record, this province registered a gain of better than 10 per cent. 

 

The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that the past several years have witnessed a notable strengthening and 

consolidation in our agricultural industry. In the ten years, 1941 to 1951, capital investment in our farms 

rose from $897 million to $1,970 million. As against this high valuation, mortgage indebtedness has 

continued to fall, and amounts owing to the major loan companies in 1951 amounted to only $16 

million, a 14 per cent reduction from the previous year, and less than 1/6 of the comparable debt load 

carried in 1937. Although land, buildings, livestock and equipment have all shared in the flow of 

investment, the increase in farm machinery has been especially marked. Thus over the same ten-year 

period the number of grain combines in use increased four-fold, the number of farm trucks increased 

150 per cent, and the number of tractors doubled. At the same time the average size of farm, as reported 

by the census, has expanded from 470 acres in 1941 to 550 acres in 1951. New land has been brought 

under cultivation. Better land use and cultural practices promise greatly increased stability. And 

improved organization and management – both on the individual farm and in the industry generally – 

have brought our agriculture to a new high level of efficiency and productivity. 

 

THE MINERAL BOOK 

 

In any ordinary year the agricultural record I have just cited would have completely overshadowed gains 

in other sectors of the economy. But these records have been matched by the equally spectacular events 

taking place in the mineral field – especially in oil, gas and uranium development. 

 

The actual value of mineral output fell slightly from the 1951 peak of $51 million, chiefly because of a 

decline in the base metals sector of the Pre-Cambrian minerals. More important, however, exploration 

and development of the hard-rock minerals reached an entirely new peak in 1952. Activity in the 

uranium areas took on the aspects of the old-fashioned gold rush. Over 4,000 claims, double the 

previous year‘s record, were staked and recorded. Some sixty companies have acquired properties for 

further work. Total expenditures during the year are estimated at close to $16 million. 

 

As honourable members well know, Mr. Speaker, the focus of activity has been the uranium 

development of the Beaverlodge area. The Federal crown company‘s new concentrating mill will go into 

production this spring at a rate of 500 tons of ore per day. It will double that capacity as other private 

mines swing into production. The search for uranium and other minerals is also going ahead in several 

other areas of the north, and late last year Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting announced plans to go 

underground at a new base metals prospect just west of Flin Flon.

OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT 

 

Nearer home to most of us, the newspapers have kept us well informed on the progress of gas and oil 

development. Producing fields in the province boosted output from 1,250,000 barrels to more than 

1,600,000 barrels. Current productive ability exceeds 8,000 barrels daily and is being added to rapidly. 

Exploration activity and rate of discovery reached new highs in 1952. Last year‘s investment totalled 

$31,000,000 – and commitments for 1953 are estimated at $45,000,000. Among the most promising 

finds located during the past year were the light oil strikes in the southeastern part of the province – at 

Wapella and Forget. Together with the Ratcliffe discovery in 1951, they fully confirm the potential 

productiveness of the Williston oil basin extending into this province. In the southwest, the Eastend-

Swift current region added developed fields and widely scattered new strikes of gas and medium gravity 

oil. This production will move eventually to markets in Moose Jaw and Regina by pipeline, plans for 

which have already been announced. In the west-central part of the province the Lloydminster-Lone 

Rock heavy oil fields have been steadily extended and continue to contribute the bulk of the province‘s 

crude output. But several important new discoveries in that general region were also added to the picture 

during 1952. Rapid development of the Coleville field has also been underway, and the completion of a 

large stripping plant will provide the marketing facilities necessary for further commercial development. 

 

Closely associated with the oil program has been the widening extent of natural gas discoveries. 

―Wildcat strikes were made at several locations in the south-east and south-west, and development wells 

at Coleville proved up reserves variously estimated up to 500 billion cubic feet. The Brock field was 

tapped last year to serve the towns of Brock and Kindersley. This year it will begin to serve the major 

market in the City of Saskatoon, as well as several smaller towns along the 140-mile route. This project, 

Mr. Speaker, is only the first step in an aggressive plan to take gas to all the major centres of 

Saskatchewan. This assurance of the early development of markets will do much to spur an even more 

intensive exploration and drilling program elsewhere in the province. 

 

It is tempting to speculate upon how far this developing picture may lead us in the near future. But that 

is probably better left for now to the imagination of members themselves. All I wish to do at this point is 

to emphasize the very considerable and encouraging progress achieved in the past few years. The well-

known publication, ―Oil in Canada‖, stressed this point in its editorial columns only last week when it 

declared: (and I quote) 

 

―When it is realized that direct expenditures on exploration, drilling and production reached a record 

figure of $50 million in Saskatchewan – almost one-fifth of the expenditure in Alberta last year – it 

must be recognized that the wheat province has come into its own as a hot oil province. This 

conclusion is intensified by the unofficial but quite understandable forecasts of Saskatchewan oil

men that at least 1,000 wells and possibly 1,200 will be drilled in that province in 1953. When this 

figure is placed alongside the same number of wells drilled in Alberta as recently as 1951, the progress 

of Saskatchewan can be appreciated.‖ 

 

OTHER RESOURCES AND INDUSTRIES 

 

In other mineral fields, Mr. Speaker, the level of output continued to advance, or at least was well 

maintained in 1952. Coal production and salt cake declined somewhat, but common salt, clay products, 

raw clay and sand and gravel were all up in value of sales. The exploration and testing of our vast potash 

reserves pushed ahead, and prospects in this area are bright. 

 

So, too with the forest potential of the province. The saw timber cut was maintained at the higher level 

established in 1951, limited only by the policy of sustained yield. New and expanded plants are helping 

to assure full utilization while steady work on the inventory is proving up the adequacy of the pulpwood 

resources to support a large scale pulp industry in perpetuity. Outstanding forest engineers, in 

commenting favourably upon the management policies now in effect, place Saskatchewan‘s forests 

second only to certain favourable locations in British Columbia as ripe for pulp mill development. 

 

Output totals for the value of manufacturing production in 1952 are not yet available. But further capital 

investment in plant and equipment forecast at $15 million last year, together with the 6 point gain in the 

index of employment in larger manufacturing firms, suggest a continued gain over the 1951 level. A 

serious setback was experienced in the meatpacking industry, but this was offset by substantial gains in 

oil refining, metal fabrication, food processing and wood-using industries. 

 

Suggestive, too, is the continued rising demand for electric power. Exclusive of the hydro installations in 

the north, kilowatt hours generated at central electric stations exceeded the 530 million mark and 

registered an increase of 16 per cent over the previous year. Other service industries also worked at full 

capacity. Revenue freight loadings were up by 20 per cent; and with the continuing high levels of capital 

investment, the construction trades worked to full capacity. Trade and finance pushed up to new high 

levels. For the second successive year Saskatchewan led all provinces in percentage gain in retail trade. 

Total sales during the year reached some $723 million, and increase of 15 per cent over 1951. 

Correspondingly the turnover of cheques at bank clearing centres in the province soared well over $3 

billion. 

 

POPULATION AND INCOME 
 

In summary, Mr. Speaker, let me draw attention to some significant overall indicators. It appears certain 

that capital investment in the province in 1952, forecast at the new high of $382 million early in the 

year, more than reached this mark. As a result, for the five-year period, 1948-1952, federal government 

surveys record a total 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

 

8 

of $1.650 billion in private and public investment flowing into the development of this province. At June 

1st last the Dominion Bureau of Statistics estimated that, after allowing for inter-provincial migration, 

the population of Saskatchewan rose by some 11,000 persons over the 1951 census count. It thus 

reverses the downward trend underway since 1936. It strengthens our resolve to push ahead with the 

kind of program that will insure a growing population for the province. Finally, the data on personal 

income provide the key to the story of Saskatchewan‘s expanding economy. As I noted before, the 

estimate just published at Ottawa places personal income for Canada as a whole in 1952 at $17.146 

billion. This is $1,188 per capita. A preliminary estimate for Saskatchewan is $1.210 billion. This is 

$1,425 per capita – 70 per cent higher than the previous ten-year average, and one-fifth better than the 

national average. 

 

It is always difficult to look into the future. It is particularly hazardous to try to forecast economic 

conditions in this province. Rightly we cannot count on better than normal crops over the year ahead, the 

consequently some decline in agricultural production and income may be expected. On the other hand a 

large part of the income reported for this year consists of very substantial farm inventories which will 

move to market in 1953. Prospects for such marketings at favourable prices have already been bolstered 

by the recently announced increases in initial prices. Farm cash income will thus receive a substantial 

start from these factors. Added to this are the other elements of strength in provincial resource 

development by now familiar to us all. This generally good prospect is supported further by the 

expectations of continued prosperity at the national level. The federal forecast, as recently announced, 

looks forward to further gains in output, employment and income this year. In total the expectation is a 

gross national production for 1953 about 4 per cent above the 1952 record. If this is achieved we have 

good reason to be confident about the year ahead. 

 

With this background of record and prospects, Mr. Speaker, I should like to turn now to the financial 

accounts of the province. 

 

FISCAL YEAR 1951-52 

 

The Public Accounts for the fiscal year 1951-52 were tabled earlier in the session, disclosing a surplus 

of $118,675 on Revenue Account. Expenditures totalled $61,534,387, with revenues reaching a new 

high of $61,653,062. The social services and development programs that expenditures of this magnitude 

imply were, of course, the direct result of a strong and expanding economy. 

 

The size of the surplus is not significant in itself. What is significant is that it is the eleventh consecutive 

surplus of the province. What is even more significant is that of the more than $9,500,000 of Liquor 

Profits, not one cent was taken into Revenue Account to finance current programs. Instead, these 

revenues were reserved for retiring our bonded debt, for making payments into sinking funds to provide 

for future debt redemption, and for the financing of capital investment.

CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, 1952-53 

 

As all honourable members know, Mr. Speaker, the budget for 1952-53 provided for even greater 

services to the people of Saskatchewan. During the year government departments have been 

implementing their programs as nearly as possible according to budgetary plan. The major increases in 

expenditure for which supplementary estimates are being submitted to this Assembly are due to 

circumstances which could not easily have been foreseen. For example, much high expenditures than 

contemplated are being made on Child Health, due to the serious poliomyelitis epidemic of last summer. 

The cost of health services for our old age pensioners and social aid recipients has risen significantly 

through increased payments to medical practitioners. Capital funds are also required for housing projects 

made possible by the participation of municipalities and the federal government. The Hospital Services 

Plan will be receiving additional sums to meet the still-rising costs of hospitalization. However, the 

largest increase in 1952-53 is for highway construction. A prolonged dry fall and a mild winter 

permitted our construction crews to work long after the time when such work usually comes to a 

standstill. 

 

Fortunately the growth of revenues has made this extra effort possible. Although the full story will not 

be known until after March 31st, I can confidently predict that the Government will declare its twelfth 

successive surplus this year, notwithstanding the fact that expenditures on Revenue Account for the year 

will be approximately $67,500,000. 

 

REVENUE AND CAPITAL BUDGETS, 1953-54 
 

Mr. Speaker, the estimates for 1953-54 fiscal year were tabled earlier today. They provide for the 

following revenues and expenditures: 

 

On Revenue Account:  

Estimated Revenues $70,515,810 

Estimated Expenditures $70,425,920 

Estimated Surplus $       89,890 

  

On Capital Account:  

Estimated Expenditures $17,300,000 

 

In addition to these sums, the Government proposes to make advances totalling some $23,000,000 to the 

Power and Telephones Corporations. 

 

This is a budget for expansion, contemplating sizeable increases on both Revenue and Capital Accounts. 

And there may be some in this House – and elsewhere – Mr. Speaker, who will quaver at these figures. 

Yet as will readily be seen, the principal goal of the budget is to invest a proper share of current income 

in the expansion of the provincial economy, while at the same time improving the high level of social 

services fashioned since 1944. The ten-point ―program for progress‖, familiar to every honourable 

member, was developed after careful study of the needs of the province, and of the level of expenditure 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

 

10 

which our resources can support. It proposed, especially, very ambitious measures designed to 

safeguard, build and strengthen the provincial economy. The resounding endorsement given by the 

people of the province last June to that program reflects their faith in Saskatchewan. It is evidence of 

their readiness to pledge their wealth and energy – in the tradition of western Canadian people – to the 

building of a better future. 

 

At the same time, we are mindful of the caution that was born in the ‗thirties. It is not proposed that the 

program of capital expansion will be accomplished by piling up a huge load of provincial debt. The 

Government intends to finance a large part of the investment out of current revenues, particularly from 

liquor profits. Unless unforeseen circumstances arise, no liquor profits will be taken into Revenue 

Account for the provision of current programs. 

 

HEALTH, WELFARE AND EDUCATION 

 

Turning now, Mr. Speaker, to a review of the budgetary highlights, I should like first to refer to the 

increases in expenditure which are proposed for social services and education. The Legislature will be 

asked to vote over $10,000,000 for the Department of Public Health for 1953-54 exclusive of the grants 

to the Hospital Services Plan. This is an increase of over $850,000, necessary to continue and perfect the 

health services being provided. Provision is made for the further development of Health Regions, to 

bring to a larger number of our people a high level of essential public health services. The vote for Child 

Health includes a sum of $116,800 to finance a program of Physical Restoration, to ensure adequate 

treatment of those affected with polio in previous epidemics, and to meet any new outbreak of crippling 

diseases. The psychiatric services program will be further improved upon the completion of the new 

Moose Jaw Training School for mental defectives. This budget provides for its completion and initial 

operations. Finally, because of our desire to improve the quality of health care in the province, and 

because we will continue to press for a complete health insurance program, the budget proposes much 

larger sums for the training of nurses, laboratory, technicians, physiotherapists, physicians and other 

technical personnel. We also contemplate large expenditures on the University Hospital. The Medical 

College and this Hospital will combine as one of the finest institutions for the training of medical and 

nursing personnel on the continent. 

 

The decentralization of welfare services throughout the province, Mr. Speaker, will be continued in 

1953-54. Hand in hand with the consolidation of our main welfare programs will go a sizeable 

expenditure for the start of a new Nursing Home in Regina. In co-operation with private welfare 

organizations, the government is making a concerted effort to provide adequate care for the aged and 

chronically ill. Following on the completion of the Melfort Nursing Home next year, the beginning of 

the Regina Home will be a further milestone in this plan. It is also hoped that further progress can be 

achieved in the building of low-rental housing projects under municipal-provincial-federal auspices. A 

sum of $500,000 in capital account is proposed for this purpose.

The Department of Education budget provides for an increase in expenditure of $1,150,000. Honourable 

members will recall, Mr. Speaker, that last year we increased grants to schools by $1,600,000. I should 

like to point out that the Public Revenue Tax, which provided our source of revenue for this increase in 

grants, has now been turned over to the municipalities. In effect, therefore, the financial position of local 

government units has now been improved to the extent of $3,200,000 – half in the form of increased 

grants for education, the other half being available according to the wishes of the municipalities 

themselves. 

 

The major increases in next year‘s Education budget are: $63,000 for school text books and readers, 

$42,000 for the correspondence school, $360,000 for school grants, $233,000 for teachers‘ 

superannuation and $125,000 for the University of Saskatchewan. Honourable members will also be 

pleased to learn that there is provision in Capital Account for a start on the proposed Murray Memorial 

Library at the University. 

 

PUBLIC SAFETY 

 

One of the highlights of the budget, Mr. Speaker, is the increased attention given to the problem of 

public safety. The Government has had this subject under careful review and believes that more 

intensive measures should be introduced. The tempo of the electrification program, for instance, now 

requires more safety inspections of electrical installations by the Department of Labour. A special 

committee of this Legislature is to study the highway safety problem in the meantime the Government is 

proposing an increase in the budget for the Highway Traffic Board and is negotiating with the Royal 

Canadian Mounted Police for expanded highway patrols. The budget also provides for an increase of 

$289,000 in the cost of policing the Province. The R.C.M.P. have found it necessary, in our new contract 

with them, to double the charge for this excellent service. 

 

Other new items in the Revenue Account budget which might be pointed out, Mr. Speaker, are: 

$110,000 for the Royal Commission on Agriculture and Rural Life; $60,000 for the Golden Jubilee 

Committee; and $90,000 for the printing of the revised statutes in 1954. Of the most significant increase 

— $1,700,000 for sinking fund payments – I should like to speak later in my discussion of the public 

debt. 

 

AGRICULTURAL IMPROVEMENT 

 

Let me turn now to consideration of the varied maintenance and investment expenditures directly 

affecting the growth of the provincial economy. We shall ask the Legislature for authority to spend 

$3,825,000 on Agriculture in the forthcoming fiscal year, out of Revenue and Capital Accounts 

combined. No one needs to be reminded that agriculture is and will remain our basic industry. Any 

program for expansion, therefore, must place agriculture as a top priority. For 1953-54, over $1,500,000 

is being provided to carry on provincial programs in conservation and development – for drainage 

projects, irrigation work, land clearance and reclamation programs. This work is making available new 

land and generally increasing the productive resources of our agricultural economy. 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

 

12 

At the same time other programs will be stepped up. An accelerated forage crop program is anticipated 

by the Plan Industry Branch. A higher level of assistance to the agricultural industry is contemplated by 

the Animal Industry Branch. The Farm Implements Committee, which was referred to in the Speech 

from the Throne will begin operations in 1953-54. As suggested by last year‘s Legislative Committee, 

this body should be of great assistance to farmers in protecting them against inferior or inadequate farm 

machinery. 

 

NATURAL RESOURCES 

 

It was announced in the Throne Speech that, due to the unprecedented development of our natural 

resources, the Assembly would be asked to approve the division of resource administration into two 

departments. The first of these, the Department of Natural Resources will require $2,583,000 for 

continued expansion of programs relating to forestry, fisheries, game, northern roads, surveys and 

construction activities. The Construction Branch will make heavy expenditures for capital equipment, in 

order that the building of northern roads, forest access roads and airstrips might be continued. The forest 

inventory, which as honourable members know has been underway for some time, will be pressed 

toward completion next year. Valuable stocks of pulpwood, and poplar suitable for plywood, have been 

discovered by this survey, and for the first time, we will be in a position to present to forest product 

industries a full story on the resources available in Saskatchewan. To protect these valuable assets, an 

increase of 25 per cent is being proposed for the fire prevention activity. 

 

I have already mentioned the interest in uranium, base metals, industrial minerals, petroleum and natural 

gas. The administration of these potential provincial assets will be placed under the new Department of 

Mineral Resources with an estimated expenditure of $597,000. This is an increase of 53 per cent over 

the current year‘s expenditures and contemplates a substantial expansion of the development program. 

We shall need more geologists, more petroleum engineers, more technicians of all kinds to give the kind 

of service and the kind of impulse which our growing mineral economy warrants. It is proposed, too, to 

increase expenditures on geological mapping, summer geological parties, aeromagnetic surveys, and 

prospectors schools. These programs were initiated at a time when our resources were not attracting 

much attention. The results to date have already proven the value of our initial expenditure, and a higher 

level of investment at this time will bring still greater dividends for the future. 

 

NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRIC POWER 

 

Together with the search for oil and radioactive minerals, the progress in development of natural gas and 

electric power facilities has proved to be one of the most exciting phases of provincial expansion. The 

Minister of Public works will be dealing with these matters in careful detail before the House at a later 

date. I shall advise only that honourable members are being asked to provide us with authority to make 

greater capital advances to the Power corporation, to undertake the first major step in the overall plan for 

taking gas to the chief centres of the province. It is estimated that $7,000,000 will be required for the 

Saskatoon project – for the construction of the gathering facilities, the transmission line and pressure 

stations, and the 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

13 

 

distribution systems. If the job can be done on schedule, as we fully expect, it will be one of the fastest 

large-scale construction projects ever tackled in the province. 

 

Together with the new development in Government of Saskatchewan will go a steadily expanding 

program in electric power and rural electrification. In 1953-54 the Government proposes to advance to 

the Power Corporation some $10,000,000 to finance the biggest work schedule on record. This large 

sum will be needed for further extensions to generating capacity at key points, for additions to the high 

voltage transmission grid, for the rapidly accelerating mileage of new farm lines, and for a host of 

ancillary facilities and equipment. As the Premier has said, the benefits of electricity will be carried to 

our farms as close to cost as is possible. The modest surpluses accruing to the corporation each year are 

being ploughed back, with the new capital advances, into construction of a stronger and better power 

system. Our chief regret is that the long-awaited hope of building the benefits of the hydroelectric 

potential of the South Saskatchewan River into that system has once again been dashed to the ground by 

the delaying tactics of the Federal Government. 

 

TELEPHONES AND OTHER PUBLIC ENTERPRISES 

 

Major expansion, Mr. Speaker, is also contemplated for Saskatchewan Government Telephones. Final 

figures for 1952 have not yet been issued, but the system has already reported a net growth during the 

past year of 8,600 new connections and an increase of almost 12 per cent in the volume of long distance 

calls. To keep pace with the continued increase in demand for service, the largest program of plant 

expansion and modernization ever attempted in the 45-year history of the system, is being tackled this 

year. As only one phase of the overall target, it is hoped to add 10,000 new connections to system 

exchanges in 1953. Advances required amount to $6,000,000 while the re-investment of surplus will 

bring total capital expansion up to the $8,000,000 mark. 

 

Only a modest sum of $400,000 is provided in the capital budget for the Government Finance Office, 

covering advances to the other smaller crown corporations. As against that it will be noted that $600,000 

of surplus from this group of corporations is being taken into revenue for the public treasury. When the 

annual statements of all the corporations have been fully audited they will be submitted as usual to the 

House for careful scrutiny. It is clear from preliminary figures, however, that the public enterprises have 

enjoyed another highly successful year. Average employment rose from about 3,700 to over 4,400, 

while payrolls advanced to more than $10,000,000. Net book value of the revenue-producing assets 

owned by the people of the province in the corporations remained at about $75 million, but total 

turnover of business was up 14 per cent to $37,000,000. Total earnings before interest deductions 

amounted to almost $5,000,000 – an increase of almost $600,000 over the audited figures for the 

previous year. Corporations other than Power and Telephones provided a return of 10 per cent on 

Treasury advances outstanding at financial year ends, while a return of 7 per cent was earned by the two 

larger utilities. 

 

I should like to stress once again, Mr. Speaker, that these are the most obvious and direct returns from 

the public enterprises. There is no easy way to measure the wide range of indirect, social benefits 

accruing 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

 

14 

to the people of Saskatchewan. Yet it is clear that the corporations retain valuable purchasing power 

within the province. They are achieving substantial savings to consumers. They are providing greatly 

expanded service in such basic essentials as power, communication and transport. And they are assisting 

in the productive development and utilization of our natural resources. I think it can be said with all due 

conviction, Mr. Speaker, that public ownership has firmly established itself as an integral part of 

Saskatchewan‘s growing economy. 

 

INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT 

 

Hand in hand with the expansion of our own corporation, and with the mineral and natural resources 

development program, must go industrial growth generally. Our co-operative institutions have enjoyed 

another year of outstanding success, and the Department of Co-operation will continue to service and 

promote the growth of the co-operations movement in the province. At the same time it is proposed to 

expand our Industrial Development Office in 1953-54. As the existence of greater and greater resources 

is proven by surveys, inventories and exploration, we must make that information know to such 

industries as are interested in coming to the province. And as cheaper fuel such as natural gas becomes 

available, and basic resource industries are created, we will be working toward the attraction of other 

and related industries. Honourable members will be asked to vote some $80,900 for this activity for 

1953-54. 

 

HIGHWAY PROGRAM 

 

Perhaps no item in a provincial budget, Mr. Speaker, is of greater importance to honourable members 

than the highway program. Indeed, it is of vital interest to all citizens in all parts of the province. It has 

been our belief that a good highway system is most essential to an expanding economy and for that 

purpose we have been devoting a steadily increasing portion of the budget each year. The following 

table indicates the steady increase: 

 

1940-41 — $1,703,000 1947-48 — $8,840,000 

1941-42 —   1,845,000 1948-49 —   8,889,000 

1942-43 —   2,101,000 1949-50 —   8,767,000 

1943-44 —   2,852,000 1950-51 —   9,777,000 

1944-45 —   3,294,000 1951-52 —   11,918,000 

1945-46 —   3,908,000 1952-53 —   15,000,000(est.) 

1946-47 —   6,311,000 1953-54 —   16,100,000(est.) 

 

As the table indicates, we shall invest more money in our highway program during the next year than 

was provided in six years from 1940 to 1946. 

 

Prior to the abolition of the Public Revenue Tax we heard a great deal about the recommendations of the 

Committee on Provincial-Municipal Relations. In their report the Committee wrote a most interesting 

chapter on highways, which I would commend to all honourable members. They pointed out 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

15 

 

that we have a much greater mileage of roads than other provinces. They also pointed out that 

Saskatchewan has the second lowest rate of gasoline tax in Canada, and that our motor vehicle licences 

are also lower than in most other provinces. 

 

As honourable members well know, practically all of the Committee‘s recommendations for further aid 

to the municipalities have already been put into effect. Recommendation number 31 is ―That the 

gasoline tax be increased from 10 to 12 cents per gallon effective April 1, 1951, to assist in 

implementing the highway program.‖ Until we had carried out the recommendation to abolish the Public 

Revenue Tax we did not feel justified in increasing the Gasoline Tax. We now propose, however, to 

raise the Gasoline Tax by 1¢ per gallon, effective April 1, next. This will make our tax 11¢ a gallon 

slightly higher than in Manitoba, Alberta and B.C. It will be the same as in Ontario and compares with 

13¢ in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec, 14¢ in Newfoundland and 15¢ in Nova 

Scotia. 

 

The additional revenue to be derived from this extra cent per gallon, will be used for construction of 

highways, and will enable us to continue with Saskatchewan‘s greatest highway program. From time to 

time it is suggested that the Government collects from motorists more in gasoline tax and licence fees 

than is spent on highway construction and administration. While that may have been an accurate 

statement in the early ‗forties, it certainly is not true today, as can be readily seen from the following 

table taken from the estimates: 

 

REVENUE 

 

Gasoline Tax $12,000,000 

Licences and Fees     4,800,000 

 $16,800,000 

 

EXPENDITURES 

 

Highway Maintenance and Construction $16,100,000 

Interest and Sinking fund charges     1,413,750 

Administration of Vehicles and Gasoline  

Tax Acts        376,350 

Administration of the Highway Traffic Board        124,740 

 $18,014,840 

 

Thus it can be seen that even with the additional 1¢ levy, every cent raised from the gasoline tax and 

from licences and fees will be used for the highways, and in addition over $1 million will be provided 

from other sources. 

 

DEBT IMPROVEMENT 

 

I am very pleased to report continued improvement in the debt position of the province. Saskatchewan 

citizens have every right to be proud of their splendid record of unprecedented expansion with a 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

 

16 

steadily improving financial position. On April 30, 1944, Saskatchewan had the highest per capita net 

debt in the Dominion, but today, according to statistics published by the Investment Dealers‘ 

Association of Canada, we have the second lowest per capita net funded debt in Canada. A comparison 

of the debt as at April 30, 1944, and as at December 31, 1952, will be of interest: 

 

 

 April 30, 1944 December 31, 1952 

 

Gross Funded Debt $125,245,000 $139,579,000 

Treasury Bills     92,911,000     34,559,000 

Contingent Liabilities     20,016,000       1,799,000 

 $238,172,000 $175,937,000 

Less Sinking Funds     23,919,000     12,949,000 

 $214,253,000 $162,988,000 

Less Debt of Revenue   

Producing enterprises     36,930,000     65,209,000 

 $177,323,000 $  97,779,000 

 

From this, it can be seen that the net liability of our citizens has been reduced by a total of $79,544,000. 

But this does not tell the whole story. During this period of time, the province has acquired assets on 

capital account, other than revenue enterprises, valued at a total of $63,898,000. The reduction of our 

liabilities plus this growth of capital assets means that we have actually improved our financial position 

in the period under review by $143,442,000. 

 

NO NEW BORROWINGS 

 

There have been no new borrowings since April 1, 1952. During the fiscal year we have retired the 

following debt maturities, some of which, it is noticed, were not due until later dates: 

 

April 1, 1952 $     300,000 

September 1, 1952        150,000 

October 1, 1952        200,000 

October 1, 1952     4,500,000 

November 1, 1952        109,700 

January 3, 1953        180,000 

February 15, 1953     1,100,000 

March 31, 1953     4,983,000 

September 1, 1954        829,000 

Treasury Bills owing to Ottawa     1,915,000 

  

Total $14,266,700 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

17 

 

In addition, we have invested in capital projects to date during the fiscal year an amount of 

approximately $26,000,000. Thus, it can be seen that our total expenditures on capital account for the 

year will be over $40,000,000. This entire amount has been financed with our own funds together with 

the borrowing of $20,000,000 announced in my last budget address. Our capital position at present is 

quite satisfactory, and it is not our intention to borrow on the market until the next fiscal year. 

 

Interest rates have continued to rise throughout the year, will all provinces having to pay higher rates 

than for many years. It is not anticipated that there will be any noticeable improvement in the market for 

some months. Not only are interest rates higher, but there is a very limited amount of capital available 

for investment in Canada. This is, of course, due to the tremendous industrial expansion that is taking 

place in all parts of Canada, including Saskatchewan. It is for this reason that many provinces have 

found it more advantageous to borrow in the American market, where capital has been more available, 

and at more favourable interest rates. Much of this advantage has been lost in recent months because of 

the discount of the American dollar. There are signs, however, that the gap is closing, and that the value 

of the American dollar will rise again to parity with the Canadian dollar. 

 

LIQUOR PROFITS FOR CAPITAL ACCOUNT 

 

The entire amount of the liquor profits in the past two years has been available for debt retirement and 

for capital expenditures. This is one of the principal reasons we were able to undertake such a large 

capital program, without greatly increasing our debt. 

 

An examination of the estimates tabled today will show that it is not our intention to use liquor profits 

for current purposes in the next fiscal year. This will enable us to provide out of our own current revenue 

for a large part of our capital program and to meet our debt maturities as they fall due. 

 

I feel confident that this proposal will assist us greatly in expanding our economy without leaving a 

legacy of debt behind us. It will assist us also in our determination to eliminate the dead-weight debt, 

which has been such a burden in our financing in years gone by. 

 

Further steps toward this objective were taken during the twelve-month period ending December 31, 

1952, when the dead-weight debt of the province was reduced by $4,839,000. 

 

INCREASED SINKING FUND PAYMENTS 

 

In addition, Mr. Speaker, we are making provision in our current budget for a further significant move 

toward getting the province on a ―pay-as-we-go‖ basis. In 1944, the province had a total of 13 sinking 

funds to meet the 52 issues that were outstanding at that time. At present, there are still 52 issues 

outstanding, but there are 28 sinking funds. In other words, while the number of issues remains the 

same, the number of sinking funds has more than doubled. 



 

Wednesday, March 4, 1953 

 

 

18 

Something more important is the amount of the sinking funds. In 1944, the amount levied was either 1 

per cent or ½ of 1 per cent per annum. Clearly, this could pay off only a small part of the debt at 

maturity. The first step taken to improve the situation was in 1946, when we adopted the policy of 

providing a 2 per cent sinking fund on all new issues. This was continued until June of 1949, when for 

the first time, the province undertook to levy a 3 per cent sinking fund on all new issues, a policy which 

has continued ever since. This has resulted in 13 debenture issues involving $64,000,000 having sinking 

funds of 3 per cent annually. At present, we also have 7 issues amounting to $22,000,000 with sinking 

funds of 2 per cent, and 6 issues involving $14,000,000 with 1 per cent sinking fund provision. On the 

balance of our bonded indebtedness amounting to $40,000,000 we have had no sinking funds whatever. 

 

Commencing on April 1, 1953, we shall levy, for the first time, a full 3 per cent sinking fund on all the 

outstanding bonded debt of the province. This will provide an additional $1,700,000 annually for our 

sinking funds, and will eliminate any serious refunding problems in future years since the 3 per cent 

fund will provide for an amount of 75 to 80 per cent of the issue when invested for twenty years. 

Because of our improved financial position and because of these and other constructive steps taken to 

continue this improvement, Saskatchewan debentures today are highly regarded in financial circles. 

Evidence of this can be found in the daily bond quotations, and in the reluctance of investors to sell their 

Saskatchewan holdings. 

 

MILESTONES FOR SASKATCHEWAN 

 

I am sure that all honourable members, irrespective of party affiliation, were delighted to learn that 

Saskatchewan bonds, for the first time on record, have been given an ―A‖ rating in the investment 

markets. This higher credit rating ensures a much wider distribution and a better price for future issues. 

It is, thus, a significant milestone in the financial history of the province, and one that may rightly evoke 

some feeling of pride in us all. 

 

As one who has shared in the shaping of that history, perhaps I may be forgiven for looking back today 

over the past nine years. In introducing my first budget to the House, in 1945, I suggested that this 

government faced a two-fold task: first, to provide for the broad improvement of basic social services 

available to every citizen of the province; and second, to help direct the flow of all available investment 

resources and enterprise into the fullest possible development of the provincial economy. 

 

These have been the constant goals of successive budgets. I think it can be said we have moved steadily 

toward them. Yet in such measure of success as has been achieved, I recognize to the full and with all 

due humility, how greatly we have been blessed both by the staunch effort and support of the people of 

the province and by the full-flowing bounty of Providence. I look with confidence to these same 

blessings in the budget placed before you today. It represents the most ambitious step ever attempted in 

our overall program for consolidating the gains already achieved, and for building securely upon them 

the still greater Saskatchewan of the future. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move that you do now leave the chair.
