Walsh Acres. 
 
Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I’d like 
to rise today to speak to Bill No. 122. And I also would like to 
talk about a book I recently read which is by Princeton 
University Press, written by Harry G. Frankfurt. It is available 
at the Book & Brier Patch. And I hope it’s not offensive to the 
House. This is not and may not have been my choice of title, 
but nevertheless, it is entitled On Bullshit. Once again, I state 
that this may not have been my choice but it was . . . 
 
[13:45] 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order please. I would ask the 
member to use language which is parliamentary and to 
withdraw the offensive word. 
 
Ms. Morin: — Mr. Speaker, it is the title of the book. I 
withdraw the word bullshit and will refer to it as BS from here 
on in, if that pleases the Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order please. I would ask the 
member not to equivocate. Simply withdraw the statement and 
make the appropriate adjustments. Members ought not to do 
something — Order please — indirectly that they are not 
allowed to do directly. The member may continue. 
 
Ms. Morin: — With apologies to the Speaker and to the author, 
I will withdraw the previous statement. 
 
So I rise today to speak to Bill No. 122 which, along with other 
amendments to The Labour Standards Act, repeals the 
legislation more commonly referred to as most additional hours. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I personally and profoundly disappointed with the 
behaviour of the Conservative Sask Party opposition with 
respect to this and any other piece of labour legislation. It has 
become difficult, if not impossible in this province, to have an 
honest discussion about the issues facing working people in 
Saskatchewan. The opposition has embarked on an agenda of 
fear tactics and propaganda that would make Dick Cheney 
blush with shame. 
 
Mr. Speaker, more than 10 years ago, the concept of most 
additional hours was introduced into The Labour Standards Act 
by this Hon. Assembly following thoughtful consultation with 
the stakeholders. It was recognized then that in order to make 
the intention of law a reality, careful consideration would have 
to be given to the implementation of workable and effective 
regulations. I supported that initiative in 1994 as I saw this as a 
reasonable approach to providing some workplace balance for 
part-time workers. 
 
Mr. Speaker, prior to becoming a member of this Assembly, I 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3147 

was classified as a part-time worker in the retail sector. And, 
Mr. Speaker, I have first-hand experience in the vagaries of 
part-time employment. Mr. Speaker, I speak to this Bill because 
I feel very strongly about the issues facing vulnerable workers 
in our society. And I speak to the hope that this Assembly 
would have the courage of conviction to rise up to the 
challenges facing them in the 21st century. 
 
Unfortunately, the opposition’s gift to the great people of 
Saskatchewan is a return to the last century, Mr. Speaker. In 
fact if you look at the rhetoric that is spouted from the 
opposition, you would think that we were having the debate 
about the 8-hour day or prohibitions against child labour — 
debates, Mr. Speaker, that took place over 100 years ago — the 
same fire-and-brimstone-ridden bluster, the same cries of 
killing the economy, closing businesses, and putting workers on 
the street, unemployed and without hope. 
 
Well, Mr. Speaker, none of the fearmongering came to pass 100 
years ago, and I know that it would not have come to pass at 
this juncture either. Mr. Speaker, I place the blame for this 
firmly in the hands of the opposition. Having said that, you may 
wonder why I’m speaking to this legislation . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please. Order please. Order please. The 
member for Regina Walsh Acres. 
 
Ms. Morin: — Having said that, you may wonder why I’m 
speaking to this legislation, legislation that repeals the very 
provisions that I support. Mr. Speaker, this was by no means a 
simple decision. I wrestled with this for many great hours, 
consulted with many friends and colleagues, and searched my 
soul. I cannot change who I am, however, and so I will move 
forward with the optimism that is a great characteristic of so 
many people of this great province. 
 
I take heart, Mr. Speaker, in the creation of the part-time work 
commission and the good works that will come from that. This 
commission will undertake to carefully examine the work life of 
part-time employees and other vulnerable workers. Without the 
opposition derailing this initiative, the commission will be an 
open public dialogue that even the opposition should be 
satisfied with. The commission will be structured to ensure that 
part-time employees will have protection and anonymity so 
they can come freely forward to share their experiences in a 
way that is meaningful. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as representatives of the people of this great 
province, how can we appeal to young people to stay here, to 
build their lives here, to start and raise families here, to grow 
old and prosper here, if we can’t embrace and sustain even a 
modest improvement to the minimum labour standards of this 
province to provide for a living wage? 
 
Mr. Speaker, we are at a fork in the road. If we take the path 
advocated by the Conservative Party opposite, then we are 
abandoning the option of choice for part-time workers to 
regularize their employment. However, Mr. Speaker, if we take 
a path more favourable to vulnerable workers, we will have 
begun to speak to and for the young worker, the single parent, 
the working poor, and to those who want and deserve a 
reasonable chance to get a sense of optimism for a better future. 
 

It is so important, Mr. Speaker, that this process be open and 
far-reaching in its scope. I hope that the process is allowed to 
complete this important work without the fearmongering and 
rhetoric that characterizes every single initiative that involves 
working people in this province. 
 
The reaction of the opposition is predictable but their 
motivation, Mr. Speaker, is unclear. Is it because they don’t 
acknowledge the plight of the vulnerable workers or is it 
because they simply don’t care? 
 
Perhaps they should walk a day in the shoes of a single mom 
struggling to earn enough money so she could stop using 
income supplements. Or perhaps they should experience the 
lack of quality family time a father has with his young family 
because he’s dashing from one part-time job to another seven 
days a week in order to earn enough money to simply feed and 
clothe his family and put a roof over their heads. Or perhaps 
they should feel the uncertainty that a young worker has from 
week to week not knowing what level of hours he or she may 
have; whether he or she may be penalized by his employer for 
raising a concern over occupational health and safety issues. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I have walked in those shoes and I stand in this 
House today challenging each and every member of this 
Assembly to say the same. I believe that I’m the only elected 
member of this House that came to this House as a part-time 
worker. Mr. Speaker, I believe the part-time commission will 
address many of these issues, perhaps eclipsing the initiative 
that was passed in 1994. 
 
In addition, Mr. Speaker, the amendments that are being put 
forward for the other provisions of The Labour Standards Act 
are necessary to clarify the Act. The Act is one of the most 
important pieces of legislation for the working people of this 
province. The average worker should be able to refer to the Act 
and have an understanding of how that legislation applies to 
him or her. These housekeeping amendments will do exactly 
that. 
 
Mr. Speaker, there are inherent differences between the New 
Democratic Party government and the Conservative 
Saskatchewan Party opposition. We govern by and for the 
people and will always look at innovative and meaningful 
solutions to the plight of vulnerable workers in our society. We 
do not simply pay lip service to the audience in attendance on 
any particular day. Our government is committed . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order. The member 
does have the right to be heard. Order. The Chair recognizes . . . 
order. The Chair recognizes the member for Regina Walsh 
Acres. 
 
Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our government is 
committed to the process of the part-time work commission and 
is looking forward to the recommendations. Mr. Speaker, if the 
opposition is sincere in its so-called concern for the best 
solutions to address the acknowledge problems with part-time 
work in Saskatchewan, we should be able to look forward to 
their support in the implementation of the recommendations of 
the part-time work commission. 
 
Mr. Speaker, let us not mark the 100th anniversary of 



3148 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

Saskatchewan by falling prey to arguments and prejudice 
reminiscent of the late days of the 19th century, but rather let 
our actions fulfill our claim to be thoroughly modern people of 
the 21st century. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, it’s a pleasure to rise on third reading of Bill 122. And 
I have to admit, Mr. Speaker, that this is the first time that I 
have risen from my seat to speak on third reading of any Bill in 
14 years. 
 
In fact is, Mr. Speaker, today is only the second time in those 
14 years that I have seen someone take the opportunity to speak 
on third reading. The other time that it happened was back in 
the mid-’90s, Mr. Speaker, when the individual was not present 
in the Assembly at the time of second reading and didn’t have 
the opportunity to speak. 
 
Yet when I look at Bill 122 in Hansard, this Bill went through 
the House on second reading with only one government 
member speaking to the Bill, and that member spoke for one 
paragraph, one very short paragraph, Mr. Speaker. So I guess 
the question is, is why didn’t the members opposite that wanted 
to speak on 122 take the opportunity during second reading 
debate, Mr. Speaker, when there’s an opportunity for the 
member’s statements to have an impact on the determination of 
whether the legislation would pass and whether there would be 
any changes made in committee, Mr. Speaker? So I’m surprised 
that the member opposite didn’t take that opportunity to 
represent her point of view at that particular time, Mr. Speaker. 
 
I do note though, Mr. Speaker, that the member who just spoke 
also voted on May 12, 2005, in favour of Bill 122. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — In fact, Mr. Speaker, this is a Bill 
introduced by her government and which passed unanimously 
in this House. So I’m not sure what the member is rising about 
today to speak on that she couldn’t have spoke on in second 
reading debate, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The member made some comments about the Saskatchewan 
Party in relationship to Bill 122 and most available hours. Well, 
Mr. Speaker, I’m very happy with our association with various 
interest groups around the province on this particular piece of 
legislation. Some of those interest groups, Mr. Speaker, were 
both of the universities, university students, Mr. Speaker, the 
co-ops of this province, the cities of this province, Mr. Speaker, 
First Nations, the credit union system, Mr. Speaker. So, Mr. 
Speaker, I think we’re in very good company on this particular 
piece of legislation that the government introduced, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The member opposite talked about part-time workers. Well, Mr. 
Speaker, we have been pushing this government for years to 
hire full-time nurses rather than populating our system with 
part-time nurses, Mr. Speaker. I think we have been very clear, 

Mr. Speaker, on the need for regular and full-time employment 
in various sectors especially the health care system which this 
government and that member that spoke previously have 
ignored and done nothing about, Mr. Speaker. This is a good 
piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, and needs to pass. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The question before the Assembly is the 
motion moved by the Minister of Labour that Bill 122, The 
Miscellaneous Labour Statutes Amendment Act, 2005 be now 
read the third time and passed under its title. Is the Assembly 
ready for the question? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Question. 
 
The Speaker: — Is it the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the 
motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — The motion is carried. Call in the members 
for a standing vote.

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Qu’Appelle Valley. 
 

Salute to HMCS Regina 
 
Hon. Mr. Wartman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
2005 marks the 10th anniversary of the commissioning of Her 
Majesty’s Canadian Ship Regina, one of twelve Halifax-class 
patrol frigates in the Canadian Navy. 
 
Whenever and wherever Regina sails she carries a little bit of 
her namesake city with her: the main passageways are Albert 
Street and Victoria Avenue; the ship’s canteen is located on 
Scarth Street Mall. They display two murals of Regina 
landscapes by renowned Regina artist David Butt. The murals 
are framed with old banisters from Regina’s Central Collegiate. 
They proudly display an official Mountie silhouette on the 
bridge wing. Mr. Speaker, you can even buy a Bushwakker beer 
in the junior ranks’ mess. And one of the proudest members of 
the crew is their mascot, Able Seaman Gunner Gopher, 
Gainer’s seagoing cousin. 
 
Last week I had the privilege of meeting the captain of HMCS 
Regina, Commander Joe Sipos, and several members of his 
crew who were making a namesake-city visit to our capital. 
While they were here they visited seven schools, the veteran’s 
ward of the Wascana hospital, and the children’s ward of the 
Regina General Hospital. They presented a $3,000 cheque to 
the Hospitals of Regina Foundation to support pediatric 
medicine. They also visited several local businesses, addressed 
Regina City Council, and reported on the activities of the ship 
since their last visit to Regina in November 2003. 
 
In her home port, Esquimalt, BC [British Columbia] and 
everywhere Regina has gone, she has conducted tours 
showcasing the ship, her namesake city, and the province of 
Saskatchewan to thousands of Canadians and non-Canadians in 
ports like Tokyo, Shanghai, and Inchon. 
 
Regina of course is not the only part of Saskatchewan’s naval 
family. Commander Sipos would also want me to acknowledge 
the important work of HMCS Saskatoon, one of twelve 
Kingston-class coastal defence vessels and the contributions of 
Saskatchewan’s two naval reserve divisions HM Ships Queen 
in Regina and Unicorn in Saskatoon. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in wishing fair winds 
and following seas to the officers and sailors of the members of 
Canada’s navy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Northwest. 
 

14th Annual Green Ribbon of Hope Campaign 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
today is National Missing Child Day, a day to raise public 
awareness about the children here in Saskatchewan and across 
Canada who go missing each year. 
 
In Saskatchewan, Child Find Saskatchewan is marking today as 
the 14th annual Green Ribbon of Hope Campaign. The Green 
Ribbon of Hope is recognized as a symbol to remember missing 
children and to seek their safe return. It is also a symbol of the 
thoughts and prayers we extend to the families and friends of 
missing children. 
 
Proceeds from the Green Ribbon Campaign will enable Child 
Find to continue the work that they have done since 1984 in 
locating our missing children, providing educational programs 
on personal safety, and raising awareness about this issue. 
 
I know that throughout Saskatchewan many of us will be 
thinking of Tamara Keepness and join Tamara’s family and 
friends in maintaining hope that Tamara will be found. 
 
I ask all members to join me in marking this very important 
day. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Walsh Acres. 
 

Child Care Week 
 
Ms. Morin: — Mr. Speaker, May 22 to 28 is Child Care Week 
in Saskatchewan, a time set aside to recognize the importance 
of high quality, accessible, and affordable child care and the 
thousands of dedicated people who provide that care in 
communities throughout our province. 
 
Mr. Speaker, on any given day parents entrust the care, safety, 
and nurturing of their children to others. These trusted others 
may be called childhood educators, caregivers, child care 
providers, or babysitters. Whatever they choose to be called, 
Mr. Speaker, they have a tremendous impact on the health, 
happiness, and safety of our children now and into the future, 
and for this they deserve our thanks and recognition. 
 
Mr. Speaker, two years ago, our Premier announced Child Care 
Saskatchewan, a four-year initiative to develop 1,200 licensed 
child care spaces. This announcement represented the largest 
investment in child care in the history of this province. And I 
am pleased to say that about 700 of those spaces, half of which 
are subsidized, are now available to Saskatchewan parents. 
 
The beginning of a new provincial strategy for early learning 
and child care announced April 7 includes development of 500 
more child care spaces, including 250 previously announced as 
part of Child Care Saskatchewan. Mr. Speaker, we are 
extremely pleased to be working with child care providers in 
this province to ensure that all children are well cared for. 



3154 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

I ask all members to join me in expressing appreciation to all 
the dedicated individuals who each day work to shape and 
nurture our children in providing them with high-quality child 
care. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Humboldt. 
 

Lanigan Captures 2005 Pepsi Cup 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I 
hope that the member from Carrot River Valley is paying close 
attention, and soon he’ll know why. A group of small-town 
girls have proven that they’ve got what it takes to play in the 
big leagues. On the morning of May 16 to the surprise of some 
powerful teams from larger city centres, the Lanigan Blue 
Volleyball Team captured the 2005 Women’s Pepsi Juvenile 
Cup at Calgary, Alberta. 
 
The girls who come from a school of only 168 students played a 
lot of challenging games, and their final match was against the 
Kodiaks from Prince George, BC. They lost the first set and 
tensions were high, but for the next two sets their feisty spirit, 
team co-operation, and never-say-die attitude prevailed. The 
Lanigan Blues demonstrated that small-town Saskatchewan 
determination is something to be contended with. 
 
I would like to congratulate all the players. Carlie Anderson, 
Kyla Hendry, Alissa Hoehn, Amy Schmidt, Chelsea Cain, 
Janessa Attfield, Janelle Ewen, Charisa Innes, Bethany Ediger, 
and Caitlan Jantz. And we mustn’t forget their capable and 
dedicated coaches, Edie Conly and Lindi Stroeder. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Elphinstone. 
 

Cathedral Village Arts Festival 2005 
 
Mr. McCall: — Mr. Speaker, this week one of the largest 
community events in Canada, the Cathedral Village Arts 
Festival, is under way in the heart of Regina. This is the 14th 
annual Cathedral Village Arts Festival, a six-day celebration of 
arts, culture, and community. This year’s theme, Faces and 
Places, pays particular tribute to the diverse people in our 
neighbourhoods. 
 
Mr. Speaker, more than 35,000 people of all ages and 
backgrounds come out every year to take part in the festival. 
One of the highlights is a six and a half block long street fair 
with 258 craft and food booths, the largest craft sale of its kind 
in Saskatchewan. Mr. Speaker, there is something going on for 
everyone every night this week. There’ll be local musicians, 
traditional buskers, First Nations dancing and storytelling, 
theatre performances, orchestras, fire dancers, poetry, and 
much, much more. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it takes a tight-knit community to organize and 
host the festival. This community truly does have the virtues of 
a village — diverse neighbourhoods, small-business people, 

workers, artists, musicians, and schoolchildren. Anyone 
walking down 13th Avenue these days can just feel the sense of 
fun and co-operation. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the arts festival is always a great success and 
much credit goes to the organizing committee, the sponsors, and 
all the volunteers for their dedication, hard work, and support. I 
encourage everyone to come on down to Cathedral Village this 
week for a good time and some great faces and places. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker.

McHappy Day in Canada 
 
Ms. Eagles: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
Wednesday, May 18 was McHappy Day across Canada. All 
McDonald’s restaurants across the nation participated in this 
effort to support Ronald McDonald House. 
 
I, along with many dignitaries and business people, had the 
pleasure of working at the McDonald’s restaurants in Estevan. 
We had a lot of fun and we now realize how important their 
work as a team is. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the McDonald’s restaurants in Estevan raised 
$3,750 and across Canada a total of $2.5 million was raised for 
Ronald McDonald House. And we all know how worthwhile 
these houses are as they are support for families of sick 
children. And, Mr. Speaker, all too often we forget the 
tremendous struggles families face when they have a sick child 
and we should be very grateful for the initiative that the 
McDonald’s restaurant chain has taken to meet the needs in 
their communities. And this is certainly a true example of 
giving back. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Estevan managers, Tim and 
Chris Jenish, their staff, and especially Cheryl Irvine who I 
worked with. I ask all members to join me in congratulating and 
thanking McDonald’s restaurants and all their customers for 
their generosity. Thank you.

Meadow Lake Author on Jury for Giller Prize 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The Giller 
Prize is one of the most prestigious literary honours in Canada. 
Founded in 1994 by Jack Rabinovitch with the assistance from 
such notable figures in Canadian letters as Mordecai Richler 
and Alice Munro, the prize is dedicated to recognizing 
excellence in Canadian literature. 
 
Each year the Giller Prize awards $25,000 to the author of the 
best Canadian novel or short story collection published in 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3155 

English. Mr. Speaker, I’m extremely pleased to say that the 
author Warren Cariou, who was born and raised in Meadow 
Lake and whose writing is very much informed by connection 
to his community, has been named as one of the jurists for this 
year’s Giller Prize. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Warren Cariou received his undergraduate degree 
from the University of Saskatchewan and went on to earn his 
Ph.D. [Doctor of Philosophy] from the University of Toronto. 
He has published two books: a collection of novellas called The 
Exalted Company of Roadside Martyrs, and a memoir entitled 
Lake of the Prairies that won the 2002 Drainie-Taylor Prize for 
biography and was short listed for the 2004 Charles Taylor 
Prize. 
 
Mr. Speaker, being asked to sit on the jury of the very 
prestigious Giller Prize speaks directly to Mr. Cariou’s own 
skills as a writer, and to the respect other members of the 
Canadian writing community have for his literary judgment and 
of course for his work. I congratulate Warren Cariou on all his 
achievements and I know the community of Meadow Lake 
congratulates him and wishes him every success into the future, 
Mr. Speaker.

ORAL QUESTIONS

Misuse of Funds in Environment Department 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Provincial Auditor issued a scathing report identifying up to 
a half a million dollars in fraudulent payments in the 
Department of Environment. His report detailed hundreds of 
unauthorized payments without proper documentation, to 
fictitious businesses for good and services that were never 
received. This went undetected, Mr. Speaker, for some six 
years. 
 
Mr. Speaker, to the minister: how on earth did that happen? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, we take this matter very 
seriously in the department too. We’ve worked very hard to 
ensure this kind of thing has stopped. It has stopped. We’ve put 
instruments in place, actions into place, to make sure this kind 
of thing doesn’t happen again. We’ve worked with the auditor. 
Since our department discovered the misuse of public funds in 
early December of last year we have acted, Mr. Speaker, and we 
will continue to act to improve our accountability. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Mr. Speaker, the auditor found 200 payments 
totalling $260,000 for goods and services that were never 

received — things like meeting rooms, equipment rentals, 
catering, training, travel, and translation service. Six years and 
$260,000 lost, Mr. Speaker. The department never received any 
of these services. 
 
How does the minister and his officials miss something like 
that? How can the department spend $260,000 of taxpayers’ 
hard-earned dollars and not receive any services, Mr. Speaker? 
How did that minister allow that to happen for such a length of 
time? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Well, Mr. Speaker, we take it seriously 
that we take public money and invest it to make sure our 
environment is protected. To that end, over the last two years 
we’ve worked very hard to ensure that services are provided to 
meet our mandate. Mr. Speaker, we reorganized our department 
last year to ensure accountability. To that end, Mr. Speaker, this 
was discovered by our department in December. Then we 
approached the comptroller, the auditor, about this suspicious 
misuse of funding. And so we can assure the public and the 
citizens of Saskatchewan that we are taking all steps necessary 
to make sure this does not happen again. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Mr. Speaker, the auditor raised some very serious 
questions about how payments were authorized in the first 
place, Mr. Speaker. And he said in his report, and I quote: 
 

Employees at Environment routinely instructed the 
Department of Finance to send signed cheques to 
Environment without documenting the . . . 

 
The Speaker: — Order. Order please. Order please. Order 
please. Order please. The member for Last Mountain . . . Order 
please. The member for Last Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The auditor said in his 
report, and I quote: 
 

Employees at Environment routinely instructed the 
Department of Finance to send signed cheques to 
Environment without documenting the reasons for such 
requests. Accounting staff at Environment gave these 
cheques to employees . . . [who] had . . . [initially 
requested the cheques, Mr. Speaker]. 
 

Why did the minister and his department authorize payment 
without documentation? And why were these cheques given 
back to department employees instead of being sent directly to 
the suppliers, Mr. Speaker? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 



3156 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — While we appreciate the good work of the 
auditor, we are working on implementing all the 
recommendations. It is important to get the facts straight, and 
that’s what the auditor has done. There is a criminal 
investigation taking place. 
 
But what’s more important, Mr. Speaker, and for the people of 
Saskatchewan, that we assure that those who are responsible are 
held accountable and that this kind of thing doesn’t happen 
again. And to that end, Mr. Speaker, we have taken action. We 
will continue to improve the accountability processes in our 
department. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Mr. Speaker, the auditor identified problems 
within the Department of Environment as far back as 1998, Mr. 
Speaker. And nothing was done to correct those inadequacies in 
their departmental functions, Mr. Speaker. The auditor 
identified such practices as poor segregation of duties and 
expense monitoring, employees approving their own purchases, 
Mr. Speaker, employees knowing their supervisors’ passwords, 
cheques being issued without proper documentation, and worst 
of all, Mr. Speaker, cheques being sent to department 
employees instead of to the suppliers of the goods and services, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as I said, the auditor has been warning about these 
problems for quite a number of years. But his recommendations 
were ignored. I would like that minister to answer why they 
didn’t act on the auditor’s recommendations sooner. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, let’s get the facts straight. 
The recommendations were not ignored. We’ve been working 
with the auditor. We take his work very seriously and we work 
to support his findings. They were not ignored. To that end, the 
five recommendations, we are acting to put them into place. 
Last year we reorganized our department to make sure this kind 
of thing doesn’t happen. We are on top of this. We take this 
very seriously, and we will make sure this kind of thing stops 
now. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Mr. Speaker, the minister said that corrective 
actions were taken and proper financial reporting policies were 
put in place. What the problem was, Mr. Speaker, that those 
policies were not followed. And the department had no 
mechanism to follow up and see if the policies were being 
properly followed, Mr. Speaker. And the auditor says that in his 

report, and I quote, 
 

. . . employees did not always follow these policies . . . 
[and] Senior management has not established practices to 
assess how well employees . . . [followed the] established 
policies. 

 
Mr. Speaker, so the minister may say that there was changes 
made, but the employees were not instructed and there was no 
provision made to see that employees would follow those 
changes, Mr. Speaker. Why didn’t the minister and his officials 
follow up on those recommendations of the auditor? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Well, Mr. Speaker, we have followed up 
on those recommendations. And it’s key to the success of our 
department that accountability is there. And we see that and we 
know that. 
 
To that end, Mr. Speaker, we’ve taken several steps. As I 
mentioned, last year we reorganized the department. We have a 
new delegated signing authority that was in place last June, 
2004. Now to approve new vendors, support staff can no longer 
initiate these activities. Branch head approval is required. We 
have put into place, we’ve hired a new person in terms of our 
internal audit. 
 
Mr. Speaker, these are just a few examples of the kind of things 
we’ve done to make sure this kind of thing does not happen 
again. Mr. Speaker, we have acted. We take this very seriously, 
and we will continue to work to make sure this stops.

Criminal Reference Checks for the Public Service’s 
Employment Screening 

 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the auditor 
says that criminal background checks would be helpful when 
hiring certain employees. However, the Public Service 
Commission has not implemented this policy. Back on February 
1, Mr. Speaker, the Saskatchewan Party called for retroactive 
background checks for any government employees who handle 
money or are responsible for children. What is this government 
doing in this regard, Mr. Speaker? Will the NDP [New 
Democratic Party] implement criminal background checks for 
positions responsible for money and children? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister 
Responsible for the Public Service Commission. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
First of all, I want to indicate to the public that the vast, vast 
majority of public servants in this province complete their work 
with a great deal of integrity, honesty, and diligence, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3157 

Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Secondly I want to say to the public 
that we take the auditor’s report and his findings extremely 
seriously. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the opposition asked me this question on April 6 
of this year and I indicated at the time that the Public Service 
Commission, along with officials from government 
departments, are reviewing this matter. And I expect to receive 
a report with recommendations on this matter in June.

Payment Verification Procedures in 
Department of Finance 

 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Mr. Speaker, the auditor’s report also 
includes a scathing indictment of lax financial practices in the 
Department of Finance. The auditor says that Finance officials 
routinely approved payment requests without any 
documentation of the reasons for the request. Cheques are then 
issued and returned directly to the employee who requested 
them — not to the supplier. The auditor says, and I quote, Mr. 
Speaker: 
 

. . . [returned] signed cheques to those who initiated . . . 
cheque requests increased the . . . [risks] of [the] loss of 
public money. 

 
This practice was responsible for the fraudulent payments 
identified by the Provincial Auditor. Mr. Speaker, that’s an 
astounding statement. According to the Provincial Auditor, the 
Department of Finance, their financial approval process actually 
led to the loss of taxpayers’ money. Can the minister explain 
how he allowed this to happen under his watch? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to 
thank the member for the question and state at the outset that no 
misappropriation of funds, no fraud, is acceptable in our 
society. Fraud avoidance is a serious challenge — not just for 
government organizations but also for businesses and for 
private organizations, Mr. Speaker. We always have to be on 
guard. 
 
The cases that have been identified in government I believe are 
isolated cases; they are not connected. Nevertheless we should 
be concerned and on guard. And I think that the Finance 
department has taken steps towards that end, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Mr. Speaker, I’m sure everyone in the 
province would want a machine that spits out money with no 
accountability. I’m sure Saskatchewan farmers would like 
access to the Finance department’s centralized payment system. 
I’m sure most people in Saskatchewan . . . 

The Speaker: — Order please, members. Order. The member 
for Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Mr. Speaker, I’m sure most people in 
Saskatchewan would like to benefit from this minister and this 
government’s Midas touch. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the auditor says cheques were given to the 
Department of Environment without documenting the reasons 
for the cheques. Mr. Speaker, why is the Department of Finance 
issuing cheques without proper documentation and is this 
indeed happening in other departments at the present time? 
 
[14:45] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, the process in 
government is that a branch of government and a department 
identifies a need to issue a cheque to a supplier or some other 
payee. That then is documented within the department. The 
Department of Finance then issues a cheque. In most cases 
those cheques are sent directly to the payees or the supplier and 
that’s the way it works. 
 
Now there may be instances where the department seeks to 
attach the cheque to some other documentation that is to be 
provided to the person who provided the invoice in the first 
place. And that is the system and we allow for that. I might 
point out that over the course of the last seven years, I believe 
there have been something like 5 million transactions by the 
Department of Finance. I think there’s questions with respect to 
about 550 of those. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Silver Springs. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Mr. Speaker, we all know how the 
system is supposed to work but in this particular instance 
suppliers were not even identified. Mr. Speaker, with the 
Finance minister’s centralized payment system, employees can 
approve their own purchases online without detection. There is 
no checking of authority and no checking of approval, and the 
money is sent to the employee who requested the payment 
instead of to the supplier. Mr. Speaker, this just may be the tip 
of the iceberg. This may be happening in Environment and in 
other departments. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this system creates all kinds of opportunities for 
abuse and at least one employee has abused the system to the 
tune of one-half of a million taxpayers’ dollars. Mr. Speaker, 
what is the minister doing to stop this from happening again and 
what is the minister doing to restore the public confidence in 
this government and in this Department of Finance? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Finance. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Mr. Speaker, the issue of cheques 
to payees in Saskatchewan was decentralized 20 years or so ago 
as I understand it. Prior to that time all invoices would have 
been checked by the Department of Finance. The system we 



3158 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

have now is that the departments are responsible for ensuring 
that payments are going to go to — for valid reasons — to valid 
payees. We issue the cheques upon request. That is the system 
we have. Again during the course of the last year or the last 
seven years we had about 5 million transactions. There’s about 
550 that are in question. 
 
Having said that, Mr. Speaker, the Department of Finance has a 
system of internal audits to check through departments. We also 
have the Provincial Auditor, also has responsibilities to report 
to the Legislative Assembly. And that is the system that we 
have, Mr. Speaker.

Property Tax for Businesses 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
business owners in my constituency have long-standing and 
serious concerns with the assessment system used to calculate 
property taxes. 
 
Recent studies support the conclusion that gross inequities exist 
between what businesses pay for similar properties in various 
parts of this province. A big part of the problem is the 
assessment system. Mr. Speaker, what has the minister done to 
address these inequities that have identified? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
Government Relations. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
think as the members opposite know, we have an assessment 
system that’s run by an arm’s-length, independent operation, an 
agency called the Saskatchewan Assessment Management 
Agency. It runs with a board of directors, Mr. Speaker — a 
board of directors that’s accountable to municipalities, to rural 
municipalities, and also to the commercial sector, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And in answer to that very specific question, I think the 
member opposite is aware that just a few weeks ago my final 
appointment to the board of the Saskatchewan Assessment 
Management Agency was a member of the commercial sector. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Wood 
River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Speaker, it may be arm’s 
length but there’s four government members on the board, so 
I’m sure there’s some influence from the government side of 
the House into the SAMA [Saskatchewan Assessment 
Management Agency] agency. 
 
Mr. Speaker, recently I met with several business owners from 
my constituency and they find it extremely strange that 
apartment properties owned privately in Assiniboia and 
Gravelbourg are assessed at a much higher value that those 
owned by the province of Saskatchewan’s Housing 

Corporation. This means that the government-owned buildings 
have the ability to charge significantly lower rents due to the 
difference in assessments. 
 
Mr. Speaker, it’s bad enough that the private sector has to 
compete with the NDP. To the minister, why is the assessment 
system being used to force unfair competition between 
government and the private sector? This is basically a 
two-tiered system, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Government Relations. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
think the question indicates a fundamental lack of knowledge of 
how an assessment is done in the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
SAMA is indeed an independent agency. It’s established by 
legislation of this Chamber. SAMA establishes the rules and 
principles used in determining assessment values. These rules 
and principles are set out in an assessment manual adopted by 
the SAMA Board of Directors and discussed at an annual 
meeting of stakeholders, including municipal leaders — urban 
and rural — and, Mr. Speaker, the independent assessors in the 
province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Wood 
River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Speaker, to the minister, you 
should know that SAMA works within the framework of the 
legislation which is passed by the NDP government. Mr. 
Speaker, over one year ago the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business highlighted the gap between business and 
residential property tax rates. It also highlighted the wide 
variation in taxes paid for properties of similar value across 
Saskatchewan. The federation called for more stable, 
market-based assessment methodology. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in the interest of fairness what steps have been 
taken to develop a better property assessment system in this 
province? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of 
Government Relations. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — And again thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m 
just amazed when he talks about the legislation established by 
this government. We will admit that we’ve amended the system 
to make it better, but the Assessment Management Agency was 
created in 1986 by a government other than this one, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The amendments that we’ve made over the years have indeed 
improved the system, Mr. Speaker. And it should be pointed out 
that the board of SAMA has been working very hard to 
implement the income approach for the next round of 
revaluation, an approach that’s been asked for by the business 
community, municipalities, and others throughout the province, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3159 

We are reviewing a new quality assurance process. We’re 
moving to a shorter revaluation cycle and we’re moving to 
improve the appeal process, Mr. Speaker. We are taking great 
steps to ensure fairness and equity in the assessment system in 
the province.

Security Measures for Provincial Parks 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I don’t know 
how you can do a reassessment by government when it’s 
supposed to be at arm’s length. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have all heard about the rowdiness that 
occurred over the long weekend in some of our provincial 
parks. Yesterday’s call-in shows were jammed with horror 
stories of violence, vandalism, and assaults on police officers. 
Some 213 charges were laid and damages at one site are 
estimated to be as much as $20,000. 
 
In the wake of all this destruction, Moose Mountain Provincial 
Park was relatively quiet this year, Mr. Speaker, because of new 
enforcement measures. And you would think the Environment 
minister would be more than happy to extend some of these 
measures to the other parks. But apparently not, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Why won’t the Environment minister be extending these 
enforcement measures to the other provincial parks to prevent 
such incidents in the future? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. We 
did have a great success in Moose Mountain Park this past May 
long weekend. And it was a, you know, a combination of a 
community working together, business people — in fact we had 
students working on how we make the plan — a combination of 
enforcement. Some simple rules like no glass containers, that 
type of thing, a volleyball tournament — some really good 
things for young people to be involved in. So this is a good plan 
but not all plans fit all parks. 
 
And so what we have to do is make sure what’s appropriate for 
the park will fit. And so we’re taking a look at that. It was a 
pilot project. It seemed to work really well in Moose Mountain. 
We’re very happy about it. We are concerned about what 
happened in some of the other parks, but we’ll take the lessons 
learned from that. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m sure that a 
good many of the people in Moose Mountain were really 

interested in the night volleyball, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, in one case RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police] officers were pelted with bottles. In another case RCMP 
officers were pushed into the lake. At other campgrounds, 
bathroom doors were kicked in and the facilities were literally 
ripped apart. 
 
In Moose Mountain Provincial Park, an enforcement . . . a pilot 
project of sorts did its job in reducing this kind of behaviour. 
And as the minister mentioned, it included a ban on glass 
bottles. It also included limiting the number of campers at a site 
to four, identifying campers with a wristband, and requiring 
those renting a site to be a minimum of 18 years of age or older. 
If these measures worked at Moose Mountain Provincial Park 
this year, Mr. Speaker, why is the Minister of the Environment 
so reluctant to extend this to the other parks in the province? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of the 
Environment. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — You know, Mr. Speaker, I find this 
interesting. We’ve got to get the facts straight too. They’re 
saying some things worked, some things didn’t. We’ll take a 
look. We’ll evaluate it, but we want to evaluate it with the 
people who set up the initiative, the changes, and what fits 
there. We’ll take a look at Emma Lake or Echo Lake, but, you 
know, it’s really important that many people got out, had a 
good, good weekend. 
 
And I also want to say, and I want to say to the employees that 
worked hard to make sure the May long weekend was a good, a 
good time for many of the park visitors who were there, they 
did a good job along with the RCMP. This is a tough thing. This 
is a shared responsibility as well, Mr. Speaker. And this is why 
we need to take a look at the individual campgrounds, parks. 
What will work best in that area? We’ve learned a lot of good 
lessons, and we’ll take it from there. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Cannington. 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It would be 
much more impressive if the minister would stand up and say 
what worked in Moose Mountain was good and we’ll take a 
serious look at implementing it in other areas instead of saying 
well, Mr. Speaker, we have to look at this; we have to give 
considerations. Something worked here, Mr. Speaker. 
 
One of the other things that’s happening at Moose Mountain 
Provincial Park, Mr. Speaker, is that the local bars and hotels 
are providing transportation service from their establishments 
back to the park campsites, Mr. Speaker. But unfortunately the 
Minister of Environment and his department will not allow 
those transportation, the vans, into the campsites to drop people 
off so that it keeps the people who may be drinking and driving 
off the roads, Mr. Speaker, and provides a safer environment. 
Why doesn’t the minister allow those specific vans that are 
transporting people back to their campsites into the campsites 
instead of forcing them to drop them off at the park gates, Mr. 
Speaker?

work, we will put into place. This is going to be a phenomenal 
year in our parks, Mr. Speaker. The centennial’s here. The parks 
will be a centrepiece of our centennial celebration and we’re 
going to make sure everyone has a safe, enjoyable time in 
Saskatchewan in our parks. Thank you very much.

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 
 

General Revenue Fund 
Government Relations 

Vote 30 
 
Subvote (GR01) 
 
The Chair: — Order. I call to order the Committee of Finance. 
The first item before the committee is the consideration of 
estimates for the Department of Government Relations starting 
on page 71 of the Estimates book. And I would recognize the 
Minister of Government Relations to introduce his officials. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am very pleased 
to be back again in front of Committee of Finance. I have with 
me today the deputy minister of Government Relations, Harvey 
Brooks. I have the assistant deputy minister of municipal 
relations, Maryellen Carlson; executive director of policy 
development, John Edwards; executive director, grants 
administration, provincial-municipal relations, Russ Krywulak. 
I have the executive director, finance and management services, 
Wanda Lamberti. I also have, sitting behind the bar, director of 
grants administration, Doug Morcom, and the acting executive 
director, community planning, Ralph Leibel. 
 
The Chair: — Thank you, Minister. Central Management and 
Services, (GR01). I recognize the member for Wood River. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, 

Minister and officials. 
 
Before I get started on the current stuff that we were addressing 
earlier on in question period, Mr. Minister, in our last meeting 
or the meeting prior to that there was some questions around the 
forest fringe area that my colleague from Rosthern-Shellbrook 
was addressing and it had to do with taxes being collected by 
RMs [rural municipality] on provincial Crown land. And as I 
recall your answer to that, you had stated — and this is why I’m 
asking the question — that some of the municipalities were 
given authority to collect taxes on provincial Crown land. Is 
that correct? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for the question. 
I’ll be very specific about the way the system works for the 
member opposite. All rural municipalities have the authority to 
tax land that is permitted or leased from the Crown. The 
legislation that provides for municipal tax powers on permit or 
leased land also provides local municipalities to exempt from 
taxation that tax or to pro-rate it. So the RMs in question do 
have the ability to pro-rate the tax on that permitted land based 
on, should they wish to, the number of days or weeks or months 
that that land is used. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Well my 
concern was, as you could tell, we were talking about forest 
fringe area at the time. And I just wanted to make sure that it 
was equal throughout the whole province. And from your 
answer it’s equal for all RMs throughout the province. 
 
Now, Mr. Minister, I want to go back into what we discussed 
briefly in question period is the assessment system. And I think 
all of us are getting quite a number of calls on assessments and 
the fairness of how the assessment is being done in various 
areas. And I know that your statement earlier is that SAMA is 
an arm’s-length organization. But looking at the 2004 annual 
report, in the report it gives the board of directors, a 
nine-member board of directors. Two members are nominated 
by the Minister of Government Relations to the board. 
 
And then in addition, in 2004 there were two more members 
from the provincial government that were assigned to the board 
— which comes to a total of four government members — but 
the way it’s stated in the annual report, two more members from 
the provincial government. I’d like the minister to explain the 
four members from the government and who they are, for the 
record. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you again for the question. It does 
give me an opportunity to discuss the governance of SAMA 
which is indeed an arm’s-length agency of government. As the 
member is probably aware, in the last time we were together in 
this Chamber we amended the legislation, and the board now 
currently operating is 11 board members. That was changed in 
the last sitting of the Chamber. 
 
Of those 11 board members, six are appointed by local taxing 
authorities. Two are directly appointed by SUMA 
[Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association]. Two are 
directly appointed by SARM [Saskatchewan Association of 
Rural Municipalities], and two are directly appointed by the 
Saskatchewan School Boards Association. The province 
appoints five members to the board. One of those members, by 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3161 

legislation, is the chairperson, and the minister appoints only 
after consultation with SUMA, SARM, and the SSBA 
[Saskatchewan School Boards Association] for that specific 
position. 
 
The new legislation allows for the Minister of Learning to 
appoint one member to the board. That’s in recognition of the 
additional dollars that are now being provided for the operation 
of the agency, dollars available to the agency from the 
Department of Learning. And then the Minister of Government 
Relations has two other appointments to make. 
 
And I just want to indicate, as I did during question period, one 
of those appointments was to appoint a representative of the 
commercial sector as suggested by the business community, in 
particular the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce. That 
diversifies the interests of the board because there were no 
business or commercial representatives on the board prior to 
that appointment. And secondly, the other appointment that I’ve 
made was a former executive member of the Saskatchewan 
Association of Rural Municipalities — he just left the board last 
year — and I appointed him to the executive, to the board. 
 
So that would mean that the board is pretty evenly balanced in 
favour . . . I guess I could say that the board is balanced in 
favour of the local taxing authorities, and there is considerable 
consultation with the municipal and school board associations 
prior to any of these appointments. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well thank you, Mr. Minister. I have 
that in the annual report, all of the governance and the board 
members. I guess my concern is, if we have what you stated, 
five members appointed by the Minister of Government 
Relations, my concern is how much influence that creates in 
decision making within SAMA. 
 
I mean it’s pretty obvious to an awful lot of people, if you 
overload a board . . . although you can state that it’s equal as far 
as urban, rural, and whatnot, but when you’ve got government 
members that are appointed in the board, how much influence 
that it would have on the decision-making process of the board. 
And I’m wondering . . . it’s very easy to say it’s an arm’s-length 
organization. But when you have five members appointed by 
yourself, my concern is how much influence actually is coming 
from the government side of the House into the SAMA board, 
and I wonder if you’d comment on that. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — I’m more than happy to comment on that 
particular question. And to a certain extent, I’m sorry that 
members of the opposition would even consider that, given the 
independence of the board, that there would be some suspicion 
that this government would try to influence it. 
 
The SAMA board was specifically created to operate at arm’s 
length. When we look at the individuals who are appointed to 
the board, let’s make sure that we recognize that each and every 
one of them comes from a sector or a part of the community 
that’s not associated with government. These are not MLAs 
[Member of the Legislative Assembly]. They are not 
government workers. 
 
There was at one point a representative of the assessment 
services, almost always an employee of the board. The last 

amendments that we made specifically removed the employee 
of the board from the board in order to ensure that there was 
greater independence and independence of the operation of the 
board. 
 
I think that it is very clear — given the fact that the chairperson 
is appointed only after consultation with the SUMA, SARM, 
and SSBA representatives and the fact that I went to great 
lengths in my most recent appointments to ensure that there was 
consultation with both the municipal sector and the business 
community prior to those appointments — that there should be 
no suspicion whatsoever that this board is doing anything other 
than acting completely at arm’s length. 
 
I also might add that, as I had indicated in an answer to a 
question from one of the other opposition members last time 
about did I have confidence in the board, I believe that the work 
of the board — which is at the end of the day simply to provide 
fair and equitable assessments across the province, to ensure 
that there’s a system in place to provide fair and equitable 
assessments across the province — I have complete confidence 
in the board and the staff at SAMA in doing the job that they’ve 
been asked to do. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Minister, I have a couple of 
concerns when you say, consulted. We do know that there’s a 
track record of your side of the House in consultations and also 
where suspicions arise when you appoint two more members 
from the provincial government. That’s the exact wording 
stated within the annual report. So I’m sure that you can see 
where suspicions arise if you’re overloading a board with 
government appointed individuals. 
 
And also you’ve stated numerous times that SAMA is an 
arm’s-length board. But in question period, you alluded to the 
fact that how you are making many changes in SAMA. Well if 
you’re arm’s length, how can you be making changes to 
SAMA? 
 
[15:15] 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — If the member opposite remembers what 
his question was, it was directly to the Minister of Government 
Relations implying that within my responsibilities, I wasn’t 
doing anything. I wanted to indicate that the SAMA board has 
made some great steps forward and, in fact, very supportive by 
this government in what’s being done. 
 
But also, if I could take the member through some of the 
responsibilities that exist by the board itself, let me just indicate 
two things before I answer the question more directly. First of 
all, there’s a relationship here between the independent board, 
SAMA and Government Relations. Each of us have 
responsibilities in carrying out our duties. 
 
Number one, SAMA is an independent assessment agency 
established by legislation under the direction of a board of 
directors. That board meets regularly. They have an annual 
general meeting with their stakeholders. That is, representatives 
of municipalities and school divisions attend and question the 
work that SAMA has done and provides advice to the board. 
Again I repeat from my previous question, the goal is to provide 
fair and equitable assessments across the province. 



3162 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

Government Relations’ responsibilities include examining the 
funding requests that are made in relation to four key points 
about what their job is. And I’ll spell those out in a moment. 
Government Relations exists in this relationship to ensure 
financial accountability. Government Relations will review the 
five-year plans to ensure sustainability of the agency. 
 
And most importantly — and this goes directly to the point that 
the member opposite raises — Government Relations works 
with the board on any legislative amendments discussed by the 
board. In other words, annual general meetings provides advice 
to the board, reviews the process, and they report back to 
government on what to go forward with. 
 
There have been . . . And my question said we, meaning that 
this team of SAMA, the independent agency, and Government 
Relations responsible for the agency have been proceeding with 
implementation of the income approach for the year 2009 
revaluation, reviewing the new quality assurance process which 
SAMA board is putting in place, moving to a shorter 
revaluation cycle — this will indeed require some amendments 
to the legislation — improving the appeal process which we’ve 
been asked to do both on the political side and within the board. 
And of course in addition to that, we are also reviewing the 
funding of SAMA, and we’re reviewing the impacts of the most 
recent 2005 revaluation. 
 
So when I talk about . . . When the member asks the question 
about what is government doing about this arm’s-length 
relationship, I’m indicating to the member that we are assuming 
the role that we play, the responsibility that we have in terms of 
the oversight of SAMA, not in the legal sense of the word but in 
terms of the jurisdictional sense of the word. And secondly to 
ensure that there’s some accountability in this place for the 
work of this arm’s-length board established by legislation. 
 
So I need to know what they’re doing. I need to provide some 
input when they ask me for legislative changes. And I believe 
that we have established a go-forward position that the business 
community, the municipal sector, and the education sector are 
in support of. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Minister, you talked about 
fairness, and that’s what caused this whole issue to come to the 
forefront now. The group that I met with the other day . . . And 
this is from the assessment documentation, and I just want to 
give you some figures. 
 
This is in the town of Gravelbourg. There’s a 12-suite, privately 
owned facility that the value per suite, value per suite 
assessment is $20,316. That’s the valued assessment. It’s rated 
as above average. Construction is wood. 
 
Now the Housing Corporation’s building there is single level. It 
has a garage, and it’s assessed at — it’s above average; it’s 
made of wood — and it’s assessed at $14,088. 
 
Now surely, Mr. Minister, you can see that there’s quite a 
discrepancy between a government Housing Corporation 
assessed value than there is in the privately assessed value of a 
private facility. How can you stand there and say that this is 
fair? 
 

Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you again very much for the 
question. I want to indicate in answering the question that of 
course in every community and in every instance of course the 
information that the assessors carry on isn’t brought forward to 
the minister’s desk. 
 
SAMA operates both as a regulator, an assessor, and it works in 
partnership with independent assessors across the province in 
various communities. What SAMA does primarily is provide 
the guidelines for the assessors to go out and assess. 
Government property and private sector property should not be 
assessed at different rates or under different circumstances. The 
manual exists to support an assessor’s evaluation of an 
individual piece of property. 
 
There is an established appeal process that property owners can 
use if they are not satisfied with their assessments. The appeal 
process will include comparative data. And I certainly 
encourage any member of the public that feels that their 
assessment is not fair and has not been done on an equitable 
basis with other property to use the appeal process that’s in 
place. 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Minister, I know the interested 
parties will be appealing. But that wasn’t an isolated situation 
either in the town of Assiniboia. 
 
I’ll give you another example. Condition ratings are good on 
this building. The privately owned assessment is 22,375 per 
suite, and a comparable suite owned by the government housing 
association is assessed at $17,056. My concern is that there’s a 
little bit of a trend. And that’s just in two towns within my 
constituency. 
 
And that’s what precipitated the question of . . . is there 
something happening that we do not know about? Why would 
these assessments, why would the assessment of 
government-owned Housing Corporation buildings be assessed 
so dramatically much lower when in fact some of them are 
better buildings. And I’m really concerned that there’s a 
two-tiered system here. 
 
Now you have to look at what’s happening in communities such 
as Assiniboia and Gravelbourg. When the assessment goes up 
for these privately owned dwellings, the taxes are obviously 
going to go up because the assessment’s going up, so if that 
happens the rent is going to have to go up. 
 
Now people are going to be moving out of privately owned 
dwellings to go into government dwellings who don’t have a 
high assessment and the rental rates can be lower. And I know 
in some cases, the actual rental rates are lower in the privately 
owned dwellings in these towns. But because of the status of 
the government buildings — like single-level entry is great for 
seniors — the rent is actually more in it, but you pay for the 
convenience — but yet it’s assessed by $8,000 per unit less, and 
that’s the concern of the people out there that own these private 
buildings. And so I would hope that something can be done. 
 
And also I talked to them about the appeal process, and right in 
the appeal book it states that phrases such as, assessment too 
high, are not sufficient. I don’t know what else you can appeal 
it on other than the assessment is too high. And so I don’t know 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3163 

if you have a comment on that, but here you can see a trend 
going; government Housing Corporation facilities are being 
assessed at a much, much lower rate than privately owned 
housing facilities. And yet even in the assessment appeal 
process, it says just because it’s too high it’s not sufficient 
grounds to appeal. 
 
I’m not sure how and what else they can use to appeal other 
than hey, we’re not being dealt a level playing field here. I don’t 
know if you’d comment on that. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for that question 
and sorry for the delay in responding. I was just trying to get 
some additional information about the manual and to confirm of 
course that to the best of my knowledge the SAMA manual 
does not contain a two-tier system. I think it should be very 
clear that the legislation establishing SAMA does not provide 
any role for the minister in determining property assessments 
except through recommendations on property classes and 
percentage of value used to calculate taxable assessments. 
 
For all intents and purposes, the types of questions that the 
member opposite is asking are indeed best directed at the 
members of the SAMA board, or directed from the floor at an 
annual general meeting of SAMA. As I indicated, I have no 
knowledge that the tool that SAMA provides to the assessors — 
which is the manual — would prescribe a different set of rules 
for public property versus private property. The assessment 
manual should provide for equitable and fair assessments across 
the piece. 
 
At the same time I wanted to indicate, to help those preparing 
appeals, a couple of things. The member opposite asked about, 
the person applying for an appeal can’t just use too high an 
assessment as a reason for appeal. The whole purpose of this is 
to establish whether it is fair and equitable. Too high an 
assessment doesn’t mean it’s not fair or equitable; too high can 
mean any number of things. But when there is additional 
information, such as the member has already provided in this 
forum, i.e., there’s comparable data, that is indeed information 
that can be brought forward in an appeal. 
 
I have with me the Appealing Your Property Assessment 
booklet and it simply states that the grounds for the appeal must 
be detailed. This is what the member opposite is indicating. 
Phrases such as assessment too high or assessment too low are 
not sufficient. It is the responsibility of the person making the 
appeal to make a case to the board of revision. And it may be as 
simple as proving the dimensions or measurements are wrong, 
or that a classification is not correct, or as complex as proving 
that the value of the property is not fairly assessed compared to 
another property that is similar in nature. 
 
So the onus is on the person making the appeal to convince the 
board, the appeal board, that they have a case. And it’s clearly 
specified in the material that’s provided to anyone 
contemplating an appeal. 
 
[15:30] 
 
Mr. Huyghebaert: — Well, Mr. Minister, I’m sure the 
residents and the owners of these businesses will be pleased to 
hear that, because we’ve gone through the appeal process with 

them. And to me it’s pretty plain that there’s cause for appeal 
when you look at the housing corporation facilities that are 
assessed 8,000 in one case and 5,000 in another case lower, 
lower than the private dwellings of a comparable structure. 
 
So, Mr. Minister, I would hope that there’s not a two-tiered 
system, which you said that there was not. But it’s not of much 
satisfaction to the people that are in competition with the 
government housing corporation facilities there, when there’s 
that much of a variance in the assessment. So I’m encouraging 
them to appeal. 
 
But when you’re competing against the government, sometimes 
it’s a little difficult for an organization to come and compete 
against the government. And using them as an example, say 
well that’s just the way it is. And I don’t think that that’s 
acceptable to these individuals. So I’ll be giving them all of 
your answers and inviting them to appeal. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much. And I do 
encourage any member . . . any individual in the province of 
Saskatchewan who feels that their assessment was not fair, 
equitable to indeed appeal. 
 
I want to stress two things. Number one, that direction to appeal 
is handled by a local board of revision. It is members of that 
particular community that hear that appeal first. Should there be 
further concerns or further problems, it will come to a 
provincial board. But first and foremost, it’s a local board of 
revision that will hear the appeal. Therefore it is people who 
understand the property values within a community that are 
going to make the first decision with regards to that. 
 
And secondly, again I come back to what I had said earlier in 
that the board that develops and creates the manual that 
assessors use is composed of primarily representatives from the 
urban and rural municipal associations and the school board 
association which are the taxing authorities They do meet 
annually with their stakeholders, and issues that indicate that 
the manual that has been prepared to advise assessors in the 
field, if there are problems with that, there are opportunities to 
address that directly to the agency itself. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — Recognize the member from Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Minister, to 
you and your officials, welcome this afternoon. I have a few 
questions that have also arisen as a result of the most recent 
reassessment by SAMA. 
 
As you no doubt are aware, there have been some issues in 
various communities that are sort of specific to that community 
that the most recent assessment has provoked. And I’d like you 
to address some of the problem areas that have arisen as a 
result. 
 
I refer in particular to the community of Maple Creek which has 
experienced a significant increase in assessment in a very 
specific area, in a very small area I might add, south of the 
community of Maple Creek. The term used to describe this area 
is an enhanced neighbourhood. It amounts to half a mile on 
either side of Highway 21 for 3 miles south of the community. 



3164 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

And the assessment on properties in that area has taken a 
tremendous leap — in fact I believe as high as three times the 
previous assessment. 
 
I have a copy of one of the assessment notices that was made 
available to me and the 2004 assessment for this gentleman’s 
property was $87,500. In his case the projected 2005 
assessment is 145,000. That’s not quite double, but his isn’t 
quite as dramatic as some of the others in that particular area. 
And I’d like to ask you, Mr. Minister, is the concept of the 
enhanced neighbourhood something new that SAMA is using 
with this reassessment process in 2005? 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — I thank the member for his question. And 
maybe to answer what appears to be a line of questioning along 
that line, that maybe I can help by repeating what I said earlier. 
The legislation does not provide any role for the minister in 
determining property assessments except through 
recommendations on property classes and percentage of value 
used to calculate taxable assessments. The assessment process 
is indeed a very technical and complex matter which is why 
there’s an agency with an independent board of directors that 
has the responsibility to create the manual that guides the 
assessors throughout the province. 
 
As a result of the authorities and the responsibilities as they’re 
laid out and provided, this is indeed the very type of question 
that the assessors themselves have to answer on a day-to-day 
basis consulting the manual and the board itself, dealing with, 
in preparing the manual. 
 
So I can say I’m not aware of the concept of enhanced 
neighbourhood. It’s not something that comes back to myself as 
a minister. I will deal with matters relating to property classes. 
I’ll deal with matters relating to percentages of value. We’ve 
done that this year. But in terms of the matter that the member 
raises, it’s specific to the decisions made by the board itself. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Well, Mr. Minister, thank you. I heard your 
earlier response and the reason I brought this specific case to 
your attention is that it’s representative of the problem that the 
people that live in the immediate area of Maple Creek are 
experiencing. This is a very small area. It’s, well basically three 
square miles. And right across the road allowance, right across 
the fenceline, you have a different enhanced area with a 
completely different classification and assessment. And then 
you have a larger enhanced area with a different assessment 
again. 
 
And the problem, Mr. Minister, is that nobody seems to 
understand exactly why the properties in that very small area 
are assessed at such a significantly higher rate than the ones 
outside of that immediate three square mile area. And yet they 
might be, you know, in terms of proximity as close to the 
community of Maple Creek as anybody else. They’ll have 
access to all the same services. They all are in the RM of Maple 
Creek. 
 
And when the, you know, when these discrepancies, this 
disparate sort of approach to assessment came to the attention 
of these various neighbours — they started comparing their 
assessment notices — it became blatantly obvious that some 
people were going to be especially hard hit by assessment while 

others across the road were not going to be hurt quite so much. 
 
Now as a result of this you know, this problem, there was a 
large public meeting in the community of Maple Creek last 
night and there were representatives of SAMA in attendance as 
well as one of the board members from my constituency who 
represents the rural area. We had, you know, good 
representation of civic officials and so forth. But when they 
were challenged as to why some of these issues might be in 
play, the response was, well we need your feedback on these 
matters so we can take it to the government and get changes 
made. 
 
Now, Mr. Minister, as you can appreciate, this is exceptionally 
frustrating for people who feel that they’re being unfairly 
assessed and potentially unfairly taxed. They’re taking it to the 
authority that is charged with the responsibility of dealing with 
the assessment issue, and when those people are confronted 
with the issues, they’re saying, well, we’ll take it to the 
government for a decision. And this is a case of throwing 
responsibility back and forth. I mean you’ve said today that 
SAMA is an arm’s-length enterprise, and you don’t get 
involved with those micro decisions. And I’ll take you at your 
word. But somebody has to take responsibility for the way these 
issues develop in these communities. 
 
Now, Mr. Minister, the reality for these people is that even 
though the RM might be able to use the mill rate factors to 
address some of the inequities, the school taxes aren’t going to 
change. And this one gentleman is not going to see any change 
in the value of his property. He’s not going to see any change in 
the configuration of his property, no new buildings, no 
improvements, no renovations or anything else. And yet his 
taxes are going to almost double. And if that is a direct result of 
one or two properties in that very small area having sold for an 
exceptionally high value, everybody down the line is paying a 
price, whether or not they can realize that value if they put their 
own properties on the market. 
 
So we’ve got a situation where you’re trying to address 
inequities through the reassessment process, and I’ll accept that 
at face value. But there are anomalies here where people are 
being hit exceptionally hard. 
 
Now he can go to his appeal board and he can say, you know, 
my assessment’s too high, but all the other material facts are the 
same as they were under the previous assessment. And his 
appeal will be denied. 
 
So, Mr. Minister, we need some attention to these very, you 
know, sort of unique and specific circumstances that have 
developed. And I’m sure if it’s happening in Maple Creek, it’s 
probably happening in other small communities and maybe 
even larger communities all around the province. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for that question 
and to a certain extent for the direction that you’re offering. In 
answering the question, let me open the umbrella just a little bit 
wider, first of all, so that we all remember why we have 
assessment, not just in Saskatchewan but in North America. 
 
The fundamental principle in property taxation across North 
America is that it’s based on the ad valorem principle, that is

property is taxed according to its value — okay, property is 
taxed according to its value. So what governments do, again not 
just in Saskatchewan but elsewhere, is that you want to ensure 
that there’s a fair and equitable process of determining what that 
value is. 
 
So SAMA exists to set values, not taxes. Local governments, 
school boards, provincial governments . . . And again we’ve got 
to remember that the provincial government gets no direct 
financial benefit from property tax per se. Whatever is collected 
on this ad valorem principle of property is taxed at its value is 
actually at the local level, whether it’s municipal or 
school-based. So that principle of taxed on its value, fairness 
and equity is critical to ensuring that the pieces fit together. 
 
My role and responsibility is of course to ensure that the agency 
is sustainable, that it’s funded well enough to do the job that it’s 
supposed to do, and that indeed it has the capacity to do the job 
that it’s been given to do. 
 
I meet with the Chair of the board and with the board on 
occasion to discuss matters of what they’re doing, and indeed 
how’s their financing fitting, and indeed are there further 
legislative changes that the board wishes me to make. I also 
attend their annual meeting and I hear the concerns that are 
raised from the various stakeholders. 
 
The member opposite does raise an interesting case. I’m not 
aware of the circumstances. I am as curious as the member is as 
to why this circumstance might exist. And I will use the next 
opportunity that I have with either the Chair of the board or 
with the board as a whole to make some inquiries along this 
line. 
 
But it is the board, indeed, that sets the policy to ensure fair and 
equitable assessments because we do know that local 
governments will use that assessments to collect taxes. And 
that’s a whole other kettle of fish. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Minister, the question of fair and equitable 
assessment in this particular case would be addressed more 
adequately and more properly if there wasn’t that very narrow 
and small piece of land set out as an enhanced neighbourhood. 
If the line of concentric circle around Maple Creek was at 10 
miles and every acreage within that 10 miles was assessed the 
same way, people would understand that. People at 11 miles 
might get a bit of a break. But when you have two, maybe two 
properties within that 3-square mile area immediately south of 
Maple Creek influencing the assessed value, the fair market 
value of every property there, whether it’s realistic or not, it 
creates too much of a burden for the remaining property 
owners. 
 
[15:45] 
 
If that had been spread over the entire group in that 10-mile 
circle, there would have been a lot more equity associated with 
that kind of a finding. And I think that that’s what the local 
property owners are suggesting — that they’re unfairly 
penalized because of the fact that there were one or two 
high-priced sales in this very small area, and it impacted all the 
properties in that small area. 
 

I’d like to move to another topic just briefly. The community of 
Consul, 99 residents, are paying a substantial amount of money 
every year for the work and the attendance of an RCMP officer. 
That detachment, or the sub-detachment, has been unattended, 
has had no officer there for over a year now. There seems to be 
no willingness on the part of anybody to consider rebating them 
some of the money or reducing some of the costs of policing for 
that community. 
 
If you are aware of where Consul is located, it’s in the middle 
of nowhere. And it’s just absolutely essential that it have police 
services there. It’s the only police outpost that can look after the 
border crossing at Willow Creek, and yet they have been 
unrepresented there by the RCMP for over a year but their costs 
have remained static. And I think the community deserves some 
attention to this — either have a policeman posted there or cut 
their costs. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for this question. I 
think the member opposite knows I’ve attended quite a number 
of — in my short period of time as Minister of Government 
Relations — meetings of SARM members and SUMA’s towns 
and villages group. I’ve attended regional meetings. I’ve 
attended the provincial meetings. And of course there’s 
considerable discussion about the costs of providing policing 
services both to small towns and villages and to rural 
municipalities across the province. 
 
I can say that while I remain somewhat sympathetic to the 
circumstances that you are alluding to in terms of the 
community of Consul, I am fully aware that the administration 
of the program to which he refers is completely within the 
jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice. I have been involved in 
the consultation process with communities, and we are fully 
supportive of a funding formula that actually has passed both 
SUMA and SARM conventions with regards to changes in the 
way communities are funded by Justice. Not everyone agrees 
with the new funding formula, but the representative 
organizations understand and recognize that the formula that’s 
currently in place is fairer, or more fair, than the one that was 
previous in place. 
 
But the specific matter that the member raises, I will give notice 
to provide the information to the Minister of Justice. And with 
regards to member’s previous question about assessment, I also 
give notice that I will forward the member’s comments to the 
board of SAMA so that they have the description of the 
circumstances in his words, the community’s words, to respond 
to. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Minister, I appreciate your undertaking. I 
accept it at face value and we will look forward to some 
movement on these particular issues. 
 
I just want to state once more for the record, you know, if a 
community loses one member of a multi-member detachment or 
they have no member but they’re 20 miles away from an active 
detachment, that’s one thing. But the community of Consul is 
probably at least 60 miles from Maple Creek. And it’s the only 
detachment between Maple Creek and the Willow Creek US 
[United States] border crossing. And they really need the 
attention of no less than one police officer, and it’s absolutely 
urgent that they have that as soon as possible. The fact of the 



3166 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

matter is 99 people in a community can’t pay for a policeman 
very long when he or she isn’t there, and they just simply 
cannot afford that. Thank you, Mr. Minister. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member from 
Moosomin. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Minister, and to your 
officials. Mr. Minister, I’m coming back to assessment for a 
moment. 
 
This morning I had the privilege of being able to attend a 
southeast regional SUMA meeting and . . . But also to raise the 
question of this value. A moment ago you talked about property 
assessed according to its value. And ever since the assessment 
notices have been coming out, I’ve been getting calls, whether 
it’s from agriculture producers . . . And as I mentioned at 
SUMA this morning and the comments were made, all SAMA 
has to do is write a cheque. If that’s what my property is valued 
at, write a cheque because there’s nothing in the area that is 
even close to that value. 
 
I would like to know, Mr. Minister, and the question I’ve been 
asked is, how does SAMA arrive at this so-called market value 
that seems to be so much higher than the actual property, or 
sales even, in the area, and the fact that we can’t even get close 
to that value. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Perhaps I could seek a little further 
clarification. Is the member opposite talking about agriculture 
land in particular or something else? 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Chair, Mr. Minister, the calls that I’ve been 
getting at the office have been agricultural land. But today at 
SUMA, some of the comments were actually urban, in smaller 
communities as well. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Well let’s just go back for a second to 
some of the background behind assessment. And again, 
assessment is this ad valorem principle that property is taxed 
according to its value. So we want to ensure that fair value is 
arrived at. The SAMA Board of Directors is charged with 
determining how that is calculated. That’s their job. That’s their 
role. And indeed members of the board have been very 
responsive, particularly on agricultural land, in the recent past. 
 
One of the challenges of the 2005 re-evaluation is that 
agricultural land was previously assessed on the basis of market 
. . . Okay, agricultural land was previously assessed on the basis 
of market index. On the request of rural municipalities and 
SARM, in 2004 SAMA made a change. And that change now 
will see agricultural land assessed on a production basis, which 
is similar to what it was assessed at prior to 1987 . . . 1997. So 
what has taken place is assessed values have in fact shifted as a 
result of this change in approach requested by SARM — a shift 
that has lowered values on agricultural land somewhat on the 
west side of the province and increased them on the east side of 
the province because of the way in which the calculations 
occurred. So there’s a bit of a complication here in terms of that 
assessment. 
 
Secondly, in terms of the way in which we view this, we are 
talking about four-year increments. So 1997 property 

assessments were done bringing about . . . It was about a 
29-year period when we started the assessment process 
seriously. So there was considerable amount of disparity 
between the assessments of 29 years previous and the 
assessment in 1997. 
 
We now have re-evaluation that took place in 2001, which was 
based on 1999 values, and the 2005 re-evaluation is taking into 
account evaluations as of June 2002. These four-year 
increments do indeed recognize what could be substantive 
changes in certain areas that aren’t necessarily recognized 
immediately on the assessment notice. 
 
But at the end of the day, when we are looking at what are we 
doing next, the SAMA board has indicated a desire to move to 
shorten the cycle so that the impact of the changes would in fact 
be less immediate. We’d like to, I’m told, move to a two-year 
from a four-year cycle, and in fact some parts of the country 
have a one-year cycle. I have no idea whether we will have the 
capacity to go to that extent. 
 
So the bottom line is there have been substantive changes, 
particularly on the agriculture side. These are indeed playing 
out with some increased assessments because of the way the 
calculations are done. In terms of smaller towns, every 
circumstance could indeed be different from one community to 
another depending on the circumstances that are not 
immediately recognizable. 
 
But SAMA is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that 
assessments are done on a fair and equitable basis. I have 
confidence that they are doing that. And if there are concerns, 
there are local appeal processes. There’s a provincial appeal 
process. And there’s also the ability of municipalities to bring 
these matters before the annual general meeting of SAMA to 
address the board of directors and the manual itself. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — The Deputy Chair would ask leave to

Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Deputy Chair: — In the west gallery, I’d like to introduce 
34 . . . or to this gallery, to the Chamber, to introduce 34 
students from St. Mark School in Saskatoon. They are in the 
constituency of Saskatoon Riversdale which is the Premier’s 
constituency, but neighbouring right on Saskatoon Fairview 
next to mine. And the students, just to explain to them, we are 
in what is called Committee of the Whole and debating or 
asking questions on Government Relations. 
 
The students are accompanied by their teachers, Mr. James 
Strasky — just wave — Mrs. Robyn Flaman, and Mr. Regan 
Sproule. They also are accompanied by chaperones, Sherri 
Salzsaleur — I hope I pronounced that correctly — Tammy 
Martin, and Sheila Volk. 
 
I’d ask all members to welcome these students to the Assembly. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear!

Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Minister. Just to 
follow up, I think one of the biggest problems we have in 
regards to assessment and addressing the issue is the lack of 
SAMA’s ability to explain how they arrive at their values. 
 
One of the calls I had was from a gentleman who actually went 
to a meeting in his community, and the individual that was there 
couldn’t answer the questions as to exactly how they arrived at 
the value on his property or anybody else’s. And it would seem 
to me, Mr. Minister, there’s got to be someone — or if SAMA’s 
going to be holding meetings — that can really take the time, or 
shouldn’t say take the time, that can simplify the process and 
explain exactly how, and use some references or whatever so 
that people can follow where they’re going when they explain 
exactly how they arrive at these market values. Because as I 
said earlier, the market value right now certainly in our area is 
not reflecting what most people are actually . . . The land that’s 
going up for sale isn’t getting the bids anywhere near that. And 
that kind of annoys people. 
 
So, Mr. Minister, if there’s a way of finding a simple way of 
explaining how the formula is arrived at and how the process is 
moved along so that people can clearly understand what’s being 
said, I think that would certainly alleviate a number of the 
problems out there. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — I think what the member opposite is 
doing is highlighting what I’d indicated earlier. The current 
revaluation, 2005, is based on 2002 values. And this is why on 
pasture land we mitigated some of the concerns in the 2005 
revaluation by changing percentage of value to 40 per cent so 
that there would be some recognition that the value today could 
be considerably different than it was in 2002. 
 

[16:00] 
 
In some of these communities indeed values could have 
declined in ’03, ’04, and now into ’05, but the assessment base 
year is 2002. Now we can’t — this is the problem with the 
four-year cycle — we won’t capture that until the 2009 
revaluation which will take into account June 2007 values. 
 
So government does have some ability with percentages of 
value to address some of these concerns. And we did it on 
pasture land recognizing the impact of BSE [bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy] and the impact that might have had on the 
value of pasture land. 
 
But currently percentages of value have not been changed for a 
number of years. Percentages of value still are 100 per cent for 
commercial, 70 per cent for residential. And so we do have 
some mitigating matters over here but they aren’t related 
specifically to the calculations of assessment. There are some 
concerns out there. 
 
I will again make reference. I will forward the member’s 
comments to the Chair of SAMA which is where they are best 
expressed, at the SAMA board level as to the explanation of the 
way in which calculations are made. If that’s a concern at the 
local level, it is the responsibility of the board and the assessors 
to be able to communicate what it is that they have done. I will 
forward the member’s comments on to the board. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member from Last 
Mountain-Touchwood. 
 
Mr. Hart: — Thank you, Mr. Chair. Minister, I have a 
community in my constituency who is facing a fairly serious 
situation. It’s the community of Lipton. They have one water 
well; they are having problems with it. They have applied under 
the Canada-Saskatchewan infrastructure program for a grant to 
replace the well. 
 
They applied on April 11 . . . or April 8, pardon me. On April 
11 their application was given a project number I’m told, but 
since that time they haven’t heard anything as to where the 
process of their grant is, whether in fact they are eligible for a 
grant. And because of the urgent nature of this situation in 
Lipton — as I said they only have one well; it’s not functioning 
properly — they are keeping their fingers crossed that they can 
get funding together in time to replace that well before it 
discontinues producing any water. I wonder if you could 
provide that community with some sort of an idea as to when 
they will be . . . hear some results of their grant application. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much for the question, 
not just in terms of this particular application that the member 
asks about but perhaps to all communities that have applications 
under the program. 
 
I can indicate to the member opposite that of course first of all 
those applications are not made to the minister. They’re made to 
the program. There is a project review committee that’s in place 
that receives those applications. There are indeed 
representatives of the urban and rural municipalities that sit on 
the project review committee. 
 



3168 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

I can indicate to the member opposite and to all the 
communities concerned that the committee is currently, I’ve 
been told, is currently reviewing the applications that have been 
received. They are very close to having completed the review of 
all of the applications that have been made. I am informed that 
the committee will be in a position to respond in some way to 
the communities by mid-June. But it will depend entirely on 
number of applications received, how much dollar value is 
available, how all of the applications meet the various criteria, 
how the committee reviews all of those factors coming in 
together, how quickly after mid-June we’ll be able to have 
formal announcements. 
 
But I think I could indicate that should the community in 
question wish to know how they’ve stacked up against the 
criteria and whether they’re still in the running, that sort of 
thing, probably a call to the program office sometime mid- to 
late-June would provide them with some direction.

The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member from Melfort. 
 
Mr. Gantefoer: — Thank you, Mr. Chair, and Minister, and 
welcome to officials this afternoon. Minister, I want to briefly 
follow up on a matter that we hadn’t touched on in our previous 
discussions. I provided you with a copy of a letter that was 
addressed to you so that you’d have it referenced. 
 
The essence of this letter is from a lady — and I don’t want to 
disclose the person’s name in fairness and respect to the privacy 
— but this lady has an autistic child who has required some 
specialized educational programming. And she writes that she 
felt that her child actually has had a great success with learning 
in a home-based environment to the point that he is now 
academically a year ahead of students of his own age, age 15 
and doing grade 11 work. 
 
However with his autism he has some issues in regard to other 
speech impediments, specifically stuttering. And she is 
concerned that as he approaches the age where he can acquire 
university education that this might be a very significant 
deterrent to his ability to succeed at the university level. 
 
Her concern is, is that there are some programs — although that 
they are patchworked on the public school level — that when he 
approaches older years, that these programs may not be 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3169 

available to him. And with a significant amount of his education 
coming from a home-based environment she is concerned about 
this issue. 
 
This issue as well has raised a concern in a general sense about 
the lack of uniformity and real clear direction in terms of how 
these programs are going to be provided for people that have 
special needs from the School Boards Association, who are 
concerned in section 18 of Bill 114 that there is a change in 
definition of what the services are. And they’re looking, I think 
as the parent of the child is looking, for the minister to sort of 
lay out a pretty clear direction about what the roles and 
responsibilities of the department, of the school system, and of 
the community are. And I would like you to provide that 
statement, Mr. Minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Well thank you very much. This is a 
. . . This is both a complex issue and obviously an important 
one. 
 
We are not contemplating under the changes to legislation that 
have been introduced any significant change in role on how we 
deal with special needs programming. We still believe very 
much that while we should have some provincial direction, 
while boards should be encouraged to have those programs in 
place, that they are going to need to work on a board-by-board 
basis to make sure they’ve got the best services in place to deal 
with the students within their system. 
 
The legislation the member has referenced largely deals with 
how we can deal with some of the better, more seamless 
approach to integration and programming. And I think that 
that’s something we welcome. But I have to admit we are 
treading lightly on this until we have some better 
understandings to where the school boards are wanting to go 
with it. 
 
The system up to now has worked relatively well as the parents 
have a good relationship for the most part with the individual 
schools and with their boards. We want to make sure not to be 
too disruptive in doing that at the same time that we look at 
making sure we’ve got provincial access. 
 
I think one of the key pieces here, and one of the key 
opportunities we have as we look to the larger school divisions 
and their relative uniformity and border configuration in 
comparison to the health districts, is the ability to work together 
with the health divisions in terms of service provision. This is 
one of the issues that we’re looking at. 
 
With specific reference to the case that the member has 
identified, I’m reluctant to comment in much detail on the floor 
about it, except to say that this is very much a dispute between 
the individual parent in this case and the school board as to 
what may be needed. I’m still encouraged that the board, and 
the parent may be able to work out a solution, and I’m hopeful 
that will be the case. But as I understand that process is still 
working itself through. 
 
[16:15] 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member for 
Lloydminster. 

Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Deputy Chair. Mr. Minister, 
welcome to your officials. I just have a quick question, Mr. 
Minister, mainly for clarification. It’s with regards to sending a 
student to a private school, at Wilcox Notre Dame as an 
example. Hypothetically I’m a resident of Lloydminster, and I 
have a son that wants to go to Notre Dame. It’s not hypothetical 
that I live in Lloyd, but it’s hypothetical that I have a son who 
wants to go there. But nonetheless my understanding is that I 
can transfer my son from the Saskatchewan school system in 
Lloydminster into the Wilcox environment. Would that be 
correct? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — As I understand, the relationship with 
Notre Dame is that they are a historical high school. There’s no 
difficulty with undertaking the transfer from the Lloydminster 
division to Notre Dame. The funding that we provide to Notre 
Dame is the basic rate funding that we provide for, as I 
understand, all historical high schools. That’s part of the 
funding regime that we have in place. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Now I want to 
add just a little bit of a mix to this. There’s a person in 
Lloydminster that wants to send her son to Notre Dame. She 
lives in Lloydminster as well. She pays Saskatchewan tax 
because everything in Lloydminster city, as you know, is 
administered under the Saskatchewan education Act. However 
her address is Alberta, Lloydminster. She is paying 
Saskatchewan tax and has been and continues to. I don’t see a 
great deal of difference because we’re living in the same city. 
That’s where I need a clarification from you, Mr. Minister. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Can I just get clarification on that? 
This particular individual is on the Alberta side of the border. 
 
Mr. Wakefield: — Yes, Mr. Minister. The parent of this 
student, the son going to school in Lloydminster, is actually 
living on the Alberta side. However everybody on the 
Lloydminster side — the Alberta side of Lloydminster, sorry — 
everybody on the Alberta side, as Saskatchewan side, pays into 
the same tax system for the school system. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Well this is a complicated issue 
unfortunately. As the member will know, the border does cause 
some issues on this. As I understand, the practice is that 
residents on the Alberta side would not have that same 
opportunity. Certainly could send the student to Wilcox, but 
there would not be the provincial funding provided to it. Alberta 
would need to do that. 
 
This year I should also identify that Lloydminster has switched 
over to the Alberta assessment system, and so that is a bit of a 
change also. If the member wants, I can certainly take down the 
information afterwards. And we can correspond with the parent 
just to make sure that she understands the, I guess, the rationale 
for that and what the process would be for her to approach the 
Alberta government in terms of them providing some funding. 
Otherwise I assume it’s a normal tuition arrangement they 
would have in place. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member from Saskatoon 
Silver Springs.

Minister, and your officials for being here this afternoon. Like 
to ask a few questions about a subject that’s very important to 
me and very important to residents of northeast Saskatoon, and 
that’s the proposal for an elementary school in Arbor Creek. 
 
Every day in the legislature here, or almost every day, I’ve had 
the opportunity to present petitions on behalf of families and 
indeed on behalf of children in northeast Saskatoon about the 
need for an elementary school. I think the minister will be 
aware of those petitions, and I’m sure that he takes them very 
seriously when they are brought up in the House. 
 
The minister will be aware of the presentation that was put 
together by the Arbor Creek School Initiative Group. It’s a 
presentation that was done entirely by volunteers and was done 
very well. Fifty families from Arbor Creek took it upon 
themselves to survey the entire area, to survey every house and 
find out the exact number of children by specific age in the 
area. And the numbers are quite staggering, Mr. Chair. Under 
the age of five years old in Arbor Creek alone, 567 students 
presently, and that’s great because it’s a growing area. There’s 
young people who have decided to stay here, to make their 
careers, to have a family and to indeed share in the joy of living 
in Saskatchewan. 
 
I know that the minister is familiar with this presentation that 
was put together, and certainly his officials will be. I would like 
to see if the minister or his officials would they concur with the 
results that have been shown by the study. 
 
You know, another thing that it talks about is approximately 
120 students will be entering kindergarten this year, entering 
kindergarten in the existing schools: Cardinal Leger, College 
Park, Dr. John G. Egnatoff, and Father Robinson, schools for 
the most part who are very large. Certainly Dr. John G. 
Egnatoff Elementary School and Father Robinson have 
enrolments of over 600 students each, two of the largest 
elementary schools in the province. 
 
So, Mr. Minister, if I could begin by asking you your comments 
on the presentation by the Arbor Creek School Initiative Group 
and if indeed, if the facts presented, if you see fit to challenge 
them in any way. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciated very much the correspondence that I have received 
from parents in the Arbor Creek area. Certainly it is a positive 
sign as we see our communities growing and prospering. And 
with that, the growth of our neighbourhoods, obviously we need 
to look at bringing in new services. 
 
Currently we are undergoing a reassessment of these enrolment 
numbers and the potential enrolment numbers that we’re 
looking at. We should know, hopefully by middle of June, end 
of June, end of June as to how that matches up with the survey 
that the parents have done. 
 
Once that is complete, then we will need to take a look at how 
this compares with other projects across the province in terms 
of the priority. I would anticipate, given the discussions we’ve 
had with the Saskatoon board and our own internal discussions, 
that this will likely be a higher priority than it has been in past 
years, given the information we have in front of us. The 

difficulty is sorting that out across all the other capital projects 
in the province. But I do anticipate that Arbor Creek will move 
up on the priority list. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I just wanted 
to comment on a meeting that took place on March 9 in 
northeast Saskatoon at the Alice Turner Library. There was 
approximately 150 to 170 local residents there. Invitations went 
out to the minister, to myself, to local representatives from 
across the city and across the different levels of the Department 
of Learning. 
 
Myself, Ken Muggeridge from the YMCA [Young Men’s 
Christian Association] was able to make a presentation; Don 
Armstrong; George Rathwell, the superintendent of the public 
school board; John McAuliffe, the superintendent of the 
Catholic school board; as well as local representatives, Lisa 
Lambert and Ron Boechler. Ray Morrison from the . . . trustee 
with the public school board was there as well. And, Mr. 
Minister, to your credit and the department’s credit, Mr. Nelson 
Wagner, Sask Learning department facilities branch, executive 
director; and Crandall Hrynkiw, Sask Learning department 
regional director. 
 
I just want to say how pleased I was that invitations went out to 
all players, everyone concerned. And it’s unfortunate you 
weren’t able to be there yourself, but certainly you were well 
represented by your officials. And I think it was a really good 
meeting — I think the officials will agree — having all players 
in the room. And I think the meeting went on for two and a half 
or three hours, where everyone in the room was able to ask 
every question that had come to mind. 
 
I guess my question now, Mr. Minister, is what has happened 
since the March 9 meeting? Have there been discussions 
between your officials and Saskatoon public schools and 
Saskatoon Catholic schools? And if indeed there has been, 
which I suspect there was, what information can you share with 
the House at this time? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Mr. Chairman, I should have 
introduced that Nelson Wagner has joined me on the floor of 
the Assembly. He is of course the executive director of the 
facilities branch of the department. 
 
I appreciate the member’s comments about the meeting. I felt it 
was important that the appropriate department officials went to 
the meeting, so they could explain the process. I think that often 
citizens are of the view that these decisions are made politically 
by the cabinet or by the minister, in terms of which schools get 
funded and which don’t. Indeed we have a long-standing 
tradition in this province, going back many administrations, in 
terms of a priority-setting exercise. It takes a look at pressures 
within the enrolment numbers, potential enrolment numbers, 
looks at funding arrangements, certainly relies a lot on the 
priority that the individual boards place on these projects. 
 
As a result of the discussions that have been ongoing and the 
information gathering that’s gone on since March as I’d 
indicated, I believe it will be by the end of June in a better 
position to assess what priority ranking a new Arbor Creek 
facility would have within the Saskatoon configuration. We’ll 
need to still balance that out across other provincial priorities: is 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3171 

there many other schools that are competing for capital dollars? 
But I do think that the process embarked upon by the 
neighbourhood association has been helpful in terms of helping 
to identify the potential need for a school in the area. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I think it’s fair 
to say that the 2005-2009 major capital list that comes out from 
your department, people in Arbor Creek are waiting with bated 
breath to see what that report contains. Now you’re saying that 
you will have updated numbers sometime in June. Will you 
have those numbers in time to incorporate them into the 
rankings of this list? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — That is our intention, yes. 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. And I think 
you’re aware and your officials are aware that Saskatoon public 
schools and Saskatoon Catholic schools have made this their 
number one priority as far as new capital funding. Certainly in 
the priority ranking that the public division does — the B-5 if 
you like — they’ve made that the number one priority. So I 
hope you would take than into consideration. 
 
Also the group and the school divisions have been very open to 
looking at new concepts, any type of innovative ideas — K to 5 
[kindergarten to grade 5] schools, K to 3 schools, middle 
school, however it fits in. The group has been very open. And 
they’re just looking for any direction or any help from your 
department or your officials that can help strengthen their bid or 
their argument, if you like. And I hope that the minister and his 
officials will take the time to continue communicating with the 
Arbor Creek group. 
 
And I just want to take a minute — and I’m sure the minister 
and his officials will indulge with me — to recognize the 
committee members from the Arbor Creek School Initiative 
Group: Ajay Chevi, James Hatley, Sarah Horseman, Richard 
and Rhonda Leakos, Ronalee Pawluk, Sheri Ritchie, Callie 
Tratch, Bob Wickenberg, Lyle Wiebe, Lori Wiebe, and other 
supportive families from across northeast Saskatoon. 
 
I think the minister realizes their sincere desire to see the best 
education possible for their children, and they would see that 
through the establishment of a new school. And I agree with 
him that growing areas are the vibrancy of our province. I 
happen to represent an area that’s unlike many other areas in 
Saskatchewan that is growing. And I would just like the 
minister’s comment, final comments on this issue. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Well certainly I want to also say that 
the work and the presentations that have been pulled together 
by the parents’ group have been welcome, and they have been 
certainly well done and are appreciated by our officials. It’s 
helpful as we then work through with the school divisions, their 
priority list. 
 
I think we need to also put this into context in terms of the 
situation that the Saskatoon boards find themselves in. As the 
member will know, we are embarking right now on two very 
significant capital projects within the city of Saskatoon. I’ll be 
turning sod this week on the new Centennial Collegiate, which 
is an exciting project in Saskatoon, and we are moving forward 
also with the Tommy Douglas high school project on the west 

side. These are both significant capital projects which involve 
millions of dollars and of course are putting some pressure on 
the boards as well as the provincial treasury to make sure that 
we’re able to fund that. This is an issue as we take a look at 
how we sequence out projects. And so I want to make sure that 
we understand the part of what we do in the province. 
 
[16:30] 
 
And indeed this has nothing to do with me being a New 
Democrat, the member opposite being Sask Party. Frankly the 
system will work the same regardless of who’s in the 
administration. This process that serves Liberal, New 
Democrat, and Conservative administrations for decades is a 
process which is depoliticized and I think should remain such. 
 
But the issues that we’re trying to deal with right now are the 
ability for the boards to be able to finance the projects. 
Certainly part of the discussion we’re having around Arbor 
Creek with the public board is the question about what the 
scope of the school should be. I think that the work that the 
public board is doing around this idea of new K to 5 facilities 
tied in with other community development really is a very 
encouraging one and may be a much more flexible model to 
look at than the traditional K to 8. 
 
It may in fact deal with us being able to take pressure off of 
some of these grades where we want to make sure schools are 
closer to the kids, but at the same time not have to overbuild 
infrastructure. We can continue to renew existing infrastructure 
and deal with a more integrated and appropriate usage of 
existing facilities. 
 
That’s the discussion we’re into with the public board. We’re 
certainly going to take a look at what the information comes 
back with this. I have indicated — and the officials have 
advised me — we expect that Arbor Creek probably will move 
up on the priority list. How quickly that then moves into a 
funding cycle is yet to be determined. 
 
We have a large backlog in terms of maintenance issues within 
existing schools. We spend a great deal on that. That’s a 
particular pressure in rural areas. And we are wanting to make 
sure that we don’t neglect those at the same time we’re building 
new schools in cities like Saskatoon. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member from Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Minister, 
welcome to you and your officials. I’d like to switch gears a 
little bit now and move to the post-secondary education part of 
your portfolio and talk about one of the initiatives that was 
announced in this spring’s budget. Frankly I thought it was one 
of the more significant and exciting elements of the budget. 
And I would like to congratulate the minister for undertaking 
this. 
 
You talked about a student loan program review. And I would 
like if you would take the time, Mr. Minister, to describe for us 
sort of the parameters of this review, what you anticipate what 
the terms of reference are, what you hope to achieve with this 
particular review. 



3172 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

Hon. Mr. Thomson: — I want to thank the member for his 
comments and his support for this initiative. I have to say this is 
an initiative that is very important to me personally. Some 15 
years ago when I was a student union president, this was 
exactly what I was pushing for. At that point lobbying, I think 
the minister was Ray Meiklejohn at the time, consistently that 
we needed to have a fundamental review of the way student aid 
worked. 
 
I was reminded of that commitment I had made as a student 
union president some months ago when I was touring the 
student union offices in Saskatoon and the current president, 
Gavin Gardner, pulled me aside and handed me a nice 
newspaper clipping with a much younger and certainly a much 
more blow-dried version of me standing there saying that I 
thought we should have a student loan review. 
 
It did make sense then. I think it makes more sense now. To put 
it into context, we spend about $100 million a year on student 
financial assistance. About 30 million of that is forgivable. 
 
Now over the last number of years, we have made a number of 
changes to the programs. We brought back in bursaries and 
forgivable loans. We introduced a number of new programs like 
centennial merit scholarships. We have continued to work with 
the federal government to try and deal with some of the 
pressures that are in the existing program. 
 
At one point, we had decentralized the administration payment 
out to the Royal Bank. We’ve now repatriated that. We’ve tried 
a number of different things. 
 
What I had said to the student leaders as we got into this 
discussion about what a potential student loan review would 
look like is, let’s take all of the money that we spend on student 
financial assistance — us, the universities, other agencies — 
let’s take that and see whether or not the system can be 
streamlined, whether we can coordinate it, whether it meets our 
needs, and whether we can redesign it. And if in redesigning it, 
can we engage the federal government into that process. 
 
Right now what we are working through are the terms of 
reference with the two student leaders, one of whom is new 
here at the U of R [University of Regina], Victor Thomas, who 
has just been elected as the president. And we are working with 
the university presidents to try and sort out how we might 
structure. 
 
My hope is that we would have the review complete in time for 
us to incorporate it into next year’s budget cycle. I don’t 
anticipate this is going to take us a long time. It will probably 
take us another month or two months to get up and running. But 
I would hope that over the course of the fall we’ll be able to 
actually pull together a workable plan and decide what changes 
we need to make and how we should move forward. 
 
So I apologize for being somewhat long-winded, but I wanted 
to put the decision and the issue into some context. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Well, Mr. Minister, I of all people don’t object 
to long-winded answers because I anticipate my questions will 
be equally so. The student loan review that you’ve undertaken 
is going to be important for a lot of reasons. And having been 

PSE [post-secondary education] critic before and now just 
reassuming it recently, I think that of all the issues that have 
been brought to my attention the accessibility of students to 
student loan financing has been one of the strongest irritants, 
one of the greatest areas of concern for students. 
 
And I would welcome, you know, a thorough look at how that 
money that is being spent for student assistance now might 
provide maybe not greater ease, but certainly greater access. 
One of the issues that has provoked the most concern among 
constituents certainly is access for young people that come from 
farm families because of large amounts of, you know, capital in 
the farming operation but very little cash flow. And because of 
the way the rules are set out, it’s very difficult for young people 
from a farm environment to access student funding to a level 
that would be readily accessed possibly by young people from a 
different set of personal circumstances. So I hope that the 
review will take that particular anomaly into consideration. 
 
Mr. Minister, when you talked about setting the whole thing 
into motion in the next few weeks or months, can you indicate 
for us who will be involved? You’ve talked about the two 
student union presidents from the respective universities in the 
province, but are there going to be additional professional 
individuals involved with this? Do you expect an internal 
review, some external participation with this review? Could you 
elaborate on that. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Let me start with the last set of 
questions first that pertain to the review. The review will be an 
internal review. I’m not looking at appointing an outside expert 
to come in and do it as Ontario did with Bob Rae and the 
planning commission. I think what we need at this point is more 
of an action committee, a task force internally to try and figure 
out what is workable, how do we move it forward. 
 
We’ll be working with the student unions at the two 
universities. We’ll be working with the student association at 
SIAST [Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and 
Technology]. We’ll be working with the administrations of each 
of those organizations, each of those institutions — SIAST, the 
University of Regina, the University of Saskatchewan — to pull 
that together. There is also the student scholarship, bursary, and 
loans committee that we’ll be consulting. There’ll be a number 
of people that we’ll be working with to do this. 
 
Our interest is really in identifying what those key irritants are. 
What are the quick wins that we can do to fix the system to deal 
with those irritants, and then what are the systemic changes we 
need to make? One of the biggest challenges we have on the 
systemic side is our participation in the Canada student loan 
program and our need to make sure that we stay in line with 
that. 
 
The member has identified in the earlier part of his question a 
set of issues around accessibility, and certainly I’ve heard 
concern also from students in rural areas about access. Now 
there is a misconception that we take into account the asset base 
for farm families into that mix. We in fact don’t. We take a look 
at, as I understand, simply the income earned off of that land. 
 
Now there are assumptions made about what that is, and I think 
what we end up with is people believe that they can’t apply 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3173 

because there’s too much money in, and one of the difficulties 
we certainly have within the farm sector is the fluctuation in 
income. Some years are good years. Some years are not good 
years, and that will affect the amount of parental contribution 
that’s expected for dependent children and dependent students. 
That is an issue. 
 
I would say on the larger issue of accessibility, the biggest 
challenge that we have is everyone’s defining it differently. In 
some cases it is a question of how do people get access to the 
appropriate amount of money it costs to go to university. In 
other cases it’s, how do we make sure that we’re doing that in a 
way that’s forgivable and that the debt loads are managed? In 
another case it may be, how do we make sure we’ve got special 
targeted assistance for under-represented groups? 
 
Accessibility is getting defined in a lot of different ways by a 
lot of different groups. Part of what I’m hoping that we’ll be 
able to get through this discussion is a better understanding 
within that academic community as to what the accessibility 
challenge really is. 
 
I am regularly asked as to what we’re going to do to get more 
First Nations and Métis students in, and this is a very good 
question. We know in our labour market review, we need to do 
more of that. But the universities are actually doing a fairly 
decent job. We have more students from under-represented 
groups now in our institutions than at any point before. We 
have more students in our post-secondary institutions than at 
any time before. We have more women attending than at any 
time before. 
 
The institutions are for the most part doing a good job of 
involving, sorry, I should say, evolving to deal with these 
different pressures we have within our society, but there are still 
some real challenges about how we structure the student 
financial assistance to deal with it. 
 
Anyway, I could go on for some time. And I’m sure that as we 
get the report back that we can discuss it in more detail. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. The issue of 
accessibility as you pointed out is, you know, a different issue 
for different people under different circumstances. I’m 
wondering if one of the ways of approaching that might not be 
to make the money from a student financial program contingent 
on the certain program or the specific program that a student is 
participating in that would be . . . you know that would allow a 
student to draw down as needed, when needed, for that specific 
program. 
 
I’ve got some ideas around that and I don’t want to take the 
time to outline that whole program here, but every individual’s 
needs could be met if the money associated with the financial 
help was directly related to the type of program and the expense 
of the program that that individual had selected. 
 
You also, Mr. Minister, had talked about a study of a different 
sort — a program of a different sort or an undertaking to look at 
the role that our technical institutes and our regional colleges as 
well as the apprenticeship program would contribute to the 
economy. 
 

And again I think we agree with the government that these 
kinds of initiatives, these kinds of undertakings are important to 
keep our supply of skilled labour up to standards, up to the 
requirements of the growing economy and the needs in this 
province. But I’m wondering if you’ve given some thought to 
what it is you really want to see this study achieve. I don’t think 
that you would undertake — if I can make this assumption — I 
don’t think you’d undertake a study of this type if you didn’t 
have some objectives or goals that you would hope to see 
derived from this undertaking. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Mr. Chairman, I want to identify that 
I’ve been joined directly behind me by Brady Salloum, who is 
the executive director of student financial assistance. 
 
With respect to the question of the training review there are 
some objectives that we have identified, not the least of which 
is how we develop a more seamless system. We need to really 
think about how it is we get a closer relationship between the 
educational institutions and the needs of Saskatchewan’s 
economy. 
 
The system today is largely driven by student demand and that 
is not always reflective of what the economy needs. It ends up 
with us having in some cases, where we have economic-driven 
or job-driven programs, long waiting lists. For example where 
we have oversupply we may end up with a long waiting list on 
medical lab technologists, is a good example of that. Other 
areas we have critical shortages like industrial welders. 
 
We’ve got to get a better relationship within the regional 
colleges, SIAST system and I would argue the K to 12 system 
so that we can start to doing better work on career planning to 
get people lined up for that kind of jobs. 
 
The second issue that we need to try and deal with is one how 
we . . . simply how do we meet the growing needs of our 
provincial economy. We’re in a fortunate position today that the 
economy’s outpacing our ability to supply it with labour. We’ve 
got to figure out how it is we get more people into the right 
industries quickly, and that’s part of what the training review is. 
 
[16:45] 
 
Beyond that I have not really set out any kind of expectation as 
to what that review’s going to come back with. I have suggested 
it should focus less on governance structure and more on 
operational initiatives and operational approaches to fixing this. 
I’m not interested in getting into a big governance review at this 
point although I understand both regional colleges and SIAST 
have some interest in us looking at their Acts, and we may do 
that. But the study for the most part is largely open to what the 
participants bring forward for ideas. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Minister, with apologies to my colleague, 
the critic for K to 12, I want to also bring in the possibility of 
the composite high schools that offer trades training. As part of 
this review process have you decided against including them as 
part of this consideration, or do you anticipate having that as 
part of the full review? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — There is a consultation that’ll be 
undertaken with them, and there’s some very interesting things 



3174 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

going on within the K to 12 system, within the comprehensive 
school system, but also in the high schools within many of the 
communities. 
 
We have got to, I believe, work first on getting a better 
understanding on how we’re going to tackle the training, and 
what our training needs are. Doug Elliott’s work’s been very 
helpful to us in identifying some of that. We now need to figure 
out how to operationalize that so we don’t trip over ourselves, 
between regional colleges and the role they can play, and 
SIAST, and the Apprenticeship and Trade Certification 
Commission. We are going to take that work and work it back 
then into the K to 12 system and figure out how do we 
encourage more young people to look at the trades. How do we 
deal with that? What is it we need to do in terms of our 
discussion with the trades themselves, in terms of making that a 
more welcoming approach to going into apprenticeship? 
 
So there are a number of pieces that I expect will flow out of it. 
This potentially is one of the most important pieces of 
economic development work that the government will 
undertake beyond the tax and business reviews. This is a 
fundamental piece for us to make sure we’ve got high skilled, 
high . . . well-qualified labour available to meet the needs of 
employers. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. As a result of the 
announcement made by yourself, and the newspaper articles 
that came out of that announcement a couple of weeks ago, I 
got a call to my office from a gentleman who’d been an 
instructor at the high school level in the, I believe, Swift 
Current composite high school. And he indicated to me that, 
you know, a significant study was undertaken quite some time 
ago. It was probably 25 years or more ago now, maybe 30, and 
. . . well it might even be more than that now that I’m thinking 
back. But nevertheless his concern is that if we don’t start 
addressing the potential for trades training in the high school, 
we risk the possibility of losing the interest of many young 
people who might really see that as their opportunity and their 
future. 
 
I recall in my own family my son, who was at loose ends as to 
what he wanted to do, spent a number of months working with a 
local plumber over the summertime. And he was really quite 
taken by the opportunities that that trade presented for him, 
especially in a small rural community where the trades are 
undersupplied as it is and the opportunity to, you know, start 
and finish a job and contribute to somebody’s improved 
accommodations, or whatever the problem was, appealed to 
him. He ended up being a photographer, but nevertheless that 
experience, I think, said pretty clearly to me that young people 
at that 15, 16, 17 age arena might really benefit from an 
encouragement, an inducement, to trades if they are given that 
opportunity at the high school level. 
 
So the call I got from this gentleman that I referred to earlier, 
his frustration was that there was a big initiative to move in that 
direction many years ago but, as time passed, there seemed to 
be less and less emphasis on that — more on academic training. 
And we had well-equipped shops and facilities sitting there 
underutilized, in some cases mothballed. So I guess if there is 
an opportunity to revitalize some of that equipment that’s there 
even now, some of those facilities, and encourage young people 

at that high school age to get involved in the trades training 
area, it might go a long way to solving some of the manpower 
shortages we’re discussing here. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — In large part I agree what the member 
has outlined is both the problem and the opportunity that we 
have. Last year we completed a review and a reform of the 
practical and applied arts curriculum for the K to 12 system. We 
believe that that was important as a first step to really bringing 
back up to, well let’s say bringing into focus the issue of trades 
education. This was important for us to renew that, to put the 
priority back on that. 
 
I agree that really, in the mid-’80s, things started to drift away 
from the idea that trades and apprenticeship were the focus of 
the K to 12 system. I think it was done for the most part in a 
well-meaning way. It was just a renewed focus on academics. 
What we now believe though is that we are needing to get back 
into that, that young people want that relevant experience earlier 
on. They want exposure to real-life experiences and real-life 
occupations. 
 
I have long been frustrated by the lack of understanding that 
young people have about job opportunities in local 
communities. When I look at the growth and the potential for 
growth that we have in our rural and northern communities, it is 
largely fuelled through trades education. It will be fuelled by 
the trades, by blue-collar work. And I think part of it is, I mean 
if you had a better definition — blue collar has a certain 
connotation of being low-skilled, low-quality, but in fact it is 
not that in today’s economy. 
 
We have got to figure out how we get young people 
reinvigorated and re-interested in that. We’ve got to figure out 
how we connect them back with real opportunities in our 
communities and how it is the school system ties into that. 
 
Frankly I think regional colleges have a huge potential to do 
that. They’ve got a good network. They’ve got a good 
coordinating group with employer counsel. SIAST does also. 
We’ve got a real opportunity to build on this back into the K to 
12 system. The training review needs to be part of that. We 
need to continue to work within the K to 12 system on that. 
There are a number of different initiatives that we’re launching 
to do it. 
 
Our big challenge right now is scalability. How quickly can we 
get there? How do we do it in a way that works best and meets 
the needs of those students? And I would argue that this is 
important for us in a number of ways. It will be important for us 
as we deal with literacy to make sure workplace literacy is 
there. It will be important for us to deal with local employers to 
make sure capacity is there — that as we get people trained up, 
then they’ve got that opportunity to deal with it. 
 
It will be important for us to also deal with students — and 
particularly male students who are not seeing the same 
completion rates as female students — to convince them that 
they need to complete that grade 12 to go on to post-secondary 
training to get the trades to get the job. 
 
This is a big agenda, but it is an absolutely fundamental one if 
we’re going to be able to continue to feed the economic growth 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3175 

of our province. And that’s what we’re going to continue to 
work on. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — I know this is going to sound, you know, a bit 
. . . Well it’s intended to be facetious, but one of the best 
motivators to get young people involved in the trades was 
represented by a situation in my home community. Our plumber 
was the first guy in town to have a big screen TV, and 
everybody knew he made too much money, or maybe lots of 
money. And they took to that opportunity pretty well. 
 
And, you know, I think that we’ve just, we’ve just 
underestimated and under-advised young people about the 
opportunities in the trades, and especially in small town 
Saskatchewan. 
 
You know in the community of Eastend, we didn’t have an 
electrician there for a number of years. The closest electrician 
drove 35 miles to attend to work in our local community. We do 
have the good fortune of two plumbers. We have a couple of 
carpenters and contractors. But, you know, if you need some 
small electrical job done, it’s hard to find somebody in a timely 
fashion. And when they do come, they’ve driven a long ways 
and the cost is substantially higher. 
 
So anything we can do to encourage young people to take up 
the trades and practise it in their own local community is 
something that would be greeted with a, you know, a 
considerable appreciation by people who have a tough time 
finding tradespeople, qualified tradespeople at home. 
 
You alluded to the fact that you had your specialist on student 
loans, and I want to go back just briefly. There was a question I 
wanted to ask about student financing and student programs and 
the cost of default as far as student loans are concerned. 
 
According to the Bob Rae review in Ontario, they were 
experiencing apparently a 7 per cent default rate for universities 
and a 16 per cent default rate for colleges. Do we have similar 
figures in Saskatchewan? And if not, what are they? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — The numbers are in fact similar, as I 
understand, to Ontario. 
 
I want to just return to the issue that the member has raised 
about tradespeople within local communities. One of the 
biggest things that we need to change if we are going to combat 
the negative stereotypes around the trades and the issue that it 
then feeds into — youth out-migration — isn’t a change that 
has to happen in the school system. It has to happen at the 
kitchen table. We have got to change that attitude. And it’s 
something ingrained in Saskatchewan people. You know it 
doesn’t matter what generation it is, everyone decided their kids 
were going to do better than them, whatever that hierarchy 
meant. And for that most part that often meant, you know, they 
were going to go to the university. 
 
And indeed in this Assembly, we still often have members who 
stand up and say, I was the first member of my family to ever 
go to a university. That is a remarkable accomplishment and 
something we should always celebrate. But that should not be 
tied in to the social status of the community or necessarily in to 
the value of the individual. And we really do need to think 

about how it is we priorize that. 
 
I agree. It’s just as important for us to have well-trained people 
in the pure sciences as it is to have well-trained electricians. 
And within our economy and our local economies, often it’s 
more so important to have the tradespeople in terms of fuelling 
the economic growth and the social development of our 
communities, maintaining that tax base. We’ve got to do more 
on that, but a lot of that has got to deal with changing our 
attitude as a people. And we have just got to figure out how it is 
that we incorporate that. 
 
I notice SIAST has launched a new set of ads to in fact promote 
the point that you make . . . that the member makes, that the 
trades are in fact very well paid. I was impressed to see . . . The 
other night I was watching — I have no idea what is was — 
some television. I think it was CSI was on. And the federal 
government was sponsoring advertisements about bringing 
people into the trades. This is all part of what we need to do to 
change the perception. 
 
The other piece that we’ve got to figure out is how we work on 
developing more positive attitudes within young people about 
the future of rural Saskatchewan. 
 
I was recently in Humboldt and was talking to a group of high 
school students, asking them — there must have been about 60 
of them — and I asked how many were going to go on to 
post-secondary education. About, probably about 40 of them 
put up their hands saying that they were going to. With the 
exception of four, they were all going to university. Now in 
Humboldt you can get your first two years of university, at 
Humboldt. Not a single student in that room said that they were 
prepared to stay in Humboldt to do their post-secondary 
education. 
 
We really have to think about what that says about what we’re 
telling our kids about life in our rural communities and how it is 
we encourage them to stay and come back after they’ve got that 
education, because even when we’re providing the education in 
the communities or within the regions, they’re not necessarily 
wanting to stay to do it. And we’ve got to really drive into that 
and figure out what is causing that because that ties into the 
problems we run into with student loans. Obviously if you can 
stay and do your education in a local community it’s much 
cheaper that needing to go and move into the big city. 
 
Now there’s a lot of things we all know, being young at one 
point, that drive that — wanting to move away from the parents, 
wanting to meet new people, looking for a spouse; whatever it 
is that, you know, that drives young people. We’ve got to really 
understand how that changes things. 
 
But there are a lot of problems that we have got to try and 
address and a lot of them really do go back to that fundamental, 
you’re going to do better than me, you’re going to do something 
different than me, you’re going to move and go to the 
universities. 
 
The problem is it becomes not that much of a jump to go from 
Eastend to Swift Current, Swift Current to Saskatoon, 
Saskatoon to Calgary. And we’ve got to figure out earlier into 
that process how it is we arrest that. Or worse yet, Eastend to 



3176 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

Medicine Hat, U of C [University of Calgary], and then you’re 
already there. So that’s the piece that we’ve got to work on and 
I think the member would know this, obviously would have his 
own recollections of this from his own communities. But I think 
that that’s a real challenge for us. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Mr. Minister, I think you’ve articulated really 
what my concerns have been in this area for the last number of 
years. And I’ve said this, I’ll repeat it again. Some of your 
officials will have heard me say this previously. But what really 
troubles me the most is when young people come out of high 
school in southwest Saskatchewan, a large number of them and 
I would dare say the majority of them, don’t even consider 
post-secondary education of any kind in Saskatchewan. I mean, 
Medicine Hat College and University of Lethbridge are just like 
big magnets and they go there without reservation and without 
hesitation and we don’t get them back. 
 
I just want to go back to the importance of introducing high 
school students to the trades early in life. You know, the 
opportunities that we have with those young people exercised at 
an earlier period in life is going to give them an opportunity to 
make that choice sooner. What I think happens — and maybe 
this is just my experience anecdotally — but I think what 
happens, you get students coming to grade 12 and graduating, 
and they don’t know for sure what they want to do. Well that’s 
when they default to a university program, or they might go to 
SIAST. 
 
[17:00] 
 
But very few of them will default to an apprenticeship program. 
You know, very few of them will go to the local John Deere 
dealer or Case dealer — whoever is left. But very few of them 
will go there . . . [inaudible interjection] . . . John Deere will 
always be there. But very few of them will go there seeking 
employment and offering themselves as a trainee in the 
apprenticeship program. So I think that if we started working 
that angle younger with the high school crowd, we might in fact 
encourage a greater response from that group of young people 
as they graduate. 
 
And we have an excellent apprenticeship program here. I 
haven’t heard anybody complain about it. I’ve heard, you know, 
great success stories. And most of my acquaintances who’ve 
gone through it are really quite satisfied with the results of that 
particular program. So the more we can do in that area, the 
more I would support and encourage the government as it 
undertakes this kind of effort. 
 
Mr. Minister, I probably have a few more questions but my 
colleague would like to address some issues right now. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member from 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy Chair, and 
Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, a couple of questions regarding 
school division operations. Mr. Minister, have all school 
divisions in the province set their mill rates, and what was the 
date by which school divisions had to set that mill rate? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — With the exception of the 

Lloydminster division that was still waiting for Alberta 
assessment data was . . . all divisions have now set their mill 
rates. They were all set as of May 1. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. Mr. Minister, if a 
school board was setting its mill rate prior to May 1, would they 
have based that mill rate on the 2004 assessments, or would 
they have based that mill rate on estimated 2005 assessments? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — It was my understanding everyone was 
basing it on estimated 2005 assessments. It has been pointed out 
to me that normally the mill rates are set as of April 1. This 
year, in part because of reassessment, we moved that date to 
May 1. So they were all set as of May 1. So it’s my 
understanding everyone used the 2005 estimated data. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Minister, do your officials have the mill 
rates for school divisions on the east side of the province? Have 
those been submitted? And specifically would you know what 
the mill rate is of Eastland Lakes? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — We have received them although we 
didn’t bring it with us tonight. We can endeavour to do that. 
We’ve got the list for each of the divisions. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Minister, the point that I want to make is 
. . . And I’m glad that I heard you say 2005 estimates because in 
the RM of . . . I’m sorry, in the school division of Eastland 
Lakes there are 16 rural municipalities that contribute a taxable 
assessment to that school division, and there are 15 urban 
communities. And I think you’re aware of the switch that has 
occurred in assessments. 
 
I had to contact three . . . or in fact contacted four RMs today to 
determine what their taxable assessment was. And that 
information, to my knowledge, is not at the division office 
level, at the school division office level. And, Mr. Minister, I’m 
just going to give you these examples, and I think you’ll 
understand I think the predicament that farmers are finding 
themselves in today. In the RM of Sliding Hills the taxable 
assessment has increased by 29.5 per cent. The RM of St. 
Phillips has increased by 41.5 per cent. The RM of Buchanan 
by 38.5 per cent and the RM of Preeceville by 41.5. Those are 
just the four that I’ve contacted, Mr. Minister. And I don’t 
know what the other 12 will be, but I’m suspecting that on the 
east side of the province all of the RMs will be affected pretty 
similarly. We’re hearing the complaints of farmers. 
 
Now when I look at the urban component — the town of 
Canora, which is the largest community, urban community in 
that school division — that taxable assessment has increased by 
2 per cent. And the town of Norquay, which is one of the other 
urban communities that I called, the taxable assessment has 
declined by 19.8 per cent. 
 
Mr. Minister, in the Eastland Lakes School Division, the 
taxable assessment for the entire school division, the rural 
component is $5.4 million and the urban component produces a 
revenue of 2.1 million. So if there is going to be a huge increase 
on the RM side in the taxable assessment — an average of 30 
per cent, 35 per cent; we don’t know for sure — and if the 
urban component has not changed dramatically because the 
largest community, the town of Canora, has in fact increased by 



May 25, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 3177 

2 per cent, there would have been tremendous flexibility in the 
mill rate that the school division would use. 
 
Now as I said, I’m encouraged to hear you say that it was set on 
the new 2005 assessments. But my question is, if it hasn’t been 
set on those new assessments and was set on the ’04 
assessments, what system is in place to allow flexibility for the 
school division after they take a look at the fact that they may 
have as much as a $75 million increase in their taxable 
assessment? Will there be a procedure that you will allow for 
school divisions to revisit the whole assessment, mill rate 
component? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — I’m advised that in the case of Eastland 
Lakes that they would have used the 2005 assessment data, and 
so this should not be an issue. 
 
But it will, as the member has indicated, there’s been a dramatic 
shift from the western side of the province to the eastern side of 
the province in terms of assessed wealth of the land, and this 
has caused us with some real upward pressure on property taxes 
on the eastern side of the province. There’s no doubt about that. 
It correspondingly has reduced on some pasture land, and then 
the western side, the assessment has gone down. 
 
This will need to get sorted out by boards in terms of what the 
mill rate is that they set. As the assessment goes up, they should 
be generating more money per mill which should give them 
some ability to reduce that mill rate then. They will need to take 
a look at that. We haven’t looked at Eastland Lakes specifically 
as to what they did with the mill rate, to what extent they — for 
lack of a better term — profit took by keeping the rate higher 
and to what extent they reduced it to compensate for the shift in 
assessment. Those are decisions that the individual boards 
would need to do. 
 
We did however use the 2005 assessment data to set the grants 
and to do our calculations, and so the grants would be reflective 
of that. For the most part that will mean on the eastern side, the 
grants have likely gone down. On the western side, grants have 
gone up. I think that the number I provided to the member, one 
of the opposition members yesterday, was that about 35 
divisions saw a decrease in their grant. There should be about a 
corresponding number that will have seen an increase. 
 
But it is one of the I think as all of us know — and certainly 
from the debate that was going on with Government Relations, 
all of us know — this is a very imperfect system, and a very 
difficult one because of the fluctuations it causes. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. My final question 
. . . And I would hope that your officials, maybe Mr. Sangster 
would be able to supply the new assessment for both the rural 
component and the urban component. Currently the rural 
component for 2004 had an assessment of 5.436 million and the 
urban component was 2.115 million, with a total taxable 
assessment of 7.551. If the ’05 numbers are dramatically 
different, would you be able to supply that in the next couple 
days? And then subsequently, as you’ve indicated, there has 
been a grant change. Could you indicate what the grant changes 
were from ’04 to ’05? Thank you for that. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Yes we can provide that information. 

And I suspect it’s probably easiest for us just to provide it 
across the province. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — I recognize the member from Cypress 
Hills. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to spend 
a few moments in what time we have left today talking about a 
new program that I understand was instituted under a 
government directive, sponsored by the Labour department’s 
WorkSafe program, a new occupational health and safety 
program being offered at SIAST. Now as I understand it, there 
wouldn’t be anything unusual about that except for the fact that 
my understanding is that type of program was offered at the two 
universities previously. Can the minister comment on the need 
for the new program and the purpose of moving it to SIAST 
from the universities? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — I think it’s very much, as the member 
would anticipate, is we take a look at where the potential risk is 
to employees. In many cases it is in the trades and in the 
technical areas that are under SIAST’s purview. That was 
largely why the decision was to support that being built into the 
SIAST programming. I think it makes some sense. It doesn’t in 
any way diminish the program. It just brings it closer to the 
higher risk employer groups, employee groups. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Were there concessions that were made to the 
two universities as a result of the transfer of this program to 
SIAST? And were they involved in the transfer of the program? 
I guess the question becomes also, did the program as it existed 
at the two universities move in its entirety to SIAST, or did we 
start from scratch with a new program at the SIAST location? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — As I understand what had happened 
was as they looked at the SIAST program, they simply built on 
the strength of the university programs and adapted it to meet 
the needs of SIAST students. 
 
It is however I think a program that all members would want to 
support. It is a very positive initiative to try and deal with 
occupational health and safety issues. And it was only a few 
weeks ago that we all stood in this House to commemorate the 
. . . I think this year it was 26 of our citizens who had been 
killed in workplace accidents. This is something that is just 
completely unacceptable, and I’m very pleased the Department 
of Labour has done work to try and bring this closer to trades 
education. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. I had asked also if 
there were any concessions offered to the universities for the 
moving of the program. Thank you. 
 
One last area in the limited time we’ve got. You and I both 
attended the announcement at the U of R Faculty of Business 
Administration where we had the recognition of the gift by 
Kenneth Levene and the changing of the name of the school 
there to the Kenneth Levene graduate school of business. And 
in my understanding that was by far the most significant gift 
that had been given to the U of R and may be for some time. 
 
I’m just wondering, does the government, does the Department 
of Learning play any role in the solicitation of those kinds of 



3178 Saskatchewan Hansard May 25, 2005 

undertakings? 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — The universities have over the last 
several years really moved forward in terms of their program to 
encourage alumni support for capital projects and ongoing 
operating support as well as bringing in more corporate 
donations. Certainly the gift by Kenneth Levene was extremely 
generous and is . . . I think the member for Cypress Hills, as I 
was, I’m sure was quite moved by the personal history that Mr. 
Levene shared with us in terms of his family moving here, 
starting a business here, and wanting to give back to his 
community. 
 
The decisions about which donations are accepted, what the 
size of donations need to be to receive the kind of recognition 
that may be attached to it, are all decisions made by the 
universities themselves and are largely without any involvement 
or consultation with the provincial government. 
 
Mr. Elhard: — Thank you, Mr. Minister. The motivation for 
giving that large sum, $4 million, and the story that Mr. Levene 
told that day as part of his explanation for the gift, and I guess 
the sheer size of the gift, I think is the kind of thing we want to 
see more of in this province. 
 
I had just enough of experience personally with the American 
post-secondary education system to know that they have 
capitalized on these types of gifts in a very substantive way. 
And that is why universities seem to flourish there — because 
their alumni take it as a personal obligation to support those 
schools to an ever-increasing amount. It almost seems like 
there’s a competition sometimes among alumni to see who can 
give more. 
 
[17:15] 
 
If we can motivate people in this province where we have 
produced, you know, literally thousands of brilliant and capable 
people who have gone on to be very successful, if we can 
motivate them to give back to their schools from which they 
have benefited so substantially, I think that that augurs well for 
the future of schools, for the opportunity for funding 
scholarships, for all kinds of program development and support. 
I think it’s a good thing. And I think we need to encourage this 
type of donation, this type of philanthropy, if we can possibly 
do so. 
 
So having seen what Mr. Levene did for the University of 
Regina, I know that’s been replicated in a couple of instances at 
the University of Saskatchewan. I think we need to celebrate 
those kinds of gifts and encourage that type of giving in the 
future by grads of these various schools. 
 
Mr. Minister, that concludes our questions for today. It certainly 
doesn’t conclude the material that we had to work with. But I 
have no further questions. Thank you for your time and that of 
your officials. 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Deputy 
Chair. I appreciated the opportunity to have this discussion. I 
know that we’ll have many more opportunities as we review the 
annual report for the Department of Learning in committee to 
have discussion about this. 

Let me simply conclude with two comments. First of all, to say 
that I agree with the member opposite. The support of the 
alumni of our post-secondary institutions is really critical to 
seeing them grow and take their place as pre-eminent 
institutions in this country. I was reminded several days ago as I 
was making an announcement in the agriculture building at the 
U of S [University of Saskatchewan] of the tremendous 
outpouring of support that people had at that point to build that 
institution, that particular building. I was particularly struck by 
a marker indicating that the Hutterites of Saskatchewan had 
donated. The Hutterite population does not actively participate 
as students in the universities and yet they understood the 
importance of that institution to their success. That’s part of the 
Saskatchewan spirit and that is something we want to 
encourage. 
 
Secondly, I want to thank my officials for joining me tonight. I 
want to say in particular a special thank you to Wayne McElree, 
who is the assistant deputy minister and will be retiring at the 
end of June. He has served our department extremely well and 
the people of Saskatchewan and will be significantly missed. I 
suspect we’ll miss him more than he’ll miss us, but nevertheless 
just on behalf of myself and I would say on behalf of all 
colleagues in the Assembly I want to thank you, Wayne, for 
your work. And thank the members opposite for the questions 
tonight. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Thomson: — I would with that move that we rise, 
report progress, and ask for leave to sit again, Mr. Deputy 
Chair. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — The Minister of Learning has asked the 
committee to report progress and ask for leave to sit again. Is 
that agreed? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Deputy Chair: — Motion carried. 
 
The Speaker: — The Deputy Chair of committees is 
recognized. 
 
Mr. Iwanchuk: — The committee has asked me to report 
progress and ask for leave to sit again. 
 
The Speaker: — And when shall the committee sit again? I 
recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — With leave later today, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Later today. The Chair recognizes the 
Government House Leader.
