LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 

Third Session — Thirteenth Legislature 

12th Day 

 

Friday, February 27, 1959 
 

The House met at 2:30 o’clock p.m. 

 

On the Orders of the Day: 

 

WELCOME TO STUDENTS 

 

Mrs. J. E. Cooper (Regina City): — Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with I 

would like to draw the attention of the members of the Legislature to a group of Central Collegiate 

students who are visiting us, today, together with their teacher, Mrs. Harding. 

 

I know that by the time they hear the Budget Address they will have a much better idea of how the 

revenues of this Province are spent. 

 

I am sure the members would all like to join with me in welcoming them here this afternoon. 

 

QUEEN OF THE NORTH 

 

Mr. John J. Harrop (Athabasca): — Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with, I 

would like to bring the attention of the Assembly to the news that Miss Jean Cuthand of Lac la Ronge 

has won the title of ‘Queen of the North’ at the Trappers Festival at The Pas, Manitoba. 

 

Miss Cuthand is the head nurse at the hospital at Lac la Ronge and I am sure all members would like to 

join me in offering congratulations to her. 

 

CORRECTION 

 

Mrs. Mary J. Batten (Humboldt): — Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the Day are proceeded with I 

would like to draw the attention of the House to an error that was made in the report by the Moose Jaw 

paper, and also in the “Leader-Post”, reporting a speech that I made to the Liberal Association in Moose 

Jaw. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! That is not the concern of this Assembly. 

 

Mrs. Batten: — There was an error in the paper and it has to do with the House. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — Order! It was not something that was said in this House.

Mrs. Batten: — It is very misleading, because it seems to indicate that this was said in the House, as 

well as at the meeting. 

 

Mr. Speaker: — But the matter was not a matter which was reported from this House. I am afraid it is 

out of order. 

 

SALE OF PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS LEASES 

 

Hon. J. H. Brockelbank (Minister of Mineral Resources): — Mr. Speaker, before the Orders of the 

Day are proceeded with I am pleased to announce to the House that a sale of Petroleum & Natural Gas 

Leases was held at 3:00 p.m. on February 24, 1959. Bids were invited for standard leases or net royalty 

leases; 41 parcels of land were advertised for sale. Bids were received on 27 parcels and 14 parcels 

received no bids. Bids were accepted for 20 standard leases and for two net royalty leases. Total cash 

received from the sale was $1,829,014.26. 

 

BUDGET ADDRESS 

 

Hon. C. M. Fines (Provincial Treasurer): — Mr. Speaker, in rising today to present the traditional 

Motion of Supply, may I just refer briefly to the unusual degree of public attention that has been 

focussed this year upon the annual budget message. As you might well expect, I have been greatly 

interested in the many speculative stories in the newspapers and on radio, attempting to forecast the 

Province’s balance sheet for 1959-60. I think this attention, and even the speculation, is all to the good 

— even though it would seem that the pundits have been mainly concerned about the gloomy possibility 

of a so-called “deficit budget”. One can well understand that a change of this kind, following upon the 

fifteen years of uninterrupted budget surpluses achieved by the present government, would certainly 

rank as news. But deficit or otherwise, we all know that year by year government budgets are coming to 

play an increasingly larger role in the daily lives of all our citizens. This merely underlines the great 

need for an informed public understanding of the many complex issues involved in budget-making. 

Anything that will contribute to intelligent awareness of these problems is therefore very much 

worthwhile; and I am hopeful that the press gallery will not be disappointed in any way in the 

newsworthiness of this budget. 

 

In any event, a heightened interest in public finance is certainly evident this year. No doubt it stems 

directly from the widespread concern over the rather disturbed and contradictory trends prevailing in the 

national economy. It is, then, to a summary view of this essential background that I should first turn 

today. 

 

In looking back upon the developments of 1958, we may recall that

the first half of the year was marked by a carryover of the fairly severe national recession that began 

early in 1957. Fortunately the decline was checked, and by the end of the year a recovery phase was 

apparently well under way. Several factors were influential in this reversal of the business cycle. 

Personal income and expenditure remained high, despite the effects of the recession. Government 

expenditure at all levels expanded greatly, with increased public investment largely counter-balancing a 

fall in business capital spending. The rapid liquidation of business inventories came to a halt, and a 

slight build-up began about the last quarter. Similarly, although export trade for the entire period fell 

slightly below the level of 1957, an encouraging pick-up was evident at the close of the year. 

Significantly for Saskatchewan, the relatively high export total was due in large measure to increases in 

exports of wheat, beef cattle and uranium, which offset widespread declines in other commodities. 

 

Despite the apparent end of the decline, however, the national economic accounts for 1958 are expected 

to show a final gross national product of only slightly more than $32 billion, a gain of about 2 per cent. 

In terms of real dollars per person, this is actually lower than in 1957. The slack in the economy, 

reflecting an under-utilization of both manpower and physical plant, was perhaps most obvious in the 

employment situation. Throughout the year, the level of unemployment was appreciably higher than for 

most of the entire postwar period. The last official estimate of the numbers of persons out of work and 

seeking jobs across the country amounted to almost 9 per cent of the civilian labour force. 

Unemployment at this level is clearly more than a normal seasonal problem. 

 

The year 1958 also revealed more sharply than ever before the economic paradox of our times. Despite 

the evidence of a severe recession in the national economy, there was the contradictory evidence of the 

phenomenon known as “modern” or “creeping” inflation. This description is intended to distinguish it 

from the more familiar kind of “galloping” inflation, frequently summarized in simple terms by “too 

much money chasing too few goods”. That this latter was not the problem in Canada is clearly seen in 

the fact that the level of industrial output remained substantially below the capacity of industry to 

produce. The persistence of price advances, in the face of severe unemployment and curtailed demand is 

due in large part to the increasing rigidities being built into our pricing system through modern 

institutional forces. It is true as well, however, that the fiscal and monetary policy of the Federal 

Government in 1958 — involving as it has a very substantial increase in the money supply — has 

contributed materially to latent inflationary pressure. 

 

In looking to the economic prospect ahead, then, two major hazards seem to complicate the national 

scene — unemployment and inflation. On balance, present indications suggest that at least a moderate 

rate of recovery will prevail. With capital investment intentions still in doubt and excess plant capacity 

still to be absorbed, however, so far there is little evidence of a full-scale boom in the making. 

Nevertheless, there is reason to anticipate that the most urgent problems of cyclical unemployment 

should be eased.

In some quarters there appears to be considerably more optimism about the possibility of the recovery 

rapidly swelling in vigour and threatening a genuinely inflationary push on the price level. At the 

moment this seems to be based chiefly upon unpredictable psychological factors. But it is relevant to 

note that in the United States the President’s recent economic report forecasts that continued economic 

recovery together with only a modest decrease in expenditure should result in a balanced budget for 

1959-60. 

 

This view of the prospect ahead suggests that we now seem launched upon the narrow and precarious 

channel that leads between the sirens of inflation and the whirlpool of depression. Those in Ottawa 

charged with piloting our ship have a heavy responsibility. In my own mind they could undoubtedly do 

the job better if they accepted the broad principles of economic and social planning consistently 

advocated by members on this side of the House. But as it is, we can only wish them well and bend our 

own efforts in provincial financing so as not to make their task more difficult. 

 

Turning now to the Saskatchewan picture itself, it is most encouraging to note that the provincial 

economy weathered both the effects of the national recession and the continuing squeeze in agriculture 

in surprisingly good shape. The gross value of commodity output rose about seven per cent in 1958. 

Non-farm sources contributed almost two-thirds of the total — striking evidence of the long strides we 

have taken in our march toward a more diversified, balanced economic base. Personal income receipts 

more than kept pace, advancing about nine per cent to the level of $1,095 million. 

 

Reflecting the additions to output of recent new and expanded plants, manufacturing production rose to 

an estimated $326 million, up about 8 per cent over 1957. The mineral industries increased their 

production total by 28 per cent, and Saskatchewan replaced British Columbia as the fourth largest 

producer of mineral wealth among the provinces. Construction was sustained at peak levels in spite of a 

considerable decline in oil exploration and preliminary data strongly indicate that the capital investment 

“intentions” figure of $626 million will have been surpassed. The service industries, particularly in the 

larger centres, have reported a good year. This is reflected in expanded consumer expenditure, with 

retail trade rising to $885 million, a gain of almost 5 per cent. 

 

These records of economic growth were achieved, as I have suggested, despite continuing difficulties in 

agriculture. Rainfall during the 1958 growing season was less than two-thirds of normal and it was only 

providential rains late in the season that enabled the crops to make a near miraculous recovery. The 

year’s experience does lend support to the contention that improved techniques of dryland farming have 

come a long way toward lessening the hazard of scant rainfall, contributing to an increasing stability of 

agricultural production. 

 

Farm cash income registered a gain of about 10 per cent in 1958, and is now estimated at $595 million. 

The livestock industry was the major factor in this increase. An appreciably higher level of cattle 

marketings, 



 

February 27, 1959

coupled with firming of prices, and an upsurge in volume of hog deliveries, boosted income from 

livestock past the $130 million mark, about one-third higher than in 1957. 

 

In the grain sector of the agricultural economy, it was only the depletion of carry-over stocks on farms, 

together with the P.F.A.A. and wheat acreage payments, that sustained cash receipts. Farm net income is 

estimated at only about $215 million, only slightly up from the unusually depressed level of 1957. In 

fact the squeeze between costs and prices has completely nullified all the advantage that should have 

been won by our farmers as a result of the better than average grain deliveries they achieved over the 

past two years. In terms of real purchasing power, moreover, farm net income in 1957 and 1958 has 

fallen 53 per cent below the average for the period 1946-56. It is this desperate situation — extending all 

the way to the grassroots — that clearly underlies the decision of prairie farmers to send their mass 

delegation to Ottawa next March 10th. 

 

Effective action by the Federal Government in offsetting the cost-price squeeze on prairie agriculture 

would, of course, be the most important stimulus the overall provincial economy could possible receive. 

In any case, Canada is expected to maintain her position in world wheat trade during the 1958-59 crop 

year and to export about 3,000 million bushels of wheat and flour. This in turn should make possible 

fairly normal farm deliveries for the better part of 1959. The prospect for continued high levels of cattle 

and hog marketings should also help to sustain cash income from livestock at close to the record level of 

1958. However, there are grounds for some apprehension concerning the grain crop in the year ahead 

because of inadequate sub-soil moisture and fairly widespread grasshopper infestation. Assuming 

normal crops, I think we can anticipate only a slight decline in farm cash receipts. On the other hand a 

short crop in 1959 would be directly reflected in a sharp reduction of both cash and net income, with 

resultant repercussions throughout the whole provincial economy. 

 

As against this, the prospects for continued industrial growth are bright. The recovery of the national and 

international economies should give added stimulus to the further development of most of our non-farm 

resources. New production records are again forecast in the petroleum industry; uranium will rise to 

peak levels on the basis of existing contracts; base metals will reflect firming world prices for copper 

and zinc; and the first full year of potash mining and refining may also see a second major producer 

commence operations. All told, the value of mineral production may climb close to $260 million in 

1959. 

 

The outlook is also good for an accelerating pace in the expansion of manufacturing industries. Thus, 

since its inception in 1948, the provincial Industrial Development Fund has made a total of 48 loans; but 

twelve applications were approved in 1958 alone. No doubt the most important stimulus to future 

growth will be the establishment of a basic steel industry. Late this year or early in 1960 both the 

$15,000,000 mill now being constructed by Interprovincial Steel and the structural fabricating plant of 

Dominion Bridge will be completed. I think we have now set in motion a process of growth in 

manufacturing, the very momentum of which will prove to be a highly strategic factor in further 

expansion.

Comprehensive forecast data on investment and construction in 1959 are not yet available. But it seems 

likely that the peak levels of the past two years will be maintained. One of the most important long-

range developments, of course, is the South Saskatchewan River Development Project, where a total 

outlay of about $8-$10 million is expected this year. Unlike many other large projects where a major 

part of the investment is required to be spent on materials and equipment imported into the Province, the 

bulk of this expenditure will be devoted to on-site construction work, with resultant direct benefits to the 

provincial economy. 

 

Taking the overall picture then, the outlook for the Saskatchewan economy in 1959 is a distinctly 

favourable one. Without attempting to minimize either the difficulties apparent in agriculture or the 

important part it occupies in our economy, I think we shall see further solid diversification and growth 

over the next 12 month period. While the movement away from the farm continues year by year, the 

level of industrial employment is seedily advancing, affording new opportunities for retaining 

population growth. On the basis of current data on interprovincial migration, the chances are good that 

our population will rise to well over 900,000 by next June — a gain of more than 70,000 people since 

the census of 1951. We have come a long way since the disaster of the thirties — and to my mind, the 

most encouraging development of all has been the widespread evidence of a new faith and a new 

confidence shared by the people of Saskatchewan in the future of their own province. 

 

I turn now, Mr. Speaker, to the Province’s finances. The Public Accounts for 1957-58 were tabled at the 

beginning of the Session. Honourable Members will note that their form has been changed to the new 

basis which was discussed at this Legislature’s Public Accounts Committee during the 1957 Session, 

and which was outlined in a monograph tabled last year. It is my hope that in this new form the accounts 

will assist Honourable Members in their task of appraising and analyzing the financial policy of the 

Government. 

 

The accounts reveal that last fiscal year the Province enjoyed a budgetary surplus of $13,166,511. This 

surplus, combined with sinking fund earnings, brought about a reduction in the net debt of $14 million, 

from $38.9 million to $24.9 million. 

 

A booming -s economy caused revenues to rise to nearly $133 million. The principal increased occurred 

in petroleum and natural gas revenues, which rose by $3.0 million; in gasoline tax collections, which 

rose by $2.7 million; and in liquor profits, which rose by more than $800,000. Expenditures totalled 

$119,663,473, including $98.6 million of ordinary expenditures and $21.0 million of capital 

expenditures. 

 

The financial picture for the current year is, as we all know, not as bright as last year, but it is 

remarkably good. As a result of the high levels of personal income in this province, education and 

hospitalization tax collections and liquor profits have continued to be buoyant. For the same reason 

gasoline tax and vehicle licence revenues have increased. 

 

On the other hand, federal-provincial tax-sharing revenues, which 



 

February 27, 1959

depend on the levels of corporate profits and personal income taxes in Ontario and British Columbia, 

show a decline from the federal estimate of $36.5 million, and our estimate of $34.5 million, to $33.8 

million. Further, there has been a reduction in the prices paid for crown oil rights owing to declining 

foreign markets for oil and the resulting slow-down in oil exploration activity in the Province. 

 

With certain notable exceptions, expenditures have been running according to plan. Supplementary 

estimates which were tabled today outline the special expenditures which were authorized this year. 

These include additional appropriations of $603,000 for employment-creating projects, an increase of 

$1.2 million for grid road and municipal bridge construction, a sum of $325,000 to help farmers to 

secure emergency supplies of feed and fodder, and a further $1,481,000 for the Hospital Service Plan. 

 

Taking the revenue and expenditure outlook together, I expect that this year the Province will just about 

break even. There may, in fact, be a small surplus of something like one per cent of the anticipated 

revenues. For the calendar year, however, I can be more definite, Mr. Speaker. I am happy to announce 

that during 1958 the net debt of the Province was reduced by $5,851,048 to $26 million. This means a 

net debt of less than $30 per capita, compared with nearly four times that amount just ten years ago. 

 

During the year all debentures and treasury bills were repaid as they matured, without the necessity of 

any refunding operations. In addition, prior redemption of certain debentures was made from 

accumulated sinking funds. During the present fiscal year there have been debt redemptions of 

$20,357,958, of which $15,163,908 were received from the Saskatchewan Power Corporation and the 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones and from the sinking funds. 

 

Older members of the Legislature have become accustomed to the use of the comparative statement of 

net debt as used in this Province for some thirty years and as used in other provinces of Canada. As 

indicated in previous years, the results are bound to be somewhat different than through the use of the 

balance sheet method of determination of net debt. The latter counts as assets the cash on hand, working 

advances and other loans and advances that will be repaid. However, in order that Honourable Members 

can make comparisons with previous years and with other provinces, with your permission, Mr. 

Speaker, I shall again include the statement. 

 

This statement shows a total reduction of over $10 million in the past year, and of $22,600,000 in the 

last two years.

The past year has again been a period of difficulty in obtaining money for capital purposes. Honourable 

Members will recall that the programs for both Power and Telephones were record-breaking. We 

undertook to borrow $57 million for Power and $10,800,000 for Telephones. As indicated to you a year 

ago, of this amount we had borrowed $25 million on December 2nd, 1957. We were very successful in 

raising $25 million on the U.S. market last April at the time when prices were most favourable. This 

amount was borrowed at 4.15% for a period of 25 years. Shortly after I arranged another private loan in 

Canada for $5.0 million. This was for a four year period and was borrowed at 3.9%. 

 

In July the Federal Government announced the conversion loan and thus destroyed any hopes of any 

successful provincial loans for several months. We therefore decided to use our own resources to finance 

the $10,800,000 requirements of Telephones. We had over $10 million of Victory Bonds in various 

Government controlled accounts. We did not convert these except for a few short-term bonds, but 

instead, used the proceeds to make a provincial issue of $10,800,000, due in 1983. These bonds have a 

5% coupon and were sold at par. Thus we were able to complete the borrowing program at an early date, 

except for $2.0 million for Power, which has since been obtained in a new issue of $25 million for 

Power and Telephones, obtained on January 2nd. We have more recently borrowed $8.0 million on the 

Canadian market. The prospects for provincial borrowing at this time are not favourable because of the 

large requirements of the Federal Government and the investors’ lack of confidence in bonds because of 

the recent awakening to the dangers of inflation. However, with over $30 million already secured for 

next year’s program, I am confident we can raise the balance required. The following table indicates the 

bonds sold during the present fiscal year:

In accordance with standing practice, the annual reports of our provincial crown corporations are being 

tabled in the House for examination as rapidly as they can be completed. The final statements have not 

yet all been audited, but 1958 has clearly been one of the best years on record. 

 

Reflecting the general strength of the provincial economy, the total volume of business transacted by the 

whole group of thirteen enterprises rose to $71 million, an increase of more than 12 per cent over 1957. 

At the year-end, the number of workers employed stood at close to 5,500, and the wage and salary bill 

for the year amounted to $21 million, up by 15 per cent. The companies made payments to 

municipalities in lieu of taxes of some $564,000. In addition, the public treasury received over $578,000 

in royalty revenues. 

 

The statement of advances and earnings included with this address shows the financial results of 

continuing large-scale expansion in the Power Corporation and Government Telephones. At the end of 

the year our advances to these two utilities stood at $262,159,000, and their gross revenue, before 

deductions for interest, amounted to $12,672,000, compared to $10,757,000 in 1957.

 Deficit 

   

 

At fiscal year ends outstanding advances held by the eleven enterprises reporting to the Government 

Finance Office had been reduced to $9,056,000. The gross revenues, again without taking into account 

the cost of money, amounted to $1,284,000. This represents a return of over 14% on our outstanding 

investment, and the dividend payable to the Treasury, to be included in our budgetary revenues for the 

next fiscal year, has been increased from $800,000 to $1 million. 

 

Among the highlights of the year were the record earnings of the Insurance Office and the Sodium 

Sulphate Division of Saskatchewan Minerals. In the face of seriously depressed markets for lumber and 

pulpwood, the Timber Board achieved record sales and a very satisfactory rate of return. The remaining 

enterprises maintained a high level of service — in transportation, printing, and marketing — and the 

only one of the companies to incur a deficit, Saskatchewan Government Airways, nevertheless carried 

on its essential transportation role in the development of the North. 

 

As Honourable Members know, two of the crown companies serving the people of our northern regions, 

the Fish Marketing Service and Government Trading, are now to be re-organized as co-operatively 

owned enterprises.

Over the past ten years, these two divisions have handled sales and services totalling some $11,000,000, 

and have paid their way without cost to the Government. At the same time they have performed tasks of 

real social and economic significance to the fishermen and trappers concerned. Building upon these 

foundations, I feel sure that the new co-operatives will prove to be effective instruments for the further 

development of the North and its people. 

 

I have spent some little time, Mr. Speaker, sketching the economic and financial background against 

which the budget for next year was formulated, since it is within this context that the budget must be 

judged. 

 

First, let me set at rest the minds of those who have speculated so energetically about this 1959-60 

budget — it is a balanced budget. And it has been balanced without any increase in taxation. 

 

Budgetary revenues have been estimated at $133,325,210, and budgetary expenditures at $133,245,440, 

leaving a nominal surplus of $80,000. Revenue estimates are, of course, based on the Government’s 

appraisal of Canada’s and Saskatchewan’s economic outlook for 1959. With personal income expected 

to remain high next year, I have estimated a modest rise in education and hospitalization tax collections 

to $20.2 million. Gasoline tax collections are set at $19.9 million and motor vehicle licence collections 

at $6.9 million, both reflecting not only higher levels of personal income but also a continued increase in 

road use. 

 

Recurring revenues from mineral and other natural resources are expected to rise from $17.4 million to 

$19.3 million. Of these, petroleum and natural gas revenues are set at $12.8 million, other mineral 

revenues at $4.0 million, and revenue from the balance of our natural resources at $2.5 million. 

However, non-recurring oil revenues — those from the sale of crown oil rights — have been severely 

reduced to $5.0 million in light of this year’s experience. 

 

To estimate our other major source of revenue — federal tax-sharing payments — one must make a 

judgment concerning economic activity in Canada as a whole. Our expectation is that 1959 levels of 

corporate profits and personal income taxes will be somewhat higher than this year, enough to warrant a 

slight increase in expected revenue from this source. I have estimated these tax-sharing revenues at 

$34.2 million, up from the present estimate of $33.8 million for the current year. 

 

In summary, Mr. Speaker, our best estimate is that revenues for 1959-60 will reach $133 million. With 

this year’s expenditures running at around $134 million, the Government had to decide whether to 

choose the difficult course of balancing the budget, by raising taxes or cutting back expenditures, or the 

easier course of budgeting for a deficit, to be financed by borrowing. We chose the course which we 

think is the right one, Mr. Speaker. We balanced the budget. Let me tell you why.

February 27, 1959

Canadian governments, particularly the Federal Government, but we believe also provincial 

governments, must accept responsibility for planned economic development in Canada — for high 

levels of employment, for stable price levels, for balanced economic growth. This means that budgets 

must be formulated so as to achieve these goals as far as possible. And they must be altered as economic 

circumstances change. Thus it was that this Government moved from a $13 million surplus in 1957-58, a 

boom year, to a roughly balanced budget in the current year of recession. This action contributed in no 

small measure to the maintenance of high levels of income and employment in Saskatchewan, and 

constituted Saskatchewan’s share in creating employment elsewhere in Canada. 

 

If we believed that the recession would extend into 1959 and 1960, it would be appropriate for us to 

further Saskatchewan’s contribution by deficit financing. But if we believe, as we do, that there will be 

at least a moderate economic recovery, we should present another balanced budget. The reason for this 

is obvious: to deficit finance is to enter into competition next summer and fall with what we think will 

be higher levels of economic activity on the part of consumers, co-operatives, contractors and builders, 

and business generally. The result of any such action is equally obvious: this Government would be 

contributing to inflationary pressures and a resulting decline in the value of people’s savings. 

 

A great deal is being said these days about what governments should do to create employment and what 

they should do to control inflation. Some say governments should spend more to create employment, 

and others say they should spend less to contain inflation. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, we must get over the 

notion that there is a simple unplanned solution to these problems. Just spending more money doesn’t 

necessarily create jobs in regions where there is unemployment. Nor does it create jobs at the time of 

year when they are required, nor in the industries where high productivity is possible. Indiscriminate 

spending may very well, indeed, simply lead to a pressure for higher prices without doing the things it is 

meant to do. 

 

There is an answer, of course, but it is an answer that the old political parties are not prepared to accept 

— planned private and public investment. Indiscriminate and massive deficit financing which may or 

may not create the needed jobs, which is not supposed to interfere with so-called private enterprise, but 

which certainly sows the seeds of inflation, must give way to planned fiscal and monetary policies. To 

this viewpoint we are committed and for this reason we have consistently tried to introduce a greater 

measure of planning into the provincial budget. 

 

There is a second very good reason for submitting to Honourable Members a balanced budget. 

Saskatchewan, like all other provinces, has limited credit facilities, though they are vastly better than 

they were when this Government took office. We have consistently sought to use this limited 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

13 

 

credit to make what we conceive to be our maximum contribution to Saskatchewan’s economic growth 

— the expansion of electric power, of natural gas distribution, and of telephone and other 

communication facilities. If we were to borrow for public buildings, let us say, it would simply mean we 

would be unable to borrow as much for these highly productive enterprises. What is of more immediate 

concern to the taxpayer, to borrow is to add to his costs in future years. For 20 or 25 years he would pay 

interest on the debt incurred and this Government has no desire to so burden Saskatchewan taxpayers 

with dead-weight costs. Indeed, it has been one of our major accomplishments that such burdens have 

been reduced. Five years ago, for example, the annual interest burden borne by the taxpayers was 

$3,700.000; next year it will be less than one-half of this $1,784,000. 

 

In other words, this budget avoids adding dead-weight costs to the farmers and the taxpayers of the 

Province, and it permits the continuing expansion of our highly productive crown enterprises which 

have added so much to Saskatchewan’s economic growth. 

 

I said a moment ago, Mr. Speaker, that expenditures which are provided for in government budgets 

should be carefully planned to ensure that they achieve the government’s goals. Let me outline to 

Honourable Members what these goals are. The first one I have already discussed: the budget seeks to 

direct government expenditures so as to maximize economic growth and in so doing to create 

employment where employment is required. We have tried in drafting these expenditure plans to draw a 

timely balance between the programs which will stimulate immediate economic growth and those which 

will be of longer-run benefit. 

 

Second, the budget seeks to economize both in administrative costs and in programs so as to make 

possible maximum government service to the primary producers — the farmers — without increasing 

their costs through higher taxes. Special measures are being introduced to further assist agricultural 

producers, to the extent that we can do so as a province. 

 

Third, the budget provides for a continuation of the present high levels of health and welfare services 

and for a very substantial increase in the level of educational services. These are the programs which 

provide for that greater measure of equality which members on this side of the House have always 

advocated. The special emphasis which is given in this budget to education is present for three reasons: 

it is the best way of further extending equality of opportunity, it is a sure method of assisting local 

governments, and it is the best single way of ensuring the healthy growth and future well-being of this 

province. 

 

It has long been an objective of this Government to stimulate and encourage a more balanced growth of 

Saskatchewan’s economy. I need hardly remind Honourable Members of the very gratifying success that 

has so far met our efforts. Ten years ago mining contributed only 5.0 per cent of the Province’s 

production, today it contributes nearly 18.5 per cent; manufacturing contributed 7.3 per cent of the 

Province’s production ten years ago, now it contributes 15.9 per cent; and the construction industry 

contributed 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

14 

10.0 per cent of the Province’s production ten years ago now contributes 24.4 per cent. 

 

After more than a decade of growth, the time has come, we believe, to take stock of our progress and to 

lay plans for future development. Consequently, we have employed a highly qualified team of Canadian 

and American consultants to undertake a broad development survey of the Province. This survey will 

unquestionably be of great assistance in identifying those sectors of the economy which are capable of 

the greatest growth and will undoubtedly play a major part in shaping future budgets for resource and 

industrial development. 

 

Meantime, the 1959-60 budget seeks to achieve an appropriate balance in stimulating the various phases 

of Saskatchewan’s economy. The Government proposes to invest a further $36½ million in the Power 

Corporation to finance the Corporation’s continuing expansion plans. These plans include investment in 

a hydro dam at Squaw Rapids on the Saskatchewan River, the completion of the first stages of the new 

generating stations at Saskatoon and Boundary Dam, the continuation of the farm electrification 

program, and the connection of Yorkton and a number of major towns to the Province’s natural gas 

system. 

 

The Province will invest an additional $9.0 million in the communications industry through loans to 

Saskatchewan Government Telephones. During 1959-60 eleven thousand new telephones will be 

installed, over $1,000,000 will be invested in the extension of the Province’s micro-wave system, and 

the greatly improved long distance dialling system will be further extended. 

 

In the field of manufacturing, the help of the Industrial Development Fund will continue to be made 

available to firms wanting to locate new industries in Saskatchewan. One of the most important factors 

in promoting the growth of recent years has been the aggressive program of the Industrial Development 

Office, and the estimates provide for continuing expansion of this activity. As I have said, the major 

landmark for manufacturing development in 1959 will be the establishment of the basic steel mill in 

Regina. As Honourable Members know, the Government is assisting in this venture by guaranteeing the 

bonds of the Interprovincial Steel Corporation. 

 

As far as primary industry is concerned, 1958 has been marked by excess capacity. We look forward to 

higher levels of production from existing sources of supply, recognizing that additions to plant are not 

immediately required to meet today’s demand. Before many months have passed, however, additional 

plant will be required, and we fully expect that much of it will be developed in Saskatchewan. 

Consequently, while expanding other phases of this budget, we have been careful to maintain our 

resources development programs at their present high levels. Honourable Members will note, then, that 

the budgets of the Mineral and Natural Resources Departments provide for the continuation of such 

programs as forest conservation and renewal 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

15 

 

for additional mineral surveys but with greater emphasis on ground as opposed to aeromagnetic surveys, 

and for the continuation of petroleum and natural gas research and development programs. 

 

We are all aware, of course, of the truly remarkable expansion that has occurred in these sectors of the 

economy, particularly petroleum and natural gas development. We are all aware too, that the public very 

properly expects to share in the benefits of this expansion through the recovery of a part of the oil taken 

from crown lands by the oil companies. 

 

So far this has been achieved through leasing to the oil companies all crown lands except those which 

form a part of road allowances. These lands have always been dealt with separately — witness the 

Mineral Resources Act of 1931 which said: 

 

“The mines, minerals and mining rights in, on or under all public highways and road allowances shall 

continue to be vested in the Crown and may be leased or otherwise disposed of under the regulations.” 

 

It is proposed now to use these lands as a means of increasing the public return from crown lands. This 

will be done, not by leasing road allowances since that is not feasible, but by requiring the companies 

which are producing oil to share with the Government the oil which can be considered to have been 

drawn, on a pro rata basis, from under the road allowances, which adjoin their leases. I anticipate that 

this new measure, which will be explained in greater detail by my colleague the Minister of Mineral 

Resources, will net the Treasury approximately $500,000. 

 

Let me turn now, Mr. Speaker, to the estimates for roads and public works. For some years now we have 

become accustomed to thinking of roads in three categories: provincial highways, local roads including 

the municipal grid, and northern roads. The 1959-60 budget proposes that expenditures on all roads 

combined will be maintained at this year’s record levels, except for a reduction of $740,000 in the 

appropriations for northern roads. 

 

I pointed out in my last budget speech that for many years this Government has been active in building 

access and development roads in the North; in fact we have built more than 2,500 miles in 12 years. It 

seems to us appropriate, however, in a year when revenues are limited, that we should assign a higher 

priority to more urgent needs — specifically to main market roads and municipal bridges. There may be 

some who will argue that by doing this we are sacrificing federal dollars which have lately become 

available to assist us in our northern road program. To these people I shall only say this, Mr. Speaker: 

we do not propose to permit the Federal Government to cause us to divert our financial resources from 

the places where they are most needed to those where they are, for the moment, less needed. 

 

Road construction and maintenance in the southern part of the Province will be maintained at today’s 

peak levels. Aggregate expenditures 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

16 

of $30.2 million are proposed for the Department of Highways and the Municipal Road Assistance 

Authority, with some greater emphasis being placed this year on municipal roads as opposed to 

provincial highways. The continuation of these high levels of road expenditure are desirable not only 

because of the essential character of our road network, but also because our road program has been a 

steady source of employment for the people in the southern part of the Province. 

 

The greater emphasis on local roads proposed for next year will, I am sure be welcomed by all 

Honourable Members. For a number of years expenditures on provincial highways have been 

exceptionally high owing largely to the construction of the Trans-Canada Highway. Next year’s plans 

for placing greater emphasis on local roads will result in total appropriations of $6.2 million for this 

purpose. Included is $4.5 million for grid roads and bridges, an additional $500,000 for other municipal 

bridges, and $660,000 for municipal equalization grants. The Government is gratified that, as a result of 

the enthusiastic co-operation of the municipalities, the grid program is well ahead of schedule. 

 

In contrast to expenditures on roads, capital expenditures on public buildings will be slightly reduced in 

1959-60 from $6.5 million to $5 3/4 million. I have already pointed out that in our view our limited 

resources should be put to their most productive uses, such as financing power and gas expansion. This 

necessarily implies a reduction in expenditures on public buildings, a decline which, preliminary surveys 

suggest, will be more than offset by an increase in the tempo of other building activity. 

 

Included in the Public Works capital budget is provision for the continued construction of the Arts and 

Biology Buildings at the University of Saskatchewan, the completion of the first stage of the Provincial 

Technical Institute in Moose Jaw, and the completion of the Provincial Office Building in North 

Battleford and the Health and Welfare Building in Regina. The major new building for which provision 

is made is the much needed Court House in Regina to be started this year. 

 

I have pointed out, Mr. Speaker, that one of the principal reasons for this very rigorous pruning of the 

budget is our concern that nothing be done to aggravate the cost-price squeeze which is so deeply 

troubling our farmers today. We are perfectly aware, of course, that the Province by itself is unable to 

solve these agricultural problems. 

 

At the same time we all recognize that we must do everything we can, provincially, to help. First, we 

must continue to expand our services to individual farmers to assist them in maximizing production, and 

the returns from the family farm. This we are doing through the agricultural representative service and 

through the variety of specialists to be found in the Plant and Animal Industry Branches. We propose 

next year to strengthen these services by the addition of farm management specialists as and when such 

assistance is sought by the farmers. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

17 

 

Further, we are providing direct assistance through the Agricultural Machinery Administration which 

was established last year. This organization has developed, in just 12 months, an excellent system of 

inspection to ensure that farm implement dealers carry adequate stocks of repair parts; and it has already 

undertaken the farm machinery testing program which will guard the farmer against defective 

equipment. To further develop the work of this organization, a 23 per cent increase in its appropriations 

is being proposed. 

 

The second method of helping our agricultural producers, is to encourage measures which will assist 

them in establishing economic farm units. One obvious requirement is an adequate farm credit plan. 

Now we know that a province cannot hope to meet all the credit needs of its farmers; indeed the Royal 

Commission of Agriculture and Rural Life cautioned this province not to try. But there are things we can 

do. We can continue to try and persuade the Tory Government at Ottawa, as we tried to persuade the 

Liberal Government before them, to introduce a comprehensive credit plan — one that will truly enable 

farmers, as present schemes do not, to obtain the equipment and land and livestock necessary to convert 

their holdings into economic units. 

 

There is another thing we think we can do. We believe that we should try, in a modest way, to meet the 

problem of the transfer of the family farm to the younger generation. This troublesome problem is 

familiar to all of us, and is one which the Royal Commission believed we might properly tackle. 

Therefore, legislation is being introduced which will provide, through Saskatchewan’s co-operative 

movement, a farm credit plan to help young farmers establish themselves on economic family farm 

units. To accomplish this, the Province will make available its credit resources to the Co-operative Trust 

Company, in order that $10 million might be raised to finance this specialized credit scheme. The people 

of Saskatchewan, and particularly members of co-operatives, will be able to assist the plan by 

purchasing Trust Company bonds fully guaranteed by the Province. 

 

I would like to draw particular attention to our effort to make the conditions of the loans reasonable: 

modest security requirements and generous repayment terms have been provided for so that young 

farmers will be able to obtain the kind of help they need to establish themselves on the family farm. I 

only hope that the federal government will similarly improve the provisions of its farm credit legislation, 

and that we shall be able to integrate our plan with theirs at an early date. 

 

The third thing we must do for the agricultural industry is to begin to concentrate our resources on the 

South Saskatchewan River Dam Project. Provision is made in this budget for establishing a South 

Saskatchewan River Development Commission which will co-ordinate the multitude of activities which 

form a part of the project. Next year, too, we will make our first contribution toward the cost of the 

Dam, namely one-quarter of the $1.0 million which will have been spent this year. Also in 1959-60, 

preliminary irrigation studies costing some $120,000 will be made by the Department of Agriculture. All 

in all, we will spend next year just under 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

18 

$400,000. Future years, however, will see the expenditure of vast sums, with the result that we must be 

prepared temporarily to limit other conservation and development expenditures in order that we might 

get on with the major job. 

 

Side by side with these measures designed to increase the aggregate economic welfare of our province 

are those which provide for the equitable distribution of our wealth. Provision is made for an increase of 

approximately $1½ million in social aid and other public assistance payments. Part of this increase is 

undoubtedly due to the new social aid plan which has already been announced. Under this scheme the 

Province will underwrite all costs of social aid, and the municipalities will in turn make a flat per capita 

contribution toward the cost. We are confident that as a result of this change a person in need will 

receive prompt and considerate assistance without confronting the necessity of proving which 

municipality is financially responsible for him. 

 

Another reason for the increase in social aid costs is that the numbers of people requiring assistance 

always increases during an economic recession. As a matter of fact, these payments and unemployment 

insurance have done a great deal to keep consumer expenditures, and consequently general economic 

activity, buoyant. We on this side of the House who pioneered these programs can, I think, enjoy great 

satisfaction when we hear orthodox economists now solemnly endorsing these measures as effective 

devices for maintaining economic stability. 

 

A second major increase in the Welfare budget is to be found in the housing vote. Provision is made for 

a new housing policy designed to further encourage low rental housing projects. This policy provides for 

reducing the municipal capital contribution for public housing projects to five per cent of the costs, with 

the Province contributing 20 per cent, and the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation 75 per cent. 

Rental subsidies will be shared in the same proportion. As a further incentive for public housing 

projects, the Province proposes to relieve municipalities of all financial responsibility for housing 

surveys. 

 

There is another program which, in my opinion, warrants special mention, Mr. Speaker. That is the 

community development program in Northern Saskatchewan. For some years the Government has been 

engaged in studies seeking the best way of assisting the people of the North to assume greater 

responsibility for their own economic and social affairs, and, in the process, of improving their standard 

of living. We have now embarked on what we think is an exciting new program. 

 

Under the direction of our Northern Affairs Branch and with the assistance of the Centre for Community 

Studies at the University of Saskatchewan, a program has been initiated under which the people of the 

North will be encouraged gradually to assume complete responsibility for directing their own 

commercial, economic, and community affairs. A wide variety of co-operative community projects is 

being undertaken, such as electric power distribution systems, gardening schemes, co-operative stores 

and building projects. As I have already suggested, the re-organization of the Fish Marketing Service 

and Government Trading as co-operative ventures is planned to dovetail with this program. This co-

operative approach is the only one, we think, which will develop the kind of dynamic self-determination 

which we all hope for. 



 

February 27, 1959

Public Health expenditures will rise by approximately $7.5 million next year, exclusive of Federal 

reimbursements which bring the net budget to this year’s level. The principal changes are to be found in 

the Hospital Services Plan and in the appropriations for preventive health services. 

 

A major step has been taken toward making all hospital services a part of the Hospital Plan — a policy 

we have been urging on the Federal Government for the past several years. Starting in the current year, 

geriatric centres were put under the Plan, and beginning next year we will do the same with cancer 

clinics. In extending hospital insurance to cover the services of provincial geriatric centres, we are 

providing for an extensive increase in the medical care and rehabilitation facilities of these centres. As 

medical science extends the life expectancy of the population and the numbers of people over 65 or 70 

increase, it becomes more and more important that we find methods for keeping elderly people active, 

useful, and happy members of society. The experiments to be conducted will, we hope, point the way to 

a bold and imaginative program for the rehabilitation of the aged. 

 

Perhaps I should pause for a moment to explain to Honourable Members the disposition of the Federal 

Government reimbursement to the Hospital Plan. The amount of the reimbursement for 1959-60 is 

expected to be $13,250,000. Three years ago, when our expectation of federal payments to the Plan was 

renewed, we had hoped that these funds would be available for other purposes. At that time, hospital 

costs in Saskatchewan were running at about $22 million annually. Rising costs, increased utilization, 

and the inclusion of new groups which were formerly a federal responsibility have raised these costs to 

an estimated $33.3 million for 1959. Further, an amount of $1,686,000 has been returned to the 

taxpayers by the reduction of the family personal tax from $45 to $35. It is apparent, therefore, that the 

federal reimbursement will be used almost entirely for hospital purposes. 

 

Honourable Members will be aware, Mr. Speaker, that the Government has, over the years, been seeking 

to increase its emphasis on preventive health. This has been done through greatly enlarged staffs of 

public health nurses, sanitary officers, public health educators, and other specialists, in health regions. 

The budget for 1959-60 provides for the operation for a full year of the Melfort-Tisdale Health Region 

which was organized last month, and for the formation later in the years of the eleventh of the proposed 

twelve health regions. 

 

The major innovations of this budget are to be found in the appropriations for the Department of 

Education. As I have said, there are a number of reasons for this, Mr. Speaker. First, we are committed 

to the view, as I am sure all Honourable Members are, that the provision of freely available education 

services is the best means of achieving equality of opportunity. Second, from a purely economic 

standpoint, expenditures on education are probably the best means of increasing economic productivity 

since a well-trained labour force is essential if we are to increase provincial wealth. Third, this 

Government is committed, as revenues grow, to the acceptance of and ever increasing share of education 

costs. In this way we shall continue to make a major contribution toward keeping local tax rates down. 



 

February 27, 1959

The budget for 1959-60 provides for increased assistance both to students directly and to local school 

authorities. Students are now able to choose when they leave secondary school between a number of 

alternatives for further education. There is the University of Saskatchewan to which the Province will 

next year contribute $4.2 million, including $2.7 million in operating grants and $1.5 million in capital. 

There are the Teachers’ Colleges of Regina and Saskatoon and in 1959 there will be the Provincial 

Technical Institute in Moose Jaw. In other words, students are now able to obtain advanced training 

beyond high school level regardless of their interests or talents. 

 

To help them to do so Saskatchewan pioneered in the field of student aid by establishing some years ago 

a $1.0 million student loan fund. This year it is proposed to supplement these interest-free loans with 

provincial scholarships. These will be made available, on the basis of achievement, to assist students in 

their first year at University or Teacher’s College and their first year of special two year courses at the 

Provincial Technical Institute. The Legislature is being asked, Mr. Speaker, to appropriate $150,000 for 

this purpose. 

 

Finally, to assist local schools directly, this budget proposes an increase in school grants of $4.0 million, 

bringing such grants to a total of $24 million. This, Mr. Speaker, is an increase of 20 per cent in a single 

year and represents a doubling of school grants in just four years. As a matter of fact, the appropriations 

for school grants will equal in this single year all the school grants that were made during the 21 years 

between 1905 and 1926, or in all the 11 years between 1934 and 1944. 

 

I believe that we on this side of the House may be excused if we point with pride to our 

accomplishments since 1944 in the field of education. Primary and secondary school facilities have been 

vastly improved by the establishment of school units and the provision of these greatly expanded school 

grants; the quality of teacher training has been so improved that the certification of teachers in 

Saskatchewan now is the subject of favourable comment in Toronto’s Financial Post; University 

facilities have been more than doubled in a ten year period; and as I have said, the Provincial Technical 

Institute will be opening this fall. Parents of this province know that their children may now proceed 

from high school into almost any profession they choose, from plumbing to art to medicine. And they 

can do so largely at the expense of the Province. 

 

May I be pardoned if I suggest of Honourable Members that the budget for 1959-60 is a balanced budget 

in more ways than one. 

 

First, I have tried to preserve a balance between our desire to meet every reasonable demand for 

government services, and the need for maintaining a sense of fiscal responsibility. We all know that 

government expenditures, whether current or capital, must sooner or later be met by the taxpayer. And it 

seems to me there is today a disturbing tendency to accept deficit financing, or borrowing for capital 

expenditures, without adequate regard to its effect on the economy or to its future impact on levels of 

taxation. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

21 

 

Second, we have sought, in this as in previous budgets, to strike an appropriate balance between the use 

of funds for the development of the economy on the one hand, and for health, welfare and education 

programs on the other. Honourable Members will note that expenditures on education have been 

increased to 23.32 per cent of the budget, with economic development taking 26.74 per cent, public 

health 19.88 per cent, and social welfare 9.54 per cent of estimated expenditures. I cannot refrain from 

pointing out that interest on public debt now constitutes less than 1.35 per cent of total ordinary and 

capital expenditures, compared with 7.17 per cent ten years ago. 

 

Third, the 1959-60 budget attempts to achieve a balance, in the expenditure of public funds, between 

projects which will be of immediate benefit to the taxpayer, and those the results of which will become 

apparent only in future years. In the field of economic development, for example, we will be spending 

money not only on roads — which result in immediate taxpayer satisfaction — but also on mineral 

surveys, forest management, and scientific research, which will not yield results until sometime in the 

future. In the fields of education, health and welfare, we are making expenditures not only on such 

programs as social aid and hospital insurance, but also on education and cultural affairs where the 

impact is more indirect. 

 

I present this 1959-60 budget to Honourable Members hopeful that they will give it the same rigorous 

scrutiny in reviewing it as the Government has attempted to apply in formulating it. Mr. Speaker, I move 

that you do now leave the Chair.

SECOND READING 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed motion of the Hon. Mr. Fines: 

 

That Bill No. 62 — An Act to assist Interprovincial Steel Corporation Ltd. in establishing a Steel 

Manufacturing Plant in Saskatchewan — be now read a second time. 

 

Mr. A. Loptson (Saltcoats): — Mr. Speaker, I have taken some time in looking over this Bill. To my 

mind it is just a continuation of a principle that was set when a similar Bill was passed in this House in 

aid of the Cement Plant. With this exception, I will admit, that it does not afford the same opportunity 

for the promoters to take a ‘quick buck’ out of it, as was the case in the Cement Plant. 

 

I think that, in all fairness, under an orthodox system we can accept the Plan as being one of common 

practice and I must say it is very unusual and should be incompatible to the principles advanced by a 

socialist government. We observe, in looking it over, that there is some very generous remuneration 

provided for for the promoters. I would say that $200,000 taken out of it for the promotional expenses 

and organization expenses is rather unusual for an organization of this size. This would indicated that 

the promotional shares of 130,000 have been earned by services, and the balance of the $200,000 will be 

taken as remuneration for the organization. 

 

Now there are only one or two reasons why a Corporation has got to come to a government for a 

guarantee of their Bonds. There isn’t a province in the Dominion of Canada where a corporation of a 

similar size has had to go to the government to get them to guarantee their bond issue, or an issue of a 

mortgage, for the purpose of establishing a profitable organization. There are only one or two, or maybe 

part of two, reasons why these people who are promoting this have to get a guarantee from this 

Government — because those who have the money to loan are not prepared to take the risk that is 

attached to industrial loans here. First of all I may say that one reason may be that the proposition is not 

sound. If it is not sound for the private borrower, then it is no m ore sound for the people of 

Saskatchewan, to set their signature as guarantors for the mortgage. I submit, Mr. Speaker, that that is 

one aspect that should be scrutinized. 

 

Now if we are going to assume, as this Prospectus illustrates, that it is a profitable proposition, then 

there should be no reason for these people not being able to borrow money without a guarantee. But I 

think that there is another factor that compels these people to come to the Government for a guarantee, 

and that is the atmosphere of socialization. The atmosphere of ‘red label’ relations with management; 

may people feel that in this Province it is worse than in other provinces to the extent that labour might 

close up this institution or organization by unfair and unreasonable demands of wages. That would 

jeopardize the security of the money that is loaned to establish it; and they feel that as long as the 

Government ahs a debt 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

37 

 

against it, or at least as long as they are obligated to the Government, that risk might be minimized. 

 

On the other hand, those who have bought the shares (I might say most of the share money was made 

out of the profits of the Cement Plant, there is no question about that; the money that these people 

invested in this Steel Plant was the profit that they made out of the Cement Plant) but be that as it may, 

there is no quarrel about that; the fact that they have put their money into shares of this Steel Plant 

would indicate that they expect to get that money back before the Government of Saskatchewan is 

released of their obligation for the money that is loaned in the way of Bonds. 

 

I am just bringing this to your attention because the people of Saskatchewan should know just the kind 

of Government they have here in Saskatchewan and how they are impairing the development of industry 

here. It is time they should know. 

 

Now, here is the Premier of Saskatchewan calling these people ‘quick buck artists’; ‘undesirable 

profiteers’; and then when he finds that these speculators or investors are cooling off he sends the 

Minister of Mineral Resources to the headquarters of the capitalists of Canada and he calls a press 

conference to tell them that there is not going to be any risk of their capital when they come to 

Saskatchewan. That is a funny combination. The Premier condemns everybody that puts any money in 

here, and he sends another Minister to tell them that it is all bunk — what the Premier said — and that 

they are going to be guaranteed a profit. What a combination! What a Government! 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not going to oppose this Bill, although I am opposed to the principle of 

guaranteeing these promotions and the people of Saskatchewan being placed in this position. However, 

they are just as much responsible for this kind of thing as the Government itself, Mr. Speaker. They 

should have never had voted for them. They shouldn’t have put them in here. If there was a Liberal 

government sitting on the other side there wouldn’t be any of this guaranteeing by the Government for 

capital to come into Saskatchewan, any more than there is a guarantee from any other province in this 

Dominion. 

 

But since the situation is as it is and we are anxious to get the industry into this Province I am prepared 

to support this Bill; but I am going t warn this Government; I am going to warn the people of the 

Province of Saskatchewan that if this principle is carried on further it may jeopardize the whole credit of 

this Province, because, after all, there is an element of risk in these things. In spite of the fact that they 

are supposed to make $6 a share profit in the first four years, which is more than the shares have been 

sold for — you talk about profiteering; this Government is condemning everybody else. They talk about 

the Trans-Canada Pipelines because the promoters there got some shares for $8 that went on the market 

at $10. This Government buys a bunch of shares at 60 cents that are going on the market for $6 — that is 

600 per cent. 

 

Hon. Mr. Nollet: — For all the people of the Province. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — That is all right! In other words, if I commit a sin I should be sent to hell, of course, 

but if they commit the 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

38 

sin they should go to heaven. Do as I say, but don’t do as I do! 

 

The element of risk is this — they have to get sufficient raw materials to keep this plant going. They 

have to get enough sales to sell the product. You have to have sufficient profit to make such an industry 

worthwhile. If you don’t allow an organization such as this to make a fair profit when business is good, 

they are not going to come into this Province and they are not going to survive because they are also 

going to run into some slack years. It is only on the optimistic view that this thing can survive. Let us 

hope that what money is put into this venture, belonging to the Province of Saskatchewan, will be 

repaid. I don’t know how the Cement Plant is going; I think it is all right at the present time, but it, too, 

could get into a slump like any other business. 

 

Mr. A. H. McDonald (Leader of the Opposition): — Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in the remarks 

of the Provincial Treasurer (Hon. Mr. Fines) when he introduced this Bill for Second Reading. I was 

amazed to hear the Provincial Treasurer make the remark that this particular Steel Mill would round out 

the industrial empire of Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Speaker, apparently it is the opinion of the Provincial Treasurer and this Government that sits on 

your right that by building the first basic industry in the Province of Saskatchewan they have now 

completed or rounded out our industrial empire. Mr. Speaker, that is utter nonsense. This is the first 

basic industry that has been attracted to the Province of Saskatchewan. I outlined in an earlier debate 

some of the industries that are necessary in Saskatchewan; some of the industries that we must attract 

before we can even think of — let alone talk about — having rounded out our industrial empire. Some 

of those industries have been promised on several occasions. As a matter of fact, no less an individual 

than the Premier himself has announced, on many occasions, that some of these industries were about to 

begin building their plants within Saskatchewan. I can refer to no better example than the numerous 

announcements by the Premier and other members of his Government with respect to a pulp and paper 

industry. This isn’t the rounding out of our industrial empire. This is the beginning — the first spoke; 

and we have all the rest of the spokes to put in; than we will have to set the hub in the middle and put the 

rim on the outside. But according to the Provincial Treasurer, this will complete our industrial empire. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — No, no. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — These are the words of the Provincial Treasurer, and I will quote them to you: 

 

“This will round out an industrial empire.” 

 

Do you know that reminds me of the statement he made when he announced that the Steel Mill would be 

built in Regina — when he said that “Regina would become the Pittsburgh” — now, Mr. Speaker, I 

don’t know whether the Provincial 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

39 

 

Treasurer has ever been to Pittsburgh or not, but if he hasn’t I would suggest that he take a trip down 

there. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — Will you come with me and show me around? 

 

Mr. McDonald: — Yes, I could do that. I know Pittsburgh very well; and if he thinks that the Mill — 

welcome as it is — is going to be any competition to the great steel magnates in Pittsburgh I think he is 

going to be a little bit disappointed. Sure, we are happy to see a Steel Mill come to Regina, or come to 

Saskatchewan, but I sincerely hope that it will have a better effect on our economy than what some of 

the other industries that were given the support of this Province have had. 

 

There is no better example than the Cement Plant, and I can recall when the Provincial Treasurer was 

swaying in his place, when he announced what the Cement Plant would do for Saskatchewan. “Why”, 

he said, “the price of cement in Saskatchewan is away out of line; and if we have a cement industry here 

it will make a great difference to the price of cement to Saskatchewan consumers.” Mr. Speaker, do you 

know that the price of cement in the City of Regina, today, is the highest price of any place on the North 

American continent? Do you know that the price of cement in Regina, today, from supposedly our own 

Cement Plant, is $5.90 a barrel? Do you know what the price of cement is in Winnipeg? It is $3.41 a 

barrel. Do you know what the price of cement is in Edmonton? It is $3.41 a barrel. Do you know what 

the price of cement is in Exshaw, Alberta? It is $2.91 a barrel. So haven’t the consumers of cement had 

tremendous benefits out of the cement industry that was brought to this city? We have enjoyed some 

benefits; because we have a cement industry here we have some 150 or 175 people employed at the 

cement plant, but it hasn’t meant a nickel to the consumer of cement in this city or in this Province. The 

prices of cement throughout the whole of the Province of Saskatchewan are exorbitant, Mr. Speaker. We 

can go to the City of Yorkton; they buy cement even cheaper than it is sold in Regina; they buy their 

cement for $5.37 a barrel. We can go to Weyburn; they buy their cement cheaper than it can be bought 

in Regina; they buy it for $5.58 in Weyburn; or you can go to Estevan and it is $5.58 a barrel there. It is 

$5.82 in Moose Jaw; in Swift Current it is $5.47; it is $5.58 in Saskatoon; it is $5.90 in Prince Albert; 

$5.58 in North Battleford and $5.90 in Regina. The most expensive cement that can be bought on this 

Continent is right here in the City of Regina where we put up $5 1/2 million, or guaranteed the note of 

the bank for $5 1/2 million, to build a cement industry in the City of Regina, to bring cheaper cement to 

our people. 

 

With what result? With the result that we are paying the highest price of any place on this continent. 

 

Now, what is going to happen with the Steel Mill? Is this going to mean that we are to have cheaper 

steel? I don’t think so. I don’t think this is going to interfere too much with Pittsburgh. I would doubt if 

the steel industry in Pittsburgh are too concerned about this mill that is being built in Regina. I doubt 

very much if the price to the consumer will be any less because of a steel industry being built in 

Saskatchewan, or in Regina, than if it wasn’t built. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

40 

I believe that if we are going to bring the maximum benefits of industry to this city and to the Province 

than surely to goodness, by locating an industry here and by taking or pledging the resources of this 

Province, then we can bring cheaper goods to our own people. 

 

It is quite true that upon the announcement of the steel industry another concern, namely Dominion 

Bridge, have decided to come to Regina. I am very p leased to note that that has happened, but you 

know, Mr. Speaker, that the Province of Saskatchewan was the only province in Canada where 

Dominion Bridge haven’t got a plant. Why have they been so long in coming here? 

 

Hon. Mr. Walker (Attorney General): — There was a Liberal government here. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — A Liberal government? According to the Provincial Treasurer we haven’t had 

anything but C.C.F. The Provincial Treasurer, when he introduced this Bill, said it was very difficult to 

raise capital. I agree with him. It is very, very difficult for governments, today, to raise the necessary 

capital, or what can be termed as the necessary capital, to carry on governmental activities — both 

federally and provincially. It is very difficult for private concerns to borrow money today; we all realize 

that; but this Government has made it almost humanly impossible for industry to get finances outside the 

Province of Saskatchewan, in other parts of Canada or the United States. These people must accept their 

fair share of the responsibility for placing industry in the position it is at the moment, as far as borrowing 

money is concerned to be used for the development within the Province of Saskatchewan. No better 

example could be given than the speech of the Premier himself in the Province of Ontario, just a few 

months ago. 

 

How on earth can you expect people with this kind of capital to invest their money in Saskatchewan in 

view of the speeches that the Premier makes — both inside and outside Saskatchewan? Why on earth 

didn’t the Premier go to eastern Canada and make a speech similar to the one that the Premier of 

Manitoba made? 

 

Hon. Mr. Brown (Minister of Travel and Information): — Oh, we’ve heard this before! 

 

Mr. McDonald: — The Premier of Manitoba invited people to come and invest their money in the 

Province of Manitoba; but our Premier has made every effort to destroy the confidence of private 

enterprise in the Province of Saskatchewan. 

 

Hon. Mr. Nollet: — You’re doing a good job of it. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not too concerned about the Provincial Government having 

to back an industry such as this to the tune of $10 million, but I want to again point out that they have 

created a precedent, that in all probability they will have to continue if we are going to attract other 

industries to this Province so that we can complete the wheel and put the rim on it that I spoke about 

earlier. 

 

I hope that we will be able to attract a pulp industry or several pulp industries to Saskatchewan. Now 

when the Provincial Treasurer introduced the legislation to lend money to the Cement Plant>>> 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

41 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — Guaranteed Bonds. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — To guarantee — I am sorry; he said at that time that he hoped we wouldn’t have to 

go above 50 per cent of the value of that plant. Then again, last year, when amendments were made to 

The Crown Corporations Act and the Provincial Treasurer was referring to this particular industry he 

said again that he didn’t expect we would have to go above 50 per cent of the value of this industry; but, 

Mr. Speaker, we have had to go to two-thirds of the value. This mill is going to cost something in the 

neighbourhood of $15 million and the Provincial Treasurer and his Government are backing a note for 

some $10 million at the banks. Well what would that mean if the Province of Saskatchewan carried this 

program through to its ultimate end and were to back future industries that we hope we can attract to this 

Province to the tune of two-thirds of their capitalization? It would mean, Mr. Speaker, that if we are able 

to attract, say three pulp mills, to Saskatchewan, the Provincial Government would have to back their 

notes at the bank to the tune of $100 million. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I am not worried about $10 million — but $100 million is a different thing. If we have to 

back a petro chemical industry and all of the other industries that are needed in Saskatchewan you can 

see where the policy of this Government will lead the Province of Saskatchewan to. I am convinced that 

we must make every effort to attract industry to the Province of Saskatchewan. You can see from the 

sums of money that were referred to, this afternoon, that it is going to be necessary, in the future, for this 

Province to raise even greater sums of money than they have been able to raise over the past few years. 

In order to do that, Mr. Speaker, we must have new sources of income. I had hoped that private 

enterprise would be prepared to invest their millions in Saskatchewan in developing the rich resources 

that we possess, but apparently they are not prepared to do that, so if we have to, because of the 

administration that sits on your right, because of their actions and the lack of confidence in this Province 

to attract industry then I will have to support it, because in my own opinion we must have new sources 

of revenue. 

 

I think that was demonstrated to every member who sat in this Chamber, this afternoon. We cannot 

increase taxes on the taxpayers that we already have. New sources must be found and I hope that private 

investors will again gain confidence in Saskatchewan and that they will come into our Province, put up 

the necessary capital to industrialize this Province so that we will not have to pledge the resources of =f 

in order to get that development. 

 

All I ask is for Saskatchewan to get the same consideration as other provinces of Canada and if that were 

the case a move like this would not be necessary, but it appears that we cannot do it without 

guaranteeing the resources of the Province, without pledging the resources of the Province, and therefore 

I will have to support the Bill. 

 

Premier Douglas: — Mr. Speaker, I wont’ take very much of the time of the House, but I would like to 

make just a few remarks arising from some of the statements which have been made. 

 

I notice my friend addressed the House as ‘Ladies” I can only assume 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

42 

that this is the speech which he makes to the Ladies Liberal Clubs throughout the Province. . . 

 

Mr. McDonald: — I tell the same things in the country that I tell here and that is more than you do. 

 

Premier Douglas: — He not only tells the same things, but he tells things that he has told ten times 

before. 

 

Mr. Cameron (Maple Creek): — At least he is consistent. 

 

Premier Douglas: — The member for Saltcoats (Mr. Lopston) started out by saying that this Bill was 

the same principle as the Cement Bill, in that it was a guarantee, and that was true. He said, however, 

that there was less opportunity here for somebody to make a ‘quick buck’ than there was in the Cement 

deal. I want to point out, however, that so fare as the Cement guarantee is concerned the Province has 

been getting a 2 per cent guarantee fee or 2 per cent of the total amount of the debt outstanding without 

having to put a single dollar out. I don’t think we would have any difficulty at any time in getting rid of 

our guarantee if we wanted to give up that 2 per cent fee. So I don’t think there is any problem there. 

 

The member for Saltcoats also said that he was going to support his Bill because he thought it was 

incompatible with the socialist principles of the members on this side of the House. Mr. Speaker, I prefer 

to look after my own principles rather than have them looked after by someone whom I have not 

considered too much of an authority on that subject. If he will look after his principles I will try to take 

care of my own over here. As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, it is not inconsistent or incompatible with 

out principles. Whereas in the case of the Cement guarantee we got a flat 2 per cent guaranteed fee, 

although we didn’t put up any money; in this case the people of Saskatchewan will get a block of some 

180,000 shares, and as the value of this Plant appreciates, the people will have a permanent equity in 

that industry. It seems to me that that is a very good type of public participation. When you think of the 

figures which the Minister of Mineral Resources (Hon. Mr. Brockelbank) put on the record, the other 

day, of what an investment in General Motors, in 1918 has brought in in the ensuing period. The 

tremendous value of that stock today gives some idea of what it would have meant to the people of the 

United States if they had had an equity in General Motors or in any one of these big corporations. 

 

The member for Saltcoats also said that no other industry had to go to the Government for this kind of 

assistance. I am afraid he is not keeping pace with what is going on in Canada and in the world. First of 

all the Government of Canada quite properly, the last year I was in the House of Commons in 1944, in 

anticipation of the war coming close to an end, brought in The Industrial Development Bank Act, which 

was set up as an adjunct to the Bank of Canada. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — Have any other provinces? 

 

Premier Douglas: — Yes, I am coming to that. Almost all the other provinces have 



 

February 27, 1959

now set up Industrial Development Banks. As a matter of fact, the Province of Newfoundland went 

further than any of them; they not only made loans to companies wanting to start up new industries, but 

even went so far as to build factories, equip them and then lease them to the companies, without them 

having to put in a dollar. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — This is a different proposition. 

 

Premier Douglas: — This isn’t a different proposition at all. They even guaranteed $16 million of 

bonds for one of the companies and most of them were British and American companies. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — Would you say that these people couldn’t borrow this money if it wasn’t for the fact 

that the C.C.F. Government is in power? 

 

Premier Douglas: — I am saying that these people in this Province are no more different — in 

borrowing for industry — than in any other province. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — Our friend, the Provincial Treasurer. . . 

 

Premier Douglas: — The members opposite, particularly the member for Saltcoats, do not want to vote 

for this but they want to damn it with faint praise. He said there are two or three reasons why we have to 

guarantee these bonds. First of all he said: “Maybe it is not sound”. Well that is a good way to encourage 

it; it is a great way to help people put their money into a venture like this — to suggest that it is not 

sound. I remember when we were discussing the Cement Plant, the Federal Minister of Agriculture at 

that time, commenting in the House of Commons, said: “You can never make cement out of that Regina 

clay; it just isn’t suitable.” Well that was certainly designed to help the Cement Plant. Of course, the 

clay has turned out to be excellent clay for cement. But this is one of the ways of my hon. friend when 

they try to be on both sides of the fence. They won’t vote against it but if there is anything they can do to 

pour cold water on it and keep the public from investing in it, to keep investors from supporting it, then, 

of course, this is what is done. 

 

There was no other reason for my friend saying: “Perhaps it is not sound.” The other suggestion he made 

was that companies are hesitant to come in here because of the political atmosphere and because labour 

may up the costs and make such labour demands that it wouldn’t be economical. Well, Mr. Speaker, if 

having a free enterprise government and no labour organization would attract industry to this province 

— and that is what my hon. friend infers — this Province should have had an abundance of industry and 

new investment during the 34 years that there was a Liberal Government in Saskatchewan. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — That’s just bunk; you know. . . 

 

Premier Douglas: — When I was a youngster living in Winnipeg the Dominion Bridge had been 

operating in Winnipeg for over 40 years. Why didn’t they come into Saskatchewan during the Liberal 

regime? 

 

Mr. Loptson: — . . .the Premier of this Province. . . 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

44 

 

Premier Douglas: — If my friend will just keep quiet. If he can just control himself while I try to give 

him some of the facts of life. In the 34 years when there was a Liberal government in Saskatchewan — 

we had iron works and steel works going into Manitoba and into British Columbia. There was no 

socialist government here to keep them out. We had no great amount of Trade Unions. Certainly there 

was no labour legislation that would keep anybody out. I think we had a minimum wage down about as 

low $9.00 a week and I am sure this wouldn’t keep anybody out. The fact of the matter is that there was 

no incentive to come in, because the basic thing that attracts industry wasn’t here. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — Why did you send the Minister of Mineral Resources to Toronto? 

 

Premier Douglas: — I would ask the hon. member to get on his feet and ask his questions properly or 

keep quiet. He had better stop acting like a naughty child. He shouldn’t keep on acting like a juvenile 

delinquent at his age. It isn’t funny any more. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. McDonald) talks about this as the first basic 

industry and he completely distorts the words of the Provincial Treasurer, who talked about this 

rounding out of the picture; buy my hon. friend talks about completing the picture. Now they are quite 

different. If my hon. friend some day gets rounded out, nobody will suggest that he is completed. They 

are not necessarily synonymous terms. This is not the first basic industry in Saskatchewan. I have 

pointed out again and again that in the course of industrial development your basic industries, first of all, 

are those industries which process your primary products, such as oil, cement, clay, brick, potash and 

uranium. Mining of the primary products are your basic industries and until you get these basic 

industries you are not going to get secondary industries and this is a secondary industry. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — It is no such thing. 

 

Premier Douglas: — My hon. friend says it is no such thing. May I point out that I don’t think he 

knows what on earth a basic industry or a secondary industry or a tertiary industry is. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — It’s obvious that you don’t. 

 

Premier Douglas: — If he wants to know what the basic industry in steel is, the basic industry in steel 

is producing pig iron from iron ore. That is the basic industry. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — You ought to know. 

 

Premier Douglas: — Steel is a secondary industry and the fabricating of steel is a tertiary industry. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — You have a piece of it sitting on top of your shoulders. 

 

Premier Douglas: — I will give my friends a little course some day in industrial development. I know it 

would be a waste of time because no matter how much you tell them they still don’t know any more than 

before you started. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

45 

 

The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that we have developed, in the last 10 or 12 years, the basic industries that now 

make it possible to attract secondary industries. The steel industry is a secondary industry. The fact that 

it is attracting now a fabricating, or a tertiary, industry is further indication that this is rounding out the 

picture. 

 

I want to say just one other thing. The Leader of the Opposition talked about this setting a precedent and 

if we had the right kind of government we wouldn’t’ need to set such a precedent. Mr. Speaker, the facts 

speak for themselves. In the last 10 years $750 million has come into this Province to develop oil and 

petroleum resources alone. There has never been anything like it in the history of the Province. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — In spite of you! 

 

Premier Douglas: — If we do it it’s in spite of us — that is characteristic. There has been more public 

and private investment. . . 

 

Mr. Loptson: — You didn’t do it. 

 

Premier Douglas: — . . .in any one year of the last five years than during the last 10 years the Liberals 

were in office. The public and private investment, in 1948, was $241 million; last year it was $626 

million; and still my friends say: “Money won’t come into the Province.” The fact is that money is 

coming into the Province. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — And you propose to eradicate the investors. 

 

Premier Douglas: — My hon. friend talks about setting a precedent and he is worried about the fact that 

we have to keep pledging the credit of the Province; and he talks about three pulp mills. Nobody would 

suggest that we would pledge the credit for three pulp mills. We have made a practice of saying that for 

a new industry, for the first industry coming in, we are prepared to give them some assistance in the 

form of a loan or in the form of a guarantee. When that industry comes in we are convinced that that 

industry will attract other industries, competing either in the same field or attract service industries, or 

secondary, or tertiary industries that will work in conjunction with that industry. 

 

I am not worried at all about setting a precedent. This precedent has been set in other provinces; it has 

been set by the Dominion of Canada; it has been set in this Province in other loans which we have made 

both to private companies and to the Co-operative movement. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I think instead of my hon. friends trying to pour cold water on this and instead of trying to 

belittle it, they ought to be proud of the fact that this is the first Steel Mill of its sort being established in 

western Canada. There is not a Steel Mill of these specifications west of Sault Ste Marie. This could 

make Saskatchewan a very important centre for steel. As I said, on another occasion, if iron ore develops 

in the Province, as we hope it will, this will make it even more important as a factor in our economic 

development. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

46 

Mr. Speaker, I think we ought to be very glad that there are people willing to put their money into this 

and to give their experience and technical know-how to build a steel industry in Saskatchewan. I don’t 

think that those kind of people are very much encouraged by the kind of speeches we have listened to 

this afternoon. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — That’s bunk. 

 

Premier Douglas: — My hon. friends say that it is the Government that keeps industry out, in spite of 

the fact that industry has come in as it has never before. But I certainly would say this. If the Opposition 

keep on making speeches like the ones they have made, this afternoon, it is the public who will think 

that the Opposition are trying to keep them out. The public have ways of dealing with people who are 

trying to hurt the Province. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — You couldn’t tell the truth if. . . 

 

Mr. A. C. Cameron (Maple Creek): — Mr. Speaker, just before the motion is put I would just like to 

make one clarification. 

 

I know the Premier is very adept at taking words of the English language and assigning to them a 

meaning other than that which the speaker meant. I know he is most adept at that. He tried to create a 

great picture because the member for Saltcoats (Mr. Lopston) used the word ‘sound’ — that this 

industry may not turn out to be ‘sound’. He ridiculed it. Being sound, in some layman’s language, I 

presume, is the same as saying there is a risk involved; and the Premier himself said, in introducing this 

legislation, that it may not be sound. In other words, he said ‘there is a risk involved’. 

 

Premier Douglas: — I didn’t introduce the legislation. 

 

Mr. Cameron: — He said “there is a risk involved”; and that is why the Government. . . 

 

Premier Douglas: — Mr. Speaker, on a point of privilege, I didn’t introduce the legislation. 

 

Mr. Cameron: — You didn’t introduce it but you spoke on it. Pardon me, the Provincial Treasurer 

said. . . 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — I never said anything about this not being sound. 

 

Mr. Cameron: — No, you said there is a risk involved — instead of the word ‘risk’ you can apply the 

word ‘sound’; we are not sure whether it is going to materialize or whether it is going to be a great 

industry or not; there is a risk there. It is just a play on words to try to make a story out of something that 

was said. The Provincial Treasurer said: “We are prepared to take part of the risk, because we know 

there is a risk involved in any new enterprise that is being set up.” And a risk is much the same thing as 

soundness; we don’t know; this thing may be very sound; and it may go bankrupt. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

47 

 

It is just a play on words; and he justified why they were purchasing $180,000 worth of shares at 60 

cents, in order that the Government would take part of the risk — 15 per cent of the risk. So there is a 

risk there; — it may turn out that it may not have been too sound a venture; and it may be one of the 

most stable industries that we have, that makes oodles of money. Now it was just a play on words in 

order to create a case against the member, there is no distinction at all. Because if there is no risk 

involved why should the Provincial Treasurer point out that they were taking these shares so that he 

could carry part of the risk. 

 

I think the Minister of Mineral Resources (Hon. Mr. Brockelbank) made the statement that people who 

put up risk capital should receive some prize because of the danger involved. I think this method of 

doing it is probably a change from what you proposed to do in the first place. 

 

The Premier spoke about the Industrial Development Bank in Canada and the Government Development 

Banks in other provinces. We set up similar legislation here. We have an Industrial Development Bank 

in the Province of Saskatchewan. It is called the Industrial Development Board, but we have voted 

money to them each year in order that they can, at their discretion, make loans to encourage industries to 

come in; but I notice, today, in the Estimates just budgeted that a year ago we voted $900,000 to the 

Industrial Development Bank in order that they could encourage industry; last year we reduced that 

figure to $500,000; and this year we are only estimating for $100,000. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — There is a very good reason. 

 

Mr. Cameron: — And we vote to the Industrial Development Board, to encourage industries to come 

into the Province $100,000. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, may I point out that we are not debating the 

budget now but there is a very good reason for this. . . 

 

Mr. Cameron: — That is no point of order. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — Are we going to debate the budget today, or. . . 

 

Mr. McDonald: — We’re not debating the budget. 

 

Mr. Cameron: — We’re not debating the budget at all; we are pointing out a change of emphasis. I am 

pointing out that you are placing the emphasis on a direct guarantee rather than in the method of 

advances to the Development Board or Bank, whereby they would encourage industry and use those 

funds. I just wanted to point those two things out, to keep the record straight. 

 

Hon. Mr. Walker: — It’s really askew now. 

 

Mr. Cameron: — . . . this talk about risk and soundness and so forth; I couldn’t let that go unanswered. 

There are a vast number of words to be found in Webster’s dictionary and even though the meaning may 

be clear there is someone ready to twist and turn them to find a meaning 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

48 

altogether different than what was intended in the mind of the person who was speaking. 

 

Mr. J. R. Barrie (Pelly): — Mr. Speaker, I will take only a few minutes, but I believe there have been 

some amazing revelations taken place in connection with this particular Bill and I wonder at the wisdom 

of a Government who already has, and may in future have, much greater financial commitments than 

they have now, entering into a commitment to a business which we hope will be successful and an asset 

to this Province, but like all businesses there is a great element of risk, particularly in a business that has 

so many competitors and so much competition. 

 

It seems strange to me we would have to go to the extent of guaranteeing two-thirds of the capital 

necessary to establish this business in the Province and the other principals only taking the responsibility 

for raising one-third. It seems the wrong proportion in my mind. There may be reasons for that, but we 

certainly must be very anxious and I believe possibly that is correct — that we should be anxious to 

invite and have industry come into this province, but to have to put up this proportion of the capital or 

guaranteeing this proportion of the capital — over 50 per cent — seems to me a little out of order. 

 

In this particular case the other feature that has struck me is the fact the Government is going into 

accepting or purchasing or going into the matter of playing with stocks and they are going to have 

180,000 shares in this Company; it is hoped it will be a success and will yield dividends. What I find 

amazing is the people that have always talked, over the years, so much about the coupon clippers and 

those people getting dividends should be interested in them now, particularly in this Bill and this 

particular business; associating themselves with a number of millionaires in order to develop and 

establish this business in the Province. It is a very sad state of affairs, in my opinion, when we see 

people who sacrifice principle for some expediency. If these people have changed their principles, 

changed their attitude and changed their thoughts in connection with business and free enterprise, then I 

am very happy about it, but I just cannot understand how they can be so strongly in favour of putting 

over a deal of this kind, obligating the resources and the people of the Province of Saskatchewan; and 

they may have to do it with other industries in the future. I am surprised particularly at the Premier of 

the Province when, about 14 years ago in this Legislature, in the Session of 1945, he is reported to have 

said this, and I quote: “Let none of those who sit in high places lull themselves into security, this 

Government (he is talking of the Government we have today) is pledged to eradicate capitalism in this 

Province and the establishment of a Co-operative Commonwealth; and will do so first or perish in the 

attempt. 

 

Mr. Gardiner: — And now he walks with the millionaires! 

 

Mr. Barrie: — I cannot understand how he can associate himself, today. . . 

 

Premier Douglas: — May I ask my hon. friend a question. Could I ask him to go and finish the 

quotation in which I defined a Co-operative Commonwealth as a partnership of private, co-operative and 

public enterprise. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

49 

 

Mr. Loptson: — Ah, baloney; that was your platform those days. 

 

Mr. Gardiner: — Read the Regina Manifesto. 

 

Mr. Barrie: — I don’t want to take the time to read this, but I think it is very familiar to the people on 

the other side of the House, and as I have understood it, from utterances of members of the Government 

and supporters of the Government, they are still behind this particular document. If that is their principle 

I admire them for it, the same as I have my ideas about things which are opposite to theirs; but that is 

why I say I do not see how they can reconcile themselves in this particular instance — to be going into 

business by putting up a guarantee on the credit of this Province of two-thirds of the amount of money 

required to establish this business. 

 

Mr. Loptson: — Building up millionaires. 

 

Mr. Barrie: — There is something wrong when we have to do that; but I believe, in spite of what has 

been said, there is no citizen of Saskatchewan — inside or outside this House — who doesn’t welcome 

anything in the way of industry or anything else that will be for the betterment of this Province; and 

under these circumstances and in view of the fact that it appears to be very, very urgent and very 

necessary that this Legislature, and the members of this Legislature, pass this Bill in order to get this 

steel industry established in the Province, which I hope will be a success, then if there is some reason for 

that urgency, some reason this has to be done; if it is necessary, in order to bring this steel industry in, 

then, Mr. Speaker, I am quite willing to support the Bill. 

 

Hon. C. M. Fines (closing debate): — Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to say very much but I must answer 

one or two questions. I must answer the statement made by the hon. member from Maple Creek (Mr. 

Cameron) in which he referred to this year’s Estimates that were tabled this afternoon. He pointed out 

that we have only estimated $100,000 for the Industrial Development Fund compared with $500,000 last 

year. May I say that the reason for this reduction is not because we hope to lend less money next year, 

but simply because of the amounts of money which we now have on hand in that fund and in the 

Government Finance Office. If he will examine the report that was tabled — the Industrial Development 

Fund report which was tabled yesterday, and the G.F.O. report which was tabled today — he will find 

that we have on hand $174,000 in the Industrial Development Fund and, of course, we shall be receiving 

repayments, of interest, of roughly $226,000, making $400,000 in the Industrial Development Fund. 

 

In addition to that, the Government Finance Office has only been turning back to the Government 

$800,000 while as we know the surpluses have been much greater than that so during the years there 

have been some very substantial amounts accumulated and if this statement is examined you will find 

that we have on hand — Cash, $759,000; Dominion of Canada Treasury Bills, $496,000; Bank deposit, 

$300,000; Loans to Crown Corporations, $600,000 or over $2 million, which is available for loans. So 

the only reason we put the $100,000 in was to bring this item before the members of the House in order 

that they might discuss it. Actually it is not for the purpose of having the money voted at all. I just want 

to make that clear. It was done for a very logical reason. It just goes to show, Mr. Speaker, that a little 

knowledge is a dangerous thing. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

50 

The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Cement Plant. I would like to make a statement on that. I 

may say that I am not happy either with the fact that these cement prices are being kept as high as they 

are, I am very unhappy about it; however, this is private enterprise and this price system is the way 

private enterprise operates. This is the policy of the oil companies, for example — the Imperial Oil 

Company adopts exactly the same policy. There are people right around Leduc and Redwater in Alberta 

who are very annoyed — here they are right where the oil comes from, right there where they have a big 

refinery; and it makes them awfully peeved and awfully annoyed when they know that, in Regina, you 

can buy a gallon of gasoline cheaper than you can get it in Edmonton. Why? Because of the pricing 

system — a pricing system which is based upon the competitive price of anybody else bringing oil in. 

Now the oil that is in competition with the oil from Edmonton would be the oil from Wyoming and it 

costs less in Regina for that oil than it does in Edmonton; therefore, they charge more in Edmonton. It 

seems silly, I know, but that is private enterprise. That is the way they operate. 

 

The same is true with the steel industry. . . 

 

Mr. McCarthy (Cannington): — It is the same with the brick. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — We find the very same thing with the steel industry so the Cement Corporation is 

not doing anything that is not done in other industries. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — May I ask the Minister a question? 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — Yes, if I can answer it. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — Is this the same policy that is adopted by the Crown Corporation that handles brick? 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — I don’t think so. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — It certainly is. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — I think that you can buy brick, for instance, in Estevan more cheaply than you can 

get it in Regina. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — You can buy it cheaper in Winnipeg than you can in Estevan. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — I don’t know; I am not really too well up to date; I say. . . 

 

Mr. McDonald: — We know that. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — You see, Mr. Speaker, there is a little difference. . . 

 

Mrs. Batten: — Mr. Speaker, will the hon. member allow a question? 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — If it is a good question, yes. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

51 

 

Mrs. Batten: — I am sure it is a good question. Was the Hon. Provincial Treasurer aware of this vicious 

pricing system when he introduced the Bill with regard to the Cement Plant? Didn’t he promise that we 

would have lower prices? 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — Oh, definitely. Mr. Speaker, the economics of the Cement Plant were based upon 

that. This Cement Plant, I may say, is a high cost plant; probably the highest cost per barrel producing 

cement of any plant on the North American continent. When you stop to realize that you have to bring 

your principal product all the way from Mafeking in Manitoba and when you consider that this Plant 

was built only two or three years ago at a time when prices were very, very high. The Plant in Alberta, at 

Exshaw, is right there situated where they have an abundance of cheap power from the power sources in 

the mountains; right there where they have the raw product right at hand — a plant that was built 25 

years ago at a price which would be worth — at least our dollar would be worth about 40 cents in 

relation to the dollar of that time. In other words, it would cost, today, about $2.50 for every dollar that 

they invested; and, of course, it has been written off. The same is true of the plant at Fort White in 

Manitoba. I was born and brought up there and at the time when I was a youngster I remember that 

plant; it was an old, old plant, built at a time when money was very cheap — or, if I put it the other way, 

at a time when the dollar would buy a great deal more than it does today. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, I mention this to point out that it is not the Government that is fixing this price. It is 

true that we still have a guarantee there, but I would like to tell the House it was only yesterday that I 

wrote a letter to the Presided of the Inland Cement Corporation of Montreal, with a copy to the Vice-

President in Edmonton, and a copy to the local manager, pointing out this injustice and urging that 

something be done about it. 

 

Now, Mr. Speaker, I feel that the time has come when we probably should try and get the Company to 

change its policy in this respect, but I would point out — that this Company, three years ago, was not in 

a position that it could afford to cut its prices too low, because if they did, immediately the Canada 

Cement Company would come in from both sides and would ship their cement in here and sell it at a 

price of say $1.00 less, take the business and, of course, then there is a price war. Here you have a small 

company with expensive operation costs trying to compete against another. It is a pretty serious and 

difficult problem. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — Would the Minister answer another question? Do you know what the profits of 

Inland Cement in Canada were last year and the percentage of that total profit? 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — No, I don’t know the total profits, but I do know the profits for this Plant, and I 

know it is less than $1.00 a barrel. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — . . .pretty good. . . 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — I agree. Nevertheless, I do think they are entitled to some return. 



 

February 27, 1959 

 

 

52 

Mr. McDonald: — Just a million dollars worth, that’s all. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — A million dollars is what they got for profits — roughly $1 million. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — On an investment of $8 1/2 million. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — The Inland paid approximately $12 million. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — With depreciation? It would run about $8 million. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — No, they paid roughly $12 million at the time the transaction was made. 

 

Mr. McDonald: — That’s when your friends made all their money. 

 

Hon. Mr. Fines: — Now, Mr. Speaker, I only wanted to deal with those two things — the matter of the 

pricing policy and the Cement Corporation — to point out that this is a matter where private enterprise 

has declined, in its wisdom, the policy to be adopted; and it is following the pricing policy of oil and the 

pricing policy of steel. It is not unique. I also want to emphasize again, Mr. Speaker, that we are not 

trying to cut down on the total amount of money spent for Industrial Development in the next year. 

 

I would like, also, Mr. Speaker, to thank the members of the Opposition for their support of this Bill. I 

think that this very generously given support from the Opposition means that we can all look forward to 

this industry going ahead, and as I pointed out, in introducing it, the rounding out of this particular 

industry. I should probably not have used that term because I think there is one other phase and that is 

the development of an Iron Mill which will come, no doubt, some day just as soon as we find the raw 

ore in sufficient quantity to justify the construction of such a plant. When we do then we will have a 

thoroughly integrated steel industry in this Province and I believe that this is just going to be the 

forerunner to many other mills in the future. 

 

The question being put, it was agreed unanimously, and the Bill referred to a Committee of the Whole at 

next sitting. 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed motion of the Hon. Mr. Walker: 

 

That Bill No. 18 — An Act to amend The Fair Employment Practices Act, 1956 — be now read the 

second time. 

 

Mrs. Mary J. Batten (Humboldt): — Mr. Speaker, I have some questions which cannot be asked of 

the Attorney General on this Bill at this time; and I am quite willing to let this stand over until we 

discuss the matter in Committee. 

 

The question being put, it was agreed to and the Bill referred to a Committee of the Whole at next 

sitting. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 5:30 o’clock p.m.
