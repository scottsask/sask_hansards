ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I'm happy today to 
present petitions on behalf of the people from the Pennant and 
Gull Lake areas of south-west Saskatchewan. I'll read the 
prayer: 
 
 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to allocate adequate funding 
dedicated towards the double-laning of Highway No. 1; 
and further, that the Government of Saskatchewan direct 
any monies available from the federal infrastructure 
program towards double-laning Highway No. 1 rather 
than allocating these funds towards capital construction 
projections in the province. 

 
 And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 
 
I'm happy to table these on behalf of the people of 
Saskatchewan today, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. D'Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too have 
petitions to present today. The petitions read: 
 
 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your Hon. 

Assembly may be pleased to unequivocally oppose 
changes to present legislation regarding firearm 
ownership, and instead urge the federal government to 
deal with the criminal use of firearms by imposing 
stiffer penalties on abusers, and urge the federal 
government to recognize that gun control and crime 
control are not synonymous. 

 
 And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 
 
These petitions come from the Yellow Creek, Saskatoon, St. 
Brieux, Fort McMurray, Prince Albert, Melfort area, Saskatoon, 
Rockglen, Mr. Speaker; Fife Lake, Sintaluta, Indian Head, 
Marquis, Eyebrow. From across the province, Mr. Speaker. I so 
present today.

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 
Hon. Mr. Wiens: — It is my pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to 
introduce four guests from Jilin province from the People's 
Republic of China. I would ask them to rise and be recognized. 
Mr. Yanlin Wang, the chief engineer of Fisheries Research 
Institute, division of Aquatic Products, Jilin provincial  



April 27, 1995 

 
1806 

Department of Water Conservancy; Mr. Tingfu Ben, director 
and engineer, Antu Reservoir; Mr. De Yi Yu, vice-director of 
the Ice Festival office, Jilin City; and Mr. Cheng Dong, 
interpreter from the Foreign Affairs office. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say that it was my privilege to visit the 
province of Jilin in 1981 and was treated with the greatest of 
hospitality at that time, including a wonderful banquet put on 
by the province. And we have the opportunity to reciprocate in 
hosting this delegation from Jilin now. 
 
As you know, Saskatchewan has been twinned with Jilin 
Province since 1984. Five two-year action plans have been 
negotiated between the two provinces, the latest by the Hon. 
Ed. Tchorzewski in Jilin in June, 1994, that contain schedules 
of exchanges and cooperative projects. 
 
Last year was the 10th anniversary of this relationship and 
celebrations were held in Jilin during Mr. Tchorzewski's visit. I 
invited this delegation here as part of the fifth plan of action, 
the purpose being the fisheries cooperation in the fish species 
transfer project, to learn about the culture techniques and 
fisheries management of walleye and other fish species in 
Saskatchewan, to receive 1 million walleye eggs from 
Saskatchewan, and to discuss further details on further fisheries 
cooperation between the two provinces. 
 
The delegation will also be meeting with you later on to deliver 
a letter from his counterpart on the Standing Committee of the 
People's Congress in Jilin, and we look forward to a growing 
and strengthening relationship with our colleagues from the 
People's Republic of China. Welcome. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Lorje: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to join 
with the minister in welcoming our guests from Jilin province. 
In 1987, as a representative of the Jeux Canada Games, I was 
privileged to go to Jilin and to attend the 1987 All-China 
Winter Games. 
 
Although this was shortly after my husband had just passed 
away and it was a time of great sadness for me, it was also a 
period of great joy to see the Chinese people organizing this 
splendid sporting event and to participate in their excellent 
hospitality. 
 
So I thank you and all the people who were involved in the trip 
at the time and I wish you the best of times in Saskatchewan 
during your stay here. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to 
introduce some students, but before that I want to also extend a 
welcome to our friends from Jilin. 
 
I was fortunate and had the honour of being in Jilin in the 
month of June and signed the fifth plan of action on behalf of  

the province of Saskatchewan. And it's so good to have these 
representatives here today to visit our province and to visit 
Canada, because the relationship between Canada and the 
People's Republic of China has been a wonderful one to the 
mutual benefit of both Canada and to the People's Republic of 
China. 
 
Also, Mr. Speaker, I want to bring to your attention and to the 
attention of the House, a group of grades 7 and 8 students who 
are here from Regina Dewdney constituency from the Glen Elm 
School. They are accompanied here by their teacher, Liane 
Schultz, and I want to extend to them a warm welcome. 
 
I hope that they enjoy their stay here today. I'm looking forward 
to meeting with them at 2:45 to have some refreshments and to 
answer all those hard questions which I know they always have 
— usually which makes the questions that are asked in here 
quite easy to handle, considering that. 
 
So welcome, and I ask members of the House to join me in 
extending a warm welcome to the students from Glen Elm 
School. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Flavel: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
introduce to you and through you to members of the Legislative 
Assembly, someone seated in your gallery. My son Jeff is 
seated there today — he's just finished writing his tests at the 
University of Saskatchewan and has come home to spend a 
couple of weeks relaxing in the cab of a tractor, I hope. So I 
want all members to please welcome him here this afternoon. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to join 
in welcoming the members from Jilin province. I was a member 
of Regina City Council when we were able to sign a twinning 
agreement with Jinan and was able to meet with the mayor of 
Jinan on a few occasions. And I'd like to say a warm welcome 
and extend my greetings. 
 
I would like to introduce also to you and through you to all 
members of the Assembly, a constituent and a friend who's 
seated in your gallery, Mr. Speaker, Norm Huber. Norm and his 
wife Jenny have had a small business in the constituency for a 
number of years. And I'd ask all members to join with me in 
welcoming him here today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Hagel: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. It is my pleasure to 
introduce to you, and through you to all members of the 
Assembly, Alison Gordon who is visiting us from Ontario. 
Members may recognize Alison's name, with the baseball 
season just having begun, because she is a former sports 
reporter for The Toronto Star, who was the first woman reporter 
to cover a major league team, following the Toronto Blue Jays, 
I believe, for five years. 



April 27, 1995 

 
1807 

Out of that experience, Ms. Gordon has authored four mystery 
novels whose heroine, Kate Henry, happens to be a reporter 
covering a major league baseball team based in Toronto, Mr. 
Speaker. Her latest novel is entitled Striking Out and has just 
been published. And by the way, Kate Henry lives in Toronto 
but is from Saskatchewan. 
 
Of interest to members of this Assembly is the fact that Ms. 
Gordon's father, John King Gordon, was a diplomat for the 
United Nations and one of the authors of the Regina Manifesto. 
 
She is accompanied today by two famous Saskatchewan authors 
as well. With her is Governor General Award winner Maggie 
Siggins, who has done her bit to make this Assembly 
well-known, and also Gail Bowen, who has in fact killed off a 
couple of fictitious members of this Assembly. And I'll ask all 
members to extend their warm welcome to these three Canadian 
authors that we're very proud to have with us today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Lorje: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. While we're welcoming 
these distinguished authors, I think we also should welcome 
Ted Bowen, Gail Bowen's chauffeur. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Rolfes: — I'm sure this group was wondering if 
they'd ever be introduced today, but I will do that honour today. 
I'd like to introduce to the Legislative Assembly a group from 
John Lake School, which is in my constituency. We have 20 
grade 8 students here today, sitting in the Speaker's gallery. 
They are accompanied by their teachers, Brad Moser, Janice 
Walker-Szaroz, Dan Kilback; and chaperons, Bonnie Davies, 
and Aretha Levay. 
 
I will be meeting with them, hopefully, later on to have any 
questions that you may have, and try and answer them for you. 
And I've asked my colleague from the neighbouring 
constituency to accompany me for the question and answer, so 
he can answer the most difficult questions. I ask all members to 
please welcome the John Lake School here today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Pringle: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
would like to join you in welcoming the students and the 
teachers and the drivers here today. Some of you live in my 
constituency as well, so I will be honoured to join with the 
Speaker and you after question period. So have a nice day in 
Regina and a safe trip home. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 
would like to join with you and colleagues in the House in 
welcoming all of these people from John Lake School. I had a 
great, great time when I taught in John Lake School. In fact it 
was many years ago, but I established all the self-contained  

learning disability classrooms in the city of Saskatoon, and one 
of the first, in fact  indeed the first  was at John Lake 
School. So it's very, very nice to see people here from 
Saskatoon and in particular John Lake today. 
 
Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 

Increase in Gasoline Prices 
 
Mr. Trew: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, today I'm 
mad as heck. Today many Regina motorists are also mad as 
heck, and we're not going to take it any more. Gasoline prices 
have increased by 3 cents a litre overnight; they're now at 
sixty-one and a half cents a litre at many Regina gas stations. 
 
We're told the price of gas is going up right across North 
America, but it's coming at a time when we can least afford it. 
Farmers are getting ready to put the crop in the ground; they're 
going to need fuel. The rest of us are busy paying our income 
taxes these days. 
 
There's been a lot of reasons suggested why the price of gas has 
been going up — gouging by the energy companies, rising 
crude oil prices, market forces are to blame, a cash grab by the 
oil companies is to blame, and the recent federal budget. I'm 
quick to point out it's been over two years since the provincial 
gas tax went up one anything. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the search for an answer began some time back 
when my Member of Parliament, John Solomon, called for a 
federal inquiry into this mess. Yesterday he again urged the 
federal government to act on his request immediately. Everyone 
agrees that an inquiry should be held sooner rather than later, 
and it seems so strange that prices keep going up five times in 
the recent eight or nine months. 
 
Mr. Speaker, let's support my member, John Solomon, in his 
call for a federal price inquiry into the price of gas. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Holocaust Remembrance Day 
 
Ms. Lorje: — On a sad note, Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago allied 
troops began liberating the Nazi death camps. The rest of the 
world suddenly realized that what it had suspected, but refused 
to believe, was in fact the truth. 
 
In the 20th century we learned that a civilized people could, as a 
matter of national policy, dedicate itself to the extermination of 
another people. Fifty years later, we are still trying to 
understand how this happened. 
 
Today is Yom ha-Sho'ah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is a 
day set aside for the solemn remembrance of the 6 million Jews 
who were the victims of the Holocaust. We still cling to the 
hope, Mr. Speaker, that if we do not forget, we can prevent a  



April 27, 1995 

 
1808 

return to this most wicked expression of our often dark century. 
 
For those who argue that we should let the past fade away, that 
the time has come to forget ancient history, all we need to do is 
look about us. The daily news reminds us that these evil human 
impulses are still within us. The evidence is in Rwanda, in 
Bosnia, in Oklahoma, and maybe even in the land of Anne of 
Green Gables. 
 
So in remembering the Holocaust, we are engaged in much 
more than an observance of bad times past. We are reminding 
ourselves that it is the duty of each nation, each province, each 
individual, and particularly each legislator, to work against that 
part of our nature which invites racism, intolerance, and 
violence. Shalom. Walk in peace. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

YWCA's Women of Distinction Awards Dinner 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Last night at the 
Centre of the Arts, the Regina YWCA held its 13th annual 
Women of Distinction Awards dinner. As the member from 
Saskatoon River Heights said a few weeks ago, this is one of 
three such dinners held in the province to pay tribute to women 
who have made a difference to their community and their 
province. 
 
The Regina awards dinner was a success in many ways. First it 
was a triumph of organization. Six hundred guests were fed, 
entertained, and nominees were fêted, all in the allotted time. I 
can think of at least one other gender that might have trouble 
matching that. And because of the organization and the 
numbers, more than $40,000 was raised for the Y and its 
valuable services, including the Isabel Johnson Shelter for 
battered women. 
 
Finally, 18 remarkable women were nominated and six were 
given Women of Distinction Awards. 
 
Ninety seconds is not enough time to do more than name them, 
Mr. Speaker. In the arts and culture category, the award went to 
Susan Ferley of the Globe Theatre. Gaye Burgess won the 
business and professional award. Beverley Davison Butt was 
recognized for community and humanitarian service. Sharon 
Armstrong, mayor of Wynyard, was recognized for her 
contribution to rural community. Dr. Joan Baldwin was given 
the wellness award. And Barb Krause was the young woman of 
distinction. 
 
I congratulate all nominees, the winners, and the Regina 
YWCA. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 

Rafferty-Alameda Dams 
 
Mr. D'Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Recently the 
member from Indian Head-Wolseley stated that the purpose of 
the Alameda dam was to, quote, provide water for the 
Americans when they needed it. Hansard, April 4. 

In actual fact, Mr. Speaker, I would like to know where the 
member thought the water was going before the dam was built. 
And as most water does, 100 per cent of this precious resource 
used to flow into the United States for free. With the dam, 
Saskatchewan retains 50 per cent of the resource for our own 
use. We now have the ability to save water; as well, provide 
flood protection for Canadians and Americans — the same 
Americans which the member thought were receiving an unfair 
share of the water. 
 
Today's headline in the Star-Phoenix reads, "Rafferty, Alameda 
prevent (North Dakota) flood." It goes on, Mr. Speaker, to read: 
 
 It may be flooding in east central Saskatchewan, but 

down in the southeast corner, much of the runoff is 
being collected behind the Rafferty and Alameda dams. 

 
As the MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly) for this 
area, I can vouch for the fact that Rafferty-Alameda has 
prevented flooding at Beaver Park in Oxbow. 
 
Further, Mr. Speaker, the article states that Rafferty is presently 
30 per cent full and the reservoir behind the Alameda dam is 
one-third full as well. In addition, it states that this dam would 
be holding even more water at the present time if not for the 
NDP's (New Democratic Party) agreement with the Tetzlaff 
brothers. 
 
Mr. Dalvin Euteneier of Sask Water comments that Minot, 
North Dakota would have been flooded this spring if it had not 
been for the dams. Mr. Speaker, Rafferty-Alameda provides 
cooling water for the Shand power station, flood protection for 
both Canadians and Americans, as well as much needed 
recreational tourism opportunities in the south-east. It's time the 
members . . . 
 
The Speaker: — I'm sorry, but the member's time has elapsed. 
 

40th Anniversary of St. Walburg Elks 
 
Mr. Sonntag: — Mr. Speaker, usually when we think of elk we 
think of animals that roam our parkland in Saskatchewan, but in 
St. Walburg recently a number of Elks of the human variety 
were honoured. I am talking about the 40th anniversary of St. 
Walburg Elks, No. 389, which I had the pleasure of attending 
on Saturday, April 22. 
 
The St. Walburg Elks have had a huge impact on the 
community over the last 40 years. They have donated over $1.2 
million to various projects and worthwhile causes over these 
four decades. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize three individuals 
who were original members of the St. Walburg's Elks in 1955. 
They are Paul Novlan, Nick Kujawa, and Cliff Knight. They 
were presented with beautiful prints at the anniversary banquet 
for their service in the Elks organization. 
 
The St. Walburg Elks are also doing a wonderful job of  



April 27, 1995 

 
1809 

organizing their own financial affairs. At the same function, 
they held a mortgage-burning ceremony to show that their 
mortgage has been paid off in full. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the St. Walburg Elks 
for their contribution to the community of St. Walburg over the 
past 40 years and offer my best wishes for their future. Thank 
you very much. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Flooding in Saltcoats 
 
Mr. Knezacek: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I want to comment 
on the flood situation as it pertains to the Saltcoats 
constituency. During the last week constituents of Saltcoats and 
other eastern Saskatchewan communities have been faced with 
a serious flood situation — a nightmare for many. 
 
We've had many roads and culverts washed out, highways with 
water flowing over them, roads opened or cut to allow water to 
flow in order to minimize the water damage in several 
communities, and a lot of personal property damage on many 
farms and within the communities of Langenburg and MacNutt 
due to the unusual flood situation. The farm communities 
around Kamsack and along the Assiniboine River basin have 
been particularly hard hit. 
 
I have personally witnessed the sights I have described to you 
and have been in contact with the affected municipal reeves, 
mayors, and councillors, and many residents. All residents and 
local governments have once again displayed an excellent 
display of volunteerism and a spirit of cooperation in order to 
assist in attempting to minimize the effects of the flood on their 
residents and their properties. 
 
Local residents in Langenburg and Churchbridge took charge of 
the situation last weekend, many working around the clock, and 
others were on a call basis night and day. All residents helped 
where they could, whether it was through filling sandbags, 
providing lunch, making coffee, monitoring the water level, 
providing pumping equipment, evacuating residents, or simply 
helping where needed. 
 
I want to commend all the people who worked together and 
supported one another in this time of need. Your cooperative 
spirit in helping one another makes my heart swell with pride. 
Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — Before we proceed to oral questions, I want to 
remind members, under the third report of the Special 
Committee on Rules and Procedures of the Legislative 
Assembly, under Statements by Members, 9.1(4): 
 
 Statements are not debatable and are not responded to 

by any other Member. 
 

I hope members will keep this in mind in the future when they 
make statements by members. 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 

Balanced Budget Legislation 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 
questions this afternoon are for the Minister of Finance. It 
appears that everybody has a copy of the government's so-called 
balanced budget legislation except for this Assembly. And 
while we eagerly await what will likely be the greatest flop of 
this session, we have a number of questions for you, Madam 
Minister. 
 
Madam Minister, over the past three and a half years your 
government unleashed an unprecedented tax attack on 
Saskatchewan families, such that Saskatchewan people now 
spend over half of their working year paying taxes and utilities. 
Over half of the year, Madam Minister. 
 
Can you tell us how your Bill is going to protect the taxpayer 
from this kind of tax grab, and whether Saskatchewan people 
will be empowered to have a direct say in any future tax 
increases? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Speaker, thank you very much 
for that question. Of course I can't talk about the specifics, but 
let me talk generally about our approach. 
 
This government brought in the first balanced budget in this 
province in more than 13 years — the first balanced budget in 
Canada. Along with that budget we presented our financial plan 
for the next four years in this province. And what the members 
will notice, that in that plan there are no tax increases. In fact 
there are tax cuts beginning, effective July 1 this year. So what 
they could expect in the next four years is not tax increases, but 
tax cuts. 
 
But I will say this to the member opposite. Before we decided 
on balanced budget legislation, we did extensive research into 
jurisdictions that actually have balanced budget legislation, 
mostly American states. 
 
And what I'm going to table in the legislature today is a table 
showing that the jurisdictions that had balanced budget 
legislation, the states relative to the Canadian provinces, had 
debts that increased more dramatically than the debts of the 
Canadian provinces. 
 
And what I'm going to suggest to you is this: why did they have 
legislation that essentially didn't work? Two reasons. One, 
loopholes. The other reason was this: they were like the 
members opposite. We're going to have tough, mean, miserable, 
balanced budget legislation. The government can't do this and 
the government can't do that. And all of a sudden they realize 
that the government can't continue to operate schools beyond  



April 27, 1995 

 
1810 

April because they've run out of money. 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. Next question. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Madam Minister, you 
speak of loopholes. And we'll certainly be watching your 
legislation to see what kind of loopholes it has in it. You've 
confirmed in the newspaper that it's going to contain some 
things that no other jurisdiction has. How very true. Your Bill 
likely will contain absolutely no protection against the heavy 
hand of government soaking every last penny out of the 
hard-earned wages of the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
And the Saskatchewan taxpayers' association said in a news 
release yesterday, and I quote: 
 
 "A balanced budget law without the proper use of 

accounting, without (the) proper protection from tax 
hikes, without penalties for politicians who break the 
law and without a debt-elimination plan (is worth little 
more than) the paper it's written on." 

 
Given your statements, Madam Minister, in the media, I fear 
and the taxpayers of Saskatchewan fear that this legislation will 
be useless. Can you give your pledge that this legislation will be 
little more than a cruel joke on the people of Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Speaker, I must admit, to have 
the Tory Party talking to this government about balanced budget 
legislation is like the disease prescribing the cure. But he also 
mentions the Association of Saskatchewan Taxpayers — and 
normally I wouldn't get into speaking about groups in this 
legislature — they mention it. 
 
Where was the Association of Saskatchewan Taxpayers in the 
1980s when over a billion dollars a year was being racked up in 
this province's debt? I can tell you, the leader of that group was 
working for that party. She was part of the group that added 
about a billion dollars a year to the debt of this province. 
 
What I can assure the members opposite is this. We balanced 
the books of the province, and we did it the Saskatchewan way. 
We've begun to pay down the debt and give tax relief to 
families, and we did it the Saskatchewan way. We will bring in 
balanced budget legislation, and we will do it the Saskatchewan 
way. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Madam Minister, you 
balanced the budget the NDP way, by taxing more and more 
and more on the people of this province. That's how you 
accomplished it, Madam Minister, and that's what the people of 
Saskatchewan are saying to you all across this province today. 
 

Madam Minister, I have a copy of An Act respecting the 
Protection of Saskatchewan Taxpayers that we introduced 
earlier in this session. It contains all of the elements of balanced 
budget legislation, with teeth, Madam Minister, taxpayers' teeth. 
It's designed to protect people from government, instead of 
protecting . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. I will ask members to please 
quit shouting across the floor. The member has a right to ask his 
question without too much interruption by other members. 
Would the member please put his question. 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Our legislation is 
designed to protect people from the government, instead of 
protecting government from the people. It's time to start 
restraining government, Madam Minister, instead of the 
taxpayers. 
 
Compared to your legislation, which is little more than a 
popgun, this is a howitzer, Madam Minister, and it's what your 
own polling is telling the government on that side of the House. 
Madam Minister, if you are so confident in your government's 
ability to manage and balance budgets, why not implement this 
piece of legislation and throw yours where it belongs  in the 
garbage can, Madam Minister. 
 
You shouldn't fear the taxpayers . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. I think the member has gone on 
quite a length of time. He has to ask a question. Would the 
member please put his question. Order. Would the member 
please ask his question. 
 
Mr. Boyd: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Madam Minister, you 
shouldn't fear the taxpayers. Will you do what you should do in 
the legislature this afternoon — introduce a real piece of 
balanced budget legislation, like The Protection of 
Saskatchewan Taxpayers Act. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Speaker, I would say to the 
member opposite, if what they proposed has teeth, it's because 
it's going to bite the taxpayers and the people of this province. 
 
The members opposite have to have some consistency and have 
to at least strive at some credibility. They have said in their 
legislation they're going to reduce the debt, eliminate the debt in 
25 years — $500 million a year in new cuts to do that. 
 
They've also said they're going to reduce the sales tax. They're 
going to reduce the income tax — $180 million new cuts 
required  $680 million. They've also said they're going to cut 
government spending by 5 per cent, which will get them about 
$250 million. They're $400 million short. The Tory Party still 
can't add. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear!

Gasoline Price Increases 
 
Mr. D'Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
gasoline prices have now jumped to 60 cents a litre across 
Saskatchewan. And while people like John Solomon are quick 
to attack the oil companies, governments share at least as much 
responsibility for the high price of gasoline in Saskatchewan. 
 
Nearly half the price of gas is federal and provincial taxation. In 
fact if the oil companies were giving gas away for free, we 
would still be paying 28.7 cents a litre or nearly $1.30 a gallon 
in taxes. Saskatchewan drivers pay 15 cents a litre in provincial 
taxes alone, the highest in Western Canada. 
 
My question is to the Minister of Finance. Do you agree that the 
government should shoulder much of the blame for the high 
price of gas and what plans do you have to lower the gas tax in 
Saskatchewan? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Anguish: — I thank the hon. member for his 
question. The hon. member should know full well that the price 
of gas is market driven, and I don't think you should be blaming 
John Solomon, who's done a very good job in terms of calling 
on the federal government to look into the issue of gasoline 
prices. 
 
And I point out to you also that the member who made a 
statement earlier today . . . is that the Saskatchewan tax on 
gasoline has not been increased in excess of two years. We'll 
remember the days when, as an election promise, some of those 
members opposite sat in a government that removed the 
gasoline tax completely. It won them votes in one election, but 
it drove Saskatchewan $15 billion into debt. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. D'Autremont: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The member 
keeps forgetting that a good portion of that debt, over $5 
billion, was in place in 1982 when the NDP were defeated. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about market driven. Mr. 
Speaker, in Saskatchewan it's tax driven. Let's have a 
made-in-Saskatchewan solution for the gasoline tax. I 
understand the Minister of Justice can't do that with guns, but 
let's do it with gasoline here. Lower the taxes here, Mr. 
Minister. 
 
Mr. Minister, if you don't plan on lowering the gas tax, would 
you at least like to legislate a guarantee that you don't plan on 
raising it any more in the future. You said that you haven't 
raised it in two years, but you announced it two years ago and it 
took place this year. 
 
You could have given that guarantee in your balanced budget 
legislation by making it illegal to raise taxes, but you haven't 
done that because you want to leave the door open for future 
increases. 

Mr. Minister, why don't you have a legislated tax freeze in this 
legislature to protect consumers from future tax increases to gas 
tax and other provincial taxes? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Anguish: — I don't think the member is thinking 
very rapidly on his feet, Mr. Speaker. If you'll recall back, it's 
that group of people over there who caused negative things to 
happen with Saskatchewan's economy and the Saskatchewan 
budget. 
 
If you'd follow what's happened over the last years in this 
legislature, since this administration came into office, we've 
finally come to a point that we have a balanced budget in 
Saskatchewan and we've started . . . it's not much, but we 
started to reduce the tax load on the citizens of the province of 
Saskatchewan. 
 
That's a projection that we plan on continuing. It's a 
commitment by this government and the Minister of Finance, 
it's been laid out in the financial plans of the province, and I 
think you should do a little homework and come up with some 
questions that would be of greater concern. At least show some 
logic on your part; your questions defy logic to the people of 
the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Balanced Budget Legislation 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, this government has made its own bed when it comes 
to keeping promises and honouring contracts, and the balanced 
budget legislation has not even been introduced and already 
people are expressing cynicism about how this government can 
be trusted to honour any contract or commitment. 
 
This government has a track record of tearing up contracts with 
business people, with farmers, and is very well-known for its 
retroactive changes to legislation. The actions of the 
government speak far, far louder than their words or their words 
on paper. 
 
My question is directed to the Minister of Finance: Madam 
Minister, people don't trust anything that is legislated by your 
government because they're not quite sure that it'll come to 
fruition because you change laws to suit your political purposes. 
What guarantee will people have that you're going to abide by 
the legislation that you bring forward today? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — I thank the member opposite for the 
question. Mr. Speaker, this government promised to balance the 
books of the province. This government delivered on that 
promise. This government promised to begin to reduce taxes 
once we balanced the books of the province. We've delivered 
on that promise. This government has promised to reduce the  



April 27, 1995 

 
1812 

debt of the province. We put forward a plan to do that, and 
we've begun to reduce the debt of this province. 
 
I'm astonished to hear the member opposite say the electorate 
does not trust this government. We have a record. We have 
plans that we have put in place and we have delivered on them. 
 
What I say to the member opposite is, when has she ever put 
before the people of this province a plan to solve any problem, 
never mind the major financial problems that this province has 
faced. 
 
We have balanced the books of this province. We will bring in 
legislation that will be effective, and we will ask the people of 
the province who they trust to manage their finances. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It is 
indeed interesting to note that these are the people whose leader 
ended up saying, at midnight tonight the PST (provincial sales 
tax) will be gone. The same man in fact who as leader of the 
opposition said, under no circumstances if he were premier of 
the province . . . there would never be any casino in the 
province of Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, everybody knows that this government has relied 
on unsustainable windfalls and high taxes to balance their 
budget. And today they're going to introduce a law which will 
supposedly keep the books balanced. Now nobody can legislate 
good luck, Mr. Speaker, but the NDP sure knows how to 
legislate high taxes. 
 
My question to the Finance minister: will you indeed — which 
you did not answer earlier — give a commitment that your 
legislation will offer protection to the taxpayers against your 
government's tax and spend policies; a commitment, Madam 
Minister, to actually reduce the costs of government in order to 
hold the line on taxes? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Speaker, the member opposite 
makes statements which are not accurate about what our 
Premier said and did. But she has opened herself up to an 
examination of her own record. How can a leader that stood in 
this legislature in the last session and added $300 million to the 
deficit, talk about balancing the books? How can a leader that 
has promised already four tax cuts without telling the people 
where the money's coming from, stand in this legislature and 
talk about balancing the books? 
 
We have balanced the books of this province. We have laid 
before the people our plan for their future. It includes tax cuts. 
 
But I'll say to the member opposite, we are not going to 
Americanize politics in Saskatchewan. We are not going to 
have budgets by referendum in which you ask narrow questions 
and you play games, as they are in Quebec, to fiddle the results. 
We are going to balance the books of this province, and 
introduce legislation, and do it the Saskatchewan way. 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Ms. Haverstock: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, the people of this province know exactly what this 
government has done to their lives. They know exactly how 
much disposable income they have left in their pockets, and it's 
not much. Saskatchewan, as a province, is seen as out of step 
with the direction being taken by other places. 
 
And while other provinces are setting goals of smaller 
government, and they are not relying on windfall resource 
revenues to balance the books, Saskatchewan has no sustainable 
— with emphasis on the sustainable, Mr. Speaker — plan to 
pay off the debt. 
 
My question to the Finance minister: Madam Minister, can you 
and will you, give your assurance to Saskatchewan people that 
there will be a schedule of debt reduction legislated into the Bill 
that you introduce? And if targets are not met, what indeed will 
be the repercussions? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Speaker, I'm astonished to listen 
to what the member opposite seems to believe are facts. We 
didn't cut spending in this government? Since 1991, we have 
cut spending by over $275 million. Where has she been? 
 
We have balanced the books of this province, and we've laid 
before the people a new plan for their future. We reduced the 
debt of this province $500 million in one year alone. That's 
equivalent to the Government of Canada reducing its debt by 
$16 billion, and we've laid out a schedule for further debt 
reduction. 
 
I will tell the member opposite, there will be very serious 
penalties involved for people in this province who do not 
manage the finances of the province properly. The electorate 
will fire them, as they fired the members opposite in 1991. And, 
Madam Member, they will scrutinize what you say about the 
finances of this province and see if you really have a plan. And 
they will deal you the result that you deserve. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

Sale of Bronson Forest 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 
question is to the Environment minister. Mr. Minister, 
yesterday, or last evening, I had the privilege of attending a 
meeting of about 200 people concerned about the sale of huge 
portions of the Bronson forest, including recreational areas, to 
the Thunderchild Indian Band. And, Mr. Speaker, the people at 
that meeting had several questions they wanted to ask the 
Environment minister. They even made sure that they had it 
noted on the agenda, an agenda I'm sure the minister received. 
The problem is, Mr. Speaker, the Environment minister didn't 
show up. Neither did the NDP MLAs in the area — the 
members for Lloydminster and Meadow Lake. And no offence, 
was it because they had to attend the last supper? I'm not sure. 
 



April 27, 1995 

 
1813 

This is typical of the kind of treatment these people have 
received from this government. Mr. Minister, why didn't you 
attend yesterday's meeting? Why are you refusing to meet with 
the Bronson Ministikwan Concerned Citizens Group? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Wiens: — Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite 
for the question. I can assure the members opposite that I have 
had many discussions and met on several occasions with 
representatives of this group. 
 
I want to say that the issue that has been raised is an issue of 
long-standing discussion. It's been going on for 18 months now 
and our officials have been assigned and special facilitators 
have been assigned to carry out this discussion. That discussion 
has actually been quite a sound discussion and very informative 
to the various parties, has been going on, and we continue to 
. . . we intend to continue to provide an opportunity for 
discussing the issues around the Bronson forest treaty land 
entitlement. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. Minister, the 
people that attended that meeting would like to know which 
meeting you've attended in the past. 
 
Mr. Minister, people have been asking for a meeting. They've 
been asking to meet with you and you simply refuse. In fact 
they had a number of questions they wanted to raise with you, 
and I brought one. First and foremost, the people at the meeting 
passed a resolution opposing any sale of the Bronson forest, 
including the recreational areas within the forest. 
 
Mr. Minister, will you act on this resolution? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Wiens: — Mr. Speaker, I want to report that I met 
with the one representative of that body as recently — if the 
member opposite wants to stop talking and listen for a minute 
— as recently as two weeks ago. I want to say that we met as a 
caucus committee with a larger representative group of that 
organization only several months earlier than that. 
 
I want to say that, as I said earlier, we have provided 
opportunity for discussing this issue. The member opposite may 
not understand the history of treaty land entitlements in 
Saskatchewan, although I would want to give credit to the 
former government for something because they did move some 
of that discussion some distance ahead. 
 
Those treaty land entitlement discussions were finalized in . . . 
after we were elected, and I think it is a significant achievement 
that that occurred. 
 
Under that treaty land entitlement, first nations have an 
opportunity to ask for land to be transferred to them in respect  

of obligations from the past under the agreement. 
 
The band requested the area that's under discussion. And as a 
result of the special circumstance, this land had previously been 
committed to the federal government for the formation of a 
reserve for this band. It was considered appropriate that this 
land again be made available for these discussions. And the 
discussions that have continued since that time have been 
fruitful for all of those who have a cooperative interest in seeing 
to it that our obligations are met. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Mr. Toth: — Mr. Speaker, and to the minister. Mr. Minister, I 
can certainly indicate we have had some interesting discussions 
regarding treaty land entitlement, and I thank the Minister of 
Justice for those discussions. 
 
However, Mr. Minister, the World Wildlife Fund, what kind of 
a recommendation did they give regarding Saskatchewan and its 
endangered species — a D rating. And what the people are 
suggesting up in that area . . . there are areas of the province 
and Crown land that we can certainly make available under the 
treaty land entitlements. There are areas that maybe we should 
look seriously at preserving. 
 
They had a number of other questions. What is the price tag on 
the land? What will happen to lease agreements? Will other 
Saskatchewan people besides aboriginal people be given the 
opportunity to purchase Crown forest land? 
 
Mr. Minister, these questions were asked last night. Will you be 
prepared to meet with these individuals and answer their 
questions directly and will you do that before the next general 
election? Or are you going to do like Mr. Bowerman did before 
the 1982 election: make a promise, so-called promise, prior to 
the election that he could run away from afterwards. Is that 
what your intention is? 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Wiens: — Mr. Speaker, I don't know how much time 
you want me to take to answer this question, but the contentions 
of the member opposite are offensive to say the least about 
good process. 
 
The promise was made to the federal government and I have 
before me . . . and if the Leader of the Opposition would quiet 
himself for a minute, he might learn something. 
 
The Speaker: — Order, order. I think the members asked a 
question. They should give the minister an opportunity to 
answer the question. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wiens: — Thank you. I want to respond first before I 
answer the question to a very inaccurate contention made by the 
member opposite. When the federal government of the day was 
attempting to resolve some of the issues that have not yet been 
resolved, Saskatchewan was asked by the Thunderchild Band  



April 27, 1995 

 
1814 

whether this land might be transferred. Saskatchewan made a 
commitment to the federal government to transfer that land at 
that time. The federal government responded. 
 
If the member has not yet received a copy of this, we can make 
it available to him. He ought to have done his research. By 
saying they thank Saskatchewan for that commitment, the 
federal government did not carry that process forward. There 
was no lack of commitment by Saskatchewan to that 
commitment that was made at that time. 
 
I want to say to the member opposite that with respect to the 
discussion that's gone on, not only have we as a department and 
as myself and as our caucus committee made ourselves 
available for these discussions, but so also has the Thunderchild 
Band. The Thunderchild Band is not obligated under the treaty 
land entitlement to discuss these issues with people who are not 
third-party interest. 
 
The Thunderchild Band has especially gone out of its way to 
have discussions with the community because they believe in 
sound community cooperation. And in a press release issued 
last year, if the member opposite and those who spoke to him to 
say that this did not occur want to contend that they do not 
know the answer to the question the member asks, i.e., what 
will happen to this stuff in the future, they should read from the 
press release that that band . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 

INTRODUCTION OF BILLS 
 

Bill No. 62 — An Act to Maintain Financial Stability and 
Integrity in the Administration of the Finances of the 

Province of Saskatchewan 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Speaker, I move that a Bill to 
Maintain Financial Stability and Integrity in the Administration 
of the Finances of the Province of Saskatchewan be now 
introduced and read the first time. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
Motion agreed to and the Bill ordered to be read a second time 
at the next sitting. 
 

ORDERS OF THE DAY 
 

GOVERNMENT ORDERS 
 

COMMITTEE OF FINANCE 
 

Motions for Interim Supply 
 
The Chair: — Before we proceed to the resolution I would ask 
the minister to introduce again the officials who have joined us 
here this afternoon. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On my  

left I have Bill Jones, the deputy minister of Finance; behind 
Bill I have Larry Spannier, the executive director, the Treasury 
Board branch; behind me I have Craig Dotson, the associate 
deputy minister of budget analysis division. 
 
Seated at the back I have Kirk McGregor, executive director, 
taxation and intergovernmental policy; Jim Marshall, executive 
director, economic and fiscal policy. 
 
 (1430) 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. 
Chairman, Madam Minister, and welcome once again to your 
officials. Yesterday in our discussions there were a number of 
issues that came up and were talked about. And one that you 
said that you couldn't talk about in the Assembly was the one 
that the Premier was making in Kamsack at 5 o'clock yesterday. 
And of course the media today is full of that announcement, but 
very few details. 
 
And as you can appreciate, at least from the comments in the 
media, a lot of the people that were there for the announcement, 
reeves and councillors and town administrators and others, 
they're happy to see the province giving money. But they make 
the comment about how this money is going to come out of 
existing departmental funds, some of which we identified 
yesterday, some of which you did not identify. And we're 
talking I guess here about $6 million. 
 
You said that if this budget isn't passed before the Premier calls 
an election, that this will be the money that carries us through 
until a new government is formed, and I would presume 
perhaps a new budget brought down and all that. 
 
So in light of the fact that the supply Bill you bring before the 
Assembly today in fact is a very important one, because this 
may be the financing of the province until after a new 
government is elected, would you mind giving us a few more 
details, now that the Premier has made the announcement about 
the $6 million — which departments are going to have to give 
that up and how that is going to affect the structure of those 
departments as we go through this period. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, thank you for the 
question. What I will say is the only thing that I can add today 
that I wasn't able to add yesterday is the dollar amount. What 
we're talking about here is $6 million, up to $6 million. That is, 
the associate deputy minister tells me, about one-sixth of one 
per cent of the budget of the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
What we have said is that when you're dealing with one-sixth of 
one per cent, an infinitesimal amount of the whole, total budget 
of the province of Saskatchewan, is that we will be expecting 
these two departments, plus the government generally, to be 
ensuring that in areas where they've managed the finances of 
the province in such a way that money that they had anticipated 
requiring in fact is not required, will be redirected to this 
particular priority. And that is a prudent way to manage the 
finances of the province. And beyond that, I have nothing more  



April 27, 1995 

 
1815 

to say. 
 
The only thing I can add, as I say, is the number and the small 
percentage it is of the total budget. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Well, Madam Minister, you can't lead us off 
on that tangent. You clearly yesterday in questioning said that 
departments like Agriculture and others weren't going to be 
tapped; GRIP (gross revenue insurance program) funds, for 
instance, which are still outstanding would not be tapped. 
 
You said the place that you were going to get the money from 
was primarily Highways and Municipal Government. And then 
you alluded to maybe other agencies. Now I asked you about 
the funds that the minister failed to bring forward by March 31; 
you said definitely not, definitely not. 
 
So, Madam Minister, what percentage, what percentage of the 
departments of Highways and Municipal Government does this 
$6 million make? Because you pretty well ruled out the rest of 
government. You pretty well ruled out the rest of government 
contributing to these funds. 
 
A lot of the existing monies in those two departments are 
already part of cost-sharing agreements. In other words, the 
local municipality, the local town, has to put up so much money 
in order to access so much money. Same goes with Highways. 
What percentage of the departments are we talking about here, 
Madam Minister? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, it's 2 per cent and 4 per cent. What I said to the 
member opposite yesterday is these two departments will be 
asked initially to manage this within their departments. If not, 
we will manage it across government. And what I can add today 
is it's $6 million, so it's the kind of sums that are obviously 
manageable. 
 
I want to alert the member opposite to an issue that I will 
continue to raise with every round of questioning here. What 
we're talking about now is interim supply — money that is 
required by agencies in this province in order for them to 
continue carrying on their businesses. 
 
I want to inform the member that if in fact interim supply is not 
passed today, the following agencies will not have enough 
money to carry on their operations beginning next week: 
transition homes for abused women, group homes for children 
and youth, group homes for mentally handicapped adults, 
sexual assault centres, as well as many other agencies. 
 
What we will be telling these agencies is that we unfortunately 
cannot provide them with the money they require to continue 
their operations because the opposition will not pass interim 
supply, even though we've told the opposition that they have 
estimates as well as interim supply and we would be prepared to 
deal with any of these questions that they're raising in estimates. 
So I must alert the member opposite of the action that we're 
going to be forced to take here. 

Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Minister, 
yesterday and the day before in this House, both you and the 
members of the opposition have talked about all sorts of topics. 
I mean when it suits your purpose, you'll branch off and go 
wherever you feel like and I don't hear you asking Mr. 
Chairman then to shut you up. 
 
So, Madam Minister, this is potentially the funds that will take 
the province of Saskatchewan . . . I mean your Premier can walk 
in here at any time and he can say: Mr. Speaker, I've been over 
to see the Lieutenant Governor and I've asked that they 
prorogue this legislature — plain and simple  no budget. No 
budget passed, Madam Minister. It's just hanging there, just 
hanging there, okay. And then all of the things you just 
mentioned will still have to keep going and you know how 
you'll do it. You'll do it by special warrants, okay. 
 
This supply Bill probably will pass. I'm not sure yet, but it 
probably will pass. This potentially could be the funding that 
we will see take us through the next two months, if there's an 
election call. 
 
Now I'd say it's fairly important that we discuss this because we 
may never get to your estimates. We may never get to the 
Premier's estimates. He may not want to face the heat in the 
House; he may call an election instead. That's his prerogative; 
he can do that. Therefore, this is it and there's lots of topics that 
we have to talk about. 
 
I just took a quick road trip through your spending 
announcements since January 1. And I'll give you an idea of 
where you've been going: wellness grants, over 60,000; 
Grandmother's Bay road, Highways, 770,000; sponsorship of 
business expo, 5,000; Canadian government's on-line projects, 
200,000; Saskatchewan Cancer Foundation, 700,000; Crown 
Life, 150 million; Future Skills, Education, $10 million; 
training at Hitachi, 262,000; Scotty the Dinosaur movie, 1.1 
million; strengthening community health services, 20.3 million; 
ag-food innovation fund, 27 million; SaskFILM (Saskatchewan 
Film and Video Development Corporation) funding, 4 million; 
gambling addiction, $1 million; northern development fund, 2.6 
million; health centre capital projects, 10 million bucks; 
biofermentation, 6 million bucks; more wellness grants, 
$60,000. And that's not even half of it. 
 
I mean, Madam Minister, you've been doing a lot of spending 
since January 1 to date, and there's a lot more than that. Now 
what we have before us here is your two-month look at the 
window, and we may have an election in between. So it's very, 
very reasonable for us to ask you all sorts of questions about the 
funding and what you're going to do. 
 
Now you're telling me, 2 to 4 per cent of the Highways and 
Community Services budget are perhaps going to be 
reapportioned here. The question that is being asked by the 
people out there is, is this going to be a hundred per cent grant, 
or is this contingent upon them coming forward with other 
funding? And if that is the case, then it will impact on other 
funding which they already get under various cost-sharing  



April 27, 1995 

 
1816 

formulas. Now can you answer the question today? Is this 100 
per cent grant money, or is this contingent upon those 
communities, RMs (rural municipality), whatever, out there, 
coming up with a cost-sharing formula to present to you? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — What we've provided for is we've 
allowed municipalities to redirect their capital grants through 
the revenue-sharing program towards maintenance and repair 
activities. And municipalities can also access an additional 2 
million in revenue-sharing grants for their road projects in 
'95-96. There will also be another $4 million in assistance on a 
cost-shared basis with municipalities for roads. So that's the 
specific answer. 
 
On the more general question, I want to remind the member 
opposite, we have said, if he wants to ask these questions, that 
we'll proceed immediately to estimates, and he can ask exactly 
the same questions because what he's holding up here is not the 
government. What he is holding up, if this does not pass today, 
is we will be telling these agencies, sorry, next week we will not 
be able to process your money because the opposition will not 
let interim supply go. Even though we have said to them, we're 
prepared to address exactly these same questions in estimates. 
So I want to be absolutely honest and upfront with the member 
and not find him dealing with a situation that he's not aware of. 
 
We will be telling these groups at the end of today that, sorry, 
you will not be getting money next week even though you need 
it to run your operations, because the opposition will not allow 
us to pass interim supply. We will be explaining to them our 
offer that the minute you pass interim supply, we'll go into 
estimates and address exactly the same question in estimates. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Minister, 
the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Highways tried 
the same thing; tried the same tactics as what you're now doing 
when those two pieces of legislation which hinged upon you 
moving money from last year into this year were before this 
Assembly. 
 
You know what? I'd go back to my office day after day as the 
Agriculture critic, and I'd have to field calls because the 
minister was busy phoning around the province getting people 
to phone me up and threaten me with dire consequences if we 
didn't pass his legislation. 
 
Well, Madam Minister, his legislation went through but it 
wasn't because of the phone calls, I can assure you. And the 
Minister of Highways' Bill didn't go through at all. And all of 
the calling around and all of the malarkey didn't do a bit of 
good, because unfortunately when you try that sort of thing, you 
have exactly the opposite reaction. 
 
I understand about the groups out there. And they all have 
deadlines. We all have deadlines. The simple fact is we've 
asked you a lot of questions in here and you simply don't want 
to give answers. You come before the Assembly with this 
amount of money, with an election looming, perhaps no budget  

passed, and say that you don't have the right to be here asking 
those questions. 
 
I asked you a lot of questions about gambling and the casino 
and the funding of it, and whether it had been to Treasury 
Board and what Treasury Board had agreed to. Did I get any 
answers? No, none whatsoever. 
 
Today we're asking you questions pertaining to a major 
announcement the Premier made yesterday with $6 million and 
how it's going to work, and it's as if it was nothing. 
 
There's going to be a huge impact on how all of those 
organizations out there access money. And a lot of that will be 
tied up in the very money that you come before the Assembly 
for. Has to be; there's no other way around it. They're spending 
money as we speak. 
 
Madam Minister, will the cost sharing that you've identified in 
this announcement be new, or is it the existing cost-sharing 
agreement that they have? 
 
(1445) 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — I say to the member opposite, this is 
a new program which is similar in design to the provincial 
assistance disaster relief program. And I would say to the 
member opposite that it's not . . . . we're not talking about 
tactics here that we're using with the opposition. 
 
We're just saying that we're going to have to tell the people of 
the province what the law allows us to do. The law simply does 
not allow us to spend money to give to those groups that need 
their money next week, those groups that are relying on that 
money, unless this Bill passes because — as I say and I'll say it 
again — we have made the commitment to answer your 
questions to the best of our ability. You may not like the 
answers, but we are providing the answers. And we've also said 
that if you will move to estimates, you can get the answers 
through that process. 
 
For example in this case, what I have to do here is go back and 
try to find out from people fully cognizant of Municipal 
Government, what the detailed answer is to your question. Get 
the Municipal Government administration here, and they can 
give you even better, more detailed answers in a shorter period 
of time. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Well, Madam Minister, that I suppose will 
occur down the road. But my understanding of the way you run 
government  and you were very specific about how you 
manage the pennies  that you and you alone and your 
officials were in charge of everything. And when this item came 
before cabinet the other day, that it would be the Department of 
Finance that would be the lead agency in finding where the cash 
is going to come from and that you'd be asking the various 
departments to give up money in order to meet the needs of an 
emergency. 
 



April 27, 1995 

 
1817 

Now, Madam Minister, you've indicated that you're going to 
find some of it immediately, and then you're going to find some 
of it down the road. In the media reports, the Premier . . . and 
I'll quote from the article, Mr. Chairman, if that's all right. 
 
This is from the Leader-Post — Thursday, April 27, 1995 — 
article by Kevin O'Connor. The member from Riversdale, and I 
won't use his name: 
 
 . . . agreed the amount being set aside likely won't be 

enough to repair all the damage caused by the rain and 
flooding, but could "kickstart" more flood relief. 

 
In other words, that this 6 million is only the beginning of the 
process, that there's more coming. 
 
Now I go back to my original premiss, Madam Minister. If the 
budget isn't passed, if an election is called before the House 
rises, this is what we're dealing with. And after that you're on 
special warrants. So if this is only the kick-start and there's 
more coming — and I suspect more would probably be during 
an election campaign — could you please identify for us what 
more might be and where out of here that more is going to 
come from? 
 
And it is quite realistic that that more might have to come out of 
here, so could you tell us what the Premier meant by 
kick-starting more assistance for what's going on out there? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, everyone in this government manages the pennies 
very carefully. The Minister of Finance cannot do that in and of 
him or herself. So everyone is committed to ensuring that their 
department is run as effectively as possible. 
 
What I will say about what the Premier said is he said 
something very reasonable. He said listen, we've looked at the 
problem; it looks like it's a problem of this sort of magnitude, 
and it looks like this is a reasonable way to deal with it. But 
we'll have to assess it and see whether or not there's things here 
that we're not aware of. 
 
And if you would read on in some of what he said, what he said 
is we will be directing our next avenue to the federal 
government and saying to the federal government, we have a 
very major situation here and we expect you to make some 
contribution. So it's completely premature to talk about (a) us 
putting in more money, whether it will or will not occur; and (b) 
where it would come from. 
 
Because what he said was just a very reasonable statement — 
this looks like a reasonable thing to be doing right now. And I 
notice on the radio this morning many of the municipal leaders 
were saying it looks reasonable. Then he said (b) we're going 
next to the federal government for money. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Madam Minister, can you give me an 
example of where the federal government has paid in money in 
a situation like this in the province of Saskatchewan in recent  

history? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — In 1984 there was flooding — the 
provincial disaster relief assistance program was partially 
cost-shared by the federal government. So there certainly are 
precedents for the federal government to be involved in this sort 
of thing. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — In 1984, was that . . . I don't remember that as 
being a flood year, but that was to do with what area of the 
province, and can you tell me what amount? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, I'd say this. This is the problem: this is interim supply. 
The Municipal Government department I'm sure would have all 
of those details for you and would love to provide them for you. 
But in order to do that, we've got to go on to estimates. 
 
You're asking very detailed questions for a number of 
departments across government, and we simply don't have that 
sort of information available here. But there is another forum 
which we would welcome you to move to, which is estimates, 
in which we would love to give you exactly that information 
and be sure that the Department of Municipal Government had 
it here for you. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — I appreciate that, Madam Minister. Mr. 
Chairman, I won't ask any more questions about recent floods 
in Saskatchewan history. I think what Madam Minister meant 
was 1974, which you and I remember very well, when Moose 
Jaw got clobbered and a lot of the South was flooded. One of 
the reasons we had to build the Rafferty-Alameda complex, to 
keep a lot of communities from being flooded. But I'll restrict 
my comments, Mr. Chairman, to the issue at hand. 
 
Madam Minister, let's go back to 1995, April 27, which is really 
what I'm concerned about because you've come before the 
Assembly with spending estimates for the next two months. 
And those spending estimates may have to cover off a lot of 
things for your government, depending on what happens. I 
mean if Madam Minister wishes to stand up and clarify the fact 
that we're not going to have an election writ any time in the next 
two months, then I might be prepared to restrict my comments 
in some areas to estimates. If I can have that assurance, I'll be 
glad to restrict my comments. 
 
But so far nobody's told me that that won't occur. And it's 
reasonable for me, as the Finance critic, to ask you questions 
about things that will occur perhaps during an election 
campaign, is it not? I mean we're then into a whole different 
ball game. I can't ask those questions any more. I'm done. I'm no 
longer an MLA — gone. You're still the Minister of Finance; 
you can spend money — and you will spend money. We know 
that you've planned to spend money during an election 
campaign. Therefore we have to ask you questions with what 
we have at hand, and that is your spending estimates before the 
House. 
 
I go back to the premiss that the Premier has said that this is a  



April 27, 1995 

 
1818 

kick-start for more flood relief. If, Madam Minister, the federal 
government, who are very strapped for cash these days, say it is 
your problem, there is no more money, where in this interim 
supply Bill, where in government, would you come up with the 
funds to go beyond what the Premier announced yesterday? 
And usually when you use the phrase kick-start, you're talking 
about a small amount of something bigger to come. In other 
words, this is just the beginning of the money that he's going to 
promise for this situation. 
 
The federal government says no, not at all, there's no money. 
Then where are you going for the money that you'll need in 
order to fund his further program? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, again, just to clarify the situation with respect to 
interim supply and estimates. What we're saying is that there is 
another forum in which exactly these questions can be asked, 
and can be asked more effectively because you can actually 
have the department here with all of the details that you require. 
And if you use that forum, you don't have to inconvenience the 
people of Saskatchewan who are depending on getting their 
money to run their agencies next week. 
 
So we are certainly prepared to answer those questions. There is 
a forum in which they can be asked, and we will answer them. 
 
Going back to what the Premier said, all I can say to the 
member opposite is what I said to him before: what the Premier 
obviously meant — and I don't want to interpret his words — 
but to me, what kick-start was referring to is that they are now 
going to go to the federal government and make a case to the 
federal government and say, we have a very serious situation in 
this province and we will expect some assistance from you. And 
I'm sure that that is what the kick-start is. 
 
But it is much, much too early in the situation to be talking 
about what comes next, beyond the fact that we're heading to 
the federal government and saying that they have a role to play 
here as well. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Well two points, Madam Minister. You told 
me — I didn't tell you; you told me — that there was going to 
be Highways, Municipal Government, and other agencies. Now 
to drag all of those people in here at once isn't allowed. We'd 
have to go through it one by one by one. That might take quite 
some time. Obviously if we have all of these other players 
involved in this, that means that someone is giving them 
direction. Okay? And that's usually the Finance minister. 
 
And the other point is, I wish it were so easy. I saw the Premier 
recently trundle off to Ottawa when Ralph Goodale axed the 
Crow, and you know what? He didn't come back with one red 
cent. I mean he went charging off with the flags waving and the 
horns blaring — I'm going to Ottawa and I'm going to change 
this around. And what did he come back with? Not a whole lot, 
Madam Minister — not one thin dime. 
 
So I wouldn't keep my hopes up too much for the Premier to go  

off and ask for some flood relief. You're the one that said there 
were going to be a lot of players in the action here. But there 
isn't one of those agencies could come in here and tell me what 
the other guy was doing. And you know it. 
 
There's only one place that comes from and that's the 
Department of Finance because you're in charge of the extra 
funds. Now I asked you yesterday if those extra funds might 
include the money that the Minister of Highways was trying to 
bring into the legislature as of March 31. 
 
He said he had 20 million bucks for infrastructure, and if we 
would simply allow him to do it, then there was going to be all 
sorts of money for road infrastructure. He mentioned about the 
member from Maple Creek bringing in his highway petitions — 
there'd be money for that; there'd be money for this; and money 
over here. 
 
Madam Minister, is the Minister of Highways going to move 
the $20 million from last year's budget, because your budget 
number has changed. You had a surplus of 177 million? 178 
million? . . . whatever it was. That figure I presume now will be 
higher by $20 million. The budget surplus for '94-95 will now 
be higher by 20 million bucks and the one this year will be 
lower by 20 million bucks. 
 
There is no way for that minister to move that money now? Is 
that . . . we are led to understand that that's simply gone and 
that's gone into the surplus and it stays there and there will be 
no attempt to do anything with road infrastructure in this 
province with the money that previously would have been 
allocated. 
 
(1500) 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, and to the member 
opposite. First of all, with respect to what is the lead agency. 
The Department of Finance is not the lead agency on this issue. 
The way the government works is, on any one issue in which 
there are two or three departments involved, there is a lead 
agency, which is the one that collects the information, makes 
the proposals and carries the day. 
 
And I'll assist the member opposite to know which department 
he will want to ask these questions of. It's the Department of 
Highways that is the lead agency on this particular issue. So 
they're are the ones that are going to be able to do the best job 
of giving you all the detail that you're asking for here. 
 
Now he's asked another question about the transportation 
partnership. And as was stated in the House at the time, the 
opposition had a choice there. They could have passed the 
legislation by March 31, or the legislation died on the order 
paper. 
 
And so the legislation has died on the order paper. And as we 
said at that time, there's no way to transfer funds from one year 
to the other. So there's no capacity to do that and it will not be 
done. 



April 27, 1995 

 
1819 

Mr. Swenson: — As I look at the Highways and Transportation 
numbers here that you've brought forward on your Bill, we're 
talking about 20 . . . a tad over 28 million. Is that the number as 
I read it? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Yes, the member is correct. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — So 2.8 million and that . . . so if we took even 
10 per cent of that, we'd only be looking at $280,000. You told 
me previously that we were looking at 2 to 4 per cent of the 
department; 4 per cent of that is about $140,000 that the 
minister would have available, under at least this appropriation, 
to move into a $6 million-plus program. That obviously would 
mean nothing. 
 
So that means that the minister would have to move his entire 
budget on a fast-forward back to present in order to come up 
with anything significant at all for people to operate under. Six 
million dollars according to your schedule, Madam Minister, is 
the next three appropriations inclusive of the Department of 
Highways if you went two-twelfths each time. That takes us 
June, July, August, September, October, just to meet . . . if you 
kept on the same schedule. 
 
Can you tell me what the Minister of Highways has in mind 
with the money that's been appropriated to him already, 
especially given the fact that you may be into an election 
campaign? Would the Minister of Highways then have to go on 
special warrants in order to meet the requirements of the 
program the Premier announced? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Let me clarify some of the numbers 
here. The budget for the Department of Highways is about 168 
million, so two-twelfths is about 28 million. Only 4 million of 
that 6 is coming out of Highways, and it may very well not 
come out for several months. Because, I mean, what we've been 
told, I gather  and this is why you need the Department of 
Highways here to get all your details that you're asking  but I 
gather we've been told it's too wet to start doing anything right 
now. So this . . . you may very well find that not a cent of this 
28 will go into that because it will be more than two months 
before the key part of the work can even commence. 
 
But again I come back to my major point. These are very good 
and interesting questions, and they're worth asking. But you 
should be asking them of the people who can give you the best 
and most detailed answers, and that's the Department of 
Highways. So I would suggest that that's the best place to get 
these detailed answers. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — My colleague raises a good point. How 
would you ever ask a guy a question that's never in the House? 
Well I guess, Madam Minister, I go back to the question. If you 
can guarantee me absolutely that all these people are going to 
be available and we're not going to get the pin pulled on us here 
for a June election, then I'd be more than willing. 
 
But you understand the predicament I'm in. I'm the Finance 
critic. You come forward asking for fairly large sums of money.  

I have no guarantee at all that I'm going to get the opportunity 
to ask those people. Plain and simple. This House could sit here 
for weeks yet, absolutely weeks yet, before we got all of the 
questions and the answers. And that's quite reasonable. 
 
Madam Minister, if the . . . And I go back to the other question 
I asked you  and this is one that you would directly have to 
deal with  the demand for extra funds And I am concerned 
about that, because that demand may come on — say — six 
weeks from now, eight weeks from now, when we are in the 
middle of an election campaign. 
 
And I'm wondering what the response would be for a demand 
for significant amounts of money. And obviously the federal 
government isn't probably going to give you any money during 
the middle of an election campaign. At least I wouldn't expect 
the Liberals to give you a bunch of money in the middle of an 
election campaign. And the Premier is going to want to give out 
some more money. 
 
Can you give us some indication of where in government you 
might be able to come up with more money if the Premier 
decided to announce something in the near future that would 
help this flood-stricken area of the province? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite. What I'm trying to say to the member opposite is that 
this isn't about my problem, your problem, this side of the 
House's problem, that side of the House's problem. What this is 
about . . . it's about the fact that today is the last day in which 
we can pass interim supply and still guarantee that the groups 
that I talked about — transition homes for abused women, 
group homes for children and youth, group homes for mentally 
handicapped adults, and sexual assault centres — will have the 
money they require in order to continue their operations. 
 
And so what I said, if the member opposite passes interim 
supply, we can go on to estimates. We can answer exactly these 
questions. In fact if he allows the departments that he most 
wants to ask questions of in here, he can do a better job because 
they'll have more detail. 
 
Now with respect to your specific question, we're talking about 
a pretty extended time frame here. And again I'm reluctant to 
get into this because it's Highways that should be talking about 
the details. 
 
But essentially it looks something like this. It will probably be 
into the summer before things have actually dried out, people 
have actually been able to get onto the roads, and figure out the 
extent of the damage. So I'm not sure why the member would 
see a reason for the government today to be sitting here and 
planning — we're going to give extra money; where is it coming 
from? — because what we have said is two things. We're going 
to the federal government, and we're going to wait until we can 
reasonably see what the damage is. And if you want a rough 
estimate when that might be, probably sometime in the summer. 
 



April 27, 1995 

 
1820 

Mr. Swenson: — So, Mr. Chairman, did I hear Madam 
Minister say that there wasn't going to be an election in June 
and that we would have the appropriate time to review this stuff 
and that because the demands weren't coming till summer that 
there was no need to worry about whether we appropriate the 
government money or not? Is that what I heard her say? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — The member opposite knows that I 
said nothing about an election, and I'm not the person who 
decides when an election is. 
 
What I said to the member opposite is, that with respect to the 
roads that you're worried about in the flooded part of the 
province, you should be asking the Department of Highways for 
the details. But if you want me to give you a rough guess as to 
when we're going to know whether or not further assistance is 
required, a rough guess is probably something like the summer. 
But as I say, you need to ask the Department of Highways. 
 
What I've said to the member opposite is that we shouldn't be 
playing silly politics with this supply Bill because the many 
agencies, especially the smaller ones that run on shoestring 
budgets, require their money in order to be able to continue 
their operations. 
 
And I think it's incumbent upon all of us to set aside our 
differences, especially when I've offered you another forum in 
which we can go through this process, and ensure that these 
people get their money when they need it. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of 
points, Madam Minister. My experience from being in 
government is that when these things happen, most often people 
say, why does the government manage its affairs so sloppily? I 
never did once see them point the finger at anyone else. 
 
And the other point is — and you know that full well — the 
other point is I didn't see the Minister of Highways yesterday 
making the announcement. She and the Minister of Agriculture 
conveniently were off in a plane some place flying around 
looking at the flooding. 
 
The individual yesterday who seemed to be doing all the talking 
and doing all the promising and laying out the skimpy details 
was the Premier. It wasn't the member from Melfort there front 
and centre with the pope, and I kind of would have thought 
maybe the person that should know would be the one. But it 
wasn't; it's the Premier that staged this event, made the 
promises, and talked about the kick-start. 
 
Now maybe the proper thing to do would be to drag him back 
in here and we'd plunk him down in his chair with his political 
officials that he has around him all the time, and get into what 
he said, and what he promised, and what he might promise in 
the future. Because as I read the media, there is an explicit 
promise here from the Premier of the province of Saskatchewan 
that there is more to come, folks. I'm on your side; I'm here in 
Kamsack today; I got my rubber boots on. I've been out; I've  

had a look at all the damage. And I can assure you that I'm on 
your side and if you just stay with me, I'll promise you some 
more. 
 
Now that's the way I read the reports, Madam Minister. I wasn't 
there, but it does say that the Minister of Agriculture and the 
Minister of Community Services were up in the plane flying 
around somewhere. Okay? Premier. Premier made the promise. 
And I would suggest to you that he wouldn't be the first Premier 
that in the middle of an election campaign made a promise. 
 
That means that there's more money coming. We're in interim 
supply. Where is the money coming from is my question, 
Madam Minister. Where are you going to come up with the 
Premier's promise: and there's more to come? So far you tell me 
Highways and Community Services are coming up with some 
of it, and they'll compress their budgets as need be. Where, 
Madam Minister, are you going to come up with the rest of it 
from? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, I say to the member 
opposite, I'm actually doodling circles on my paper here 
because we're going in circles here. He asks me a question, I 
give him the answer. He says I won't answer the question 
because he doesn't like the answer I give him. The problem is 
it's the only answer I've got because it happens to be the truth. 
 
What the Premier said was, he said look, we're going to assess 
the situation. If he said anything about money — I know what 
he said — he said he's going to approach the federal 
government about money. 
 
And all I can say is what I've said to you again and again. We 
will assess the situation. It will take several months. We will 
approach the federal government. And so we simply can't sit 
here as a government and make plans about, well now what will 
we do if this should happen. You wait till something happens, 
you assess it, and then you determine what you're going to do. 
But the Premier made one commitment about money, and that 
was the commitment to put in the dollars that he announced and 
to approach Ottawa for further funds. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Well one final question then, Madam 
Minister, on this topic. And then we'll take your advice — 
providing you answer it properly — and move on to another 
area of our discussion. Are you prepared to categorically say 
that there will not be expenditures made by the Premier in the 
month of June pertaining to this program? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — What I can say to the member 
opposite is that this interim supply Bill will be what the 
government is allowing other agencies or itself to spend in the 
months of May and June. 
 
I can't commit on behalf of the Premier. I have no reason to 
believe that he has any intentions to do any spending at all. That 
is my understanding. But I can't commit. I don't know what is 
going to occur in this province in the next six to eight weeks. 
It's impossible. 



April 27, 1995 

 
1821 

And this becomes a little frustrating with groups that always are 
talking about, well let's tie the hands of the government so the 
government can't do that. Let's tie the hands of the government 
so the government can't do that. 
 
Two months ago we didn't know there was going to be a flood. 
Couldn't make a commitment that we're never going to spend 
any money to deal with that situation. What if there's an 
earthquake? Are we supposed to say, oh no, I'm sorry, I 
promised the member from Thunder Creek that I wouldn't allow 
the Premier, and the Premier said he would never spend any 
money no matter what happened? 
 
You simply can't make those sorts of commitments. What I can 
commit to you is that the money that will be spent in the next 
two months is the money that you would be passing if you 
passed this interim supply. 
 
(1515) 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Madam Minister, unfortunately that's kind of 
what I expected. In other words, we got down to a bunch of 
weasel words about what the Premier might and might not do, 
and you don't have any control over that, and he might spend 
the money. And that's the problem with that Bill you brought 
into the House today, is that there are no controls. 
 
You know there are lots of jurisdictions in North America that 
have very stringent budget controls and budget legislation and 
they have disasters all the time. And they get around them, 
because they're quite prepared to lay out to the people, because 
of that balanced budget legislation, exactly where they're going. 
And they are quite prepared to go back to the people with 
various mechanisms and not have this fudgey, four-year, sort of 
political document that you brought in. And they have disasters 
all the time. 
 
Madam Minister, you could have very stringent legislation and 
still deal with things like this flooding, but the government 
would have to be very open in how it came back and solicited 
the funds. You couldn't have the situation which you just 
weaselled on me where we could have the Premier running 
around rural Saskatchewan in a month's time in the middle of 
an election campaign, saying, I'm going to give you some more 
to fix your roads. 
 
See, you'd make a big political promise out of it rather than 
having some legislation that controlled that. He couldn't do that 
under our legislation. He couldn't. But he can do it under what 
you've proposed. 
 
Okay, Madam Minister, I believe that you should be able to say 
to this Assembly that there will not be a political promise tied to 
the disaster that people are going through in eastern 
Saskatchewan right now  flooding  having their homes 
flooded, Mr. Chairman. 
 
The Chair: — Order, order. I'm having difficulty hearing the 
member from Thunder Creek put his question. He's not sitting  

all that far from me. 
 
An Hon. Member: — He wasn't saying anything. 
 
The Chair: — Order. Order. And I will ask for the cooperation 
of members of the committee to allow the member from 
Thunder Creek to continue with his questions. Thank you for 
your cooperation. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I 
appreciate the enthusiasm of all those members, some of whom 
have seats over on the east side of the province. And I'm sure 
that they are wondering, as we are, about what exactly the 
Premier meant yesterday about the money he's expending on 
behalf of the taxpayers for their area of the province. And I 
assume that they're also wondering what the Premier meant 
when he said it was simply a kick-start of more to come. And 
I'm sure people in their constituencies will be asking them about 
the time schedule of the kick-start and the more funds to come, 
and how this Assembly is going to deal with it. And I suppose 
that's why they are so loud because of the anticipation they feel 
about more money coming into their area. 
 
What we're trying to define in the Assembly today, Mr. 
Chairman, in the interim supply and the money that the minister 
is asking for today to get us through to the end of June, is how 
much of this money is going to end up in the Premier's program. 
How much of this money may potentially end up in the 
Premier's announcement? And if it isn't this money, which 
would have to be the money that would carry this province 
through to the end of June, where will the money come from if 
it isn't this here? 
 
And the Finance minister said what she would guarantee is that 
there would be no more, and it's not this money — no more. 
But she will not categorically say that the Premier won't be 
making more announcements potentially in the middle of an 
election campaign all up and down the east side of this 
province. 
 
So if he's going to make that promise, I would like to know, Mr. 
Chairman, where the money is coming from. And that's a very 
simple question. It's something I think every taxpayer would 
understand. If this is all there is, there isn't any more, okay; and 
if the election is called, this is it — there is no more. And yet 
another announcement is made. All I'm asking is where is it 
coming from? Now if there's no announcements coming, then 
I'm satisfied. That's fine. 
 
There won't be any need for any more because the minister said 
these departments are simply going to fast forward their money 
up and they'll be ready to look after the needs of the 
announcement, and they can handle it within their existing 
budgets; those budgets will not grow. That's fine. 
 
But I haven't heard the minister say that there will be no more 
announcements before this funding expires in the case that the 
legislature prorogues and that there isn't access to any more 
money anywhere else. And I haven't heard her say that yet, Mr.  



April 27, 1995 

 
1822 

Chairman, and it's a simple question. And it's something I think 
people in the province, on the east side, anywhere that you're a 
taxpayer, would clearly want to understand. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, I'm drawing my 
circles again because we're going in circles. To me I've given a 
clear answer to the member opposite, and the only possible 
answer to the member opposite. What I have said . . . and I'm 
very nervous when the member opposite says the minister has 
made commitments, because it didn't sound like any 
commitments that came out of my mouth. 
 
What I said was this. I said the Premier made an announcement 
yesterday that there would be up to $6 million available because 
the assessment that we have right now suggests that that is what 
will be required to deal with the problem. He made no reference 
to the fact that more is on the way. What he made reference to 
was . . . he talked about money, approaching the federal 
government. But it's impossible for me to stand here and tell 
you what's going to happen in the next six weeks. 
 
I mean would you like me to stand here . . . and I'm always 
worried what he does with Hansard, so don't take this sentence 
without the preface: would you like me to stand here and say, I 
commit that not a penny more will go into the north-east, no 
matter how much snow falls and no matter how much rain 
comes in the next six weeks, that's it. That would be unrealistic 
and unfair to those people. 
 
And that's a problem I have with some of these attempts to 
hamstring government; no matter what, we're not going to do 
this. So I have no other answer for the member, except to say 
this is what is committed now and reassessment will occur. If 
there is a likely time frame, my guess is the summer. But if you 
want a specific answer, ask Highways. 
 
I think we're going in circles; there is no other answer to be 
given, because neither you nor I can predict what's going to 
happen in the next six or eight weeks. Do you know if it's going 
to continue to rain or snow? I don't. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Mr. Chairman, the minister is absolutely 
right; none of us can predict those things. But what we can 
predict, and what we should think about in here, is that if more 
money is going to be spent, then it is logical that that spending 
would come here, okay. That's logical. I've heard the Finance 
minister make that argument. I've been chairman of Public 
Accounts; I've sat on Public Accounts. I've had the auditor 
comment on it many times, about that type of spending, that this 
would be the place to do it. 
 
That may not be the case, Mr. Chairman. We're getting three 
and a half years into a term, anything's possible. There's been a 
lot of speculation about a June election. 
 
If that's the case — and I appreciate the minister's probably 
drawing circles again — but the simple fact is, Mr. Chairman, if 
the Premier . . . and he's already done it once, okay. It was six 
yesterday. If the Premier decides to go out and spend some  

more, there may not be an opportunity for this Assembly to 
scrutinize any of that, okay. That will have to come from 
somewhere. 
 
And this Finance minister says there is a bottom line and it will 
not move. She manages her pennies, even though she goes out 
and hires people like my friend Rod Laporte, for $44,000 in the 
dying day of a term, but she manages her pennies. And we're 
really concerned that if announcements pertaining to 
expenditures are going to be made, that they should not be 
made in the middle of an election campaign, Mr. Chairman; that 
they should be made while this House is in session and we 
should scrutinize how this expenditure affects the monies that 
the minister asks for. Okay? 
 
And I may not get the opportunity to have an entire budget 
presented. That's not unreasonable. It's happened in this House 
many times. We simply prorogue, there's an election called — 
boom! No budget passed. If that be the case, then we have to 
work with the cards that we're dealt. The cards that we're dealt 
is this interim supply motion. 
 
If Madam Minister would simply say, well, I guess we'd use 
special warrants and we'd go get the money, or something to 
that effect. I mean I'm sure she must . . . she's got her officials 
here; she must have all sorts of answers of how it would be 
handled and where the money would come from. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, I really . . . I don't 
know what to say except, as I say, you're right; I'm drawing the 
circles again. 
 
Governments simply don't run on that basis. That is, we don't sit 
here and say, well now what would we do if it keeps raining for 
six weeks? Where would we find the money to do that? 
Because we could sit here and say . . . because there's no 
evidence, we don't have any evidence it's going to continue to 
rain for six weeks; nobody knows. It would be the same as 
sitting here, well what do we do if interest rates went up 5 per 
cent? What would we do if the price of wheat dropped 10 per 
cent? 
 
We only start looking at what our options are when we know 
that something is going to happen. We do not know that the 
problem is worse than what we've estimated right now, and we 
will not sit here and try and figure out what we would do if it 
were worse until we have some evidence. 
 
So as I say, you're asking me questions; I'm giving you the same 
answer because it is the only answer. We simply do not have in 
place contingencies for things that might happen. Because if we 
ever did that, the government would be totally bogged down in 
looking at a hypothetical, which is what it is. Neither you nor I 
know if it's going to continue to rain. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well because 
Madam Minister will not -- will not relieve the anxiety that 
taxpayers will feel about the Premier running off and making 
election promises in the middle of someone else's disaster . . .  



April 27, 1995 

 
1823 

and that's what it is. There's people out there, they don't want to 
be flooded, they don't want to not sow a crop this year, they do 
not want to sandbag their homes, but they are forced to do it. 
And I think it is really inappropriate that you wouldn't 
categorically say that their misery is not going to be part of 
some election promise of your government and your Premier 
four, six weeks down the road. 
 
I don't know why you'd want to be in that position, but you 
don't seem to want to deny it to this Assembly and the taxpayers 
of this province. So I guess we'll have to leave it and you can 
handle it at some later date. And I guess if you think that that's 
appropriate, that's fine and dandy. 
 
Yesterday before the Assembly rose I was asking you some 
questions about Treasury Board process and the expenditures of 
money, dealing with the downtown casino. And you brought up 
the name of a Candace Fox who did a study for the casino 
corporation. And I asked you if that was the basis of the report 
to Treasury Board, and you categorically said no. And at that 
point, the Associate Minister of Finance rose and asked that the 
committee shut down. 
 
I'm wondering if you could tell me what was the basis of the 
report that went to Treasury Board — who prepared it and what 
the basis of that analytical work was to give the member from 
Elphinstone, your campaign manager, the authority to go and 
contract the building of the casino. 
 
(1530) 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite. The process that was followed was a standard process. 
A request comes from the Gaming Corporation; it's analysed by 
the people at the Department of Finance and any other 
departments if they happen to have an interest in the topic, and 
then a decision is made. 
 
But what I want to emphasize here is that we're on interim 
supply. There is simply no money in this budget going to the 
Gaming Corporation. So people do not have to be concerned 
about passing interim supply and doing anything with respect to 
the Gaming Corporation because this interim supply Bill has 
nothing to do with passing any money to the Gaming 
Corporation. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Well, on the third day, Madam Minister, 
that's a rather weak defence. We've talked about the Gaming 
Corporation in this committee, Mr. Chairman, for extended 
periods of time. We've gone through a lot of questions. We're 
actually starting to get somewhere on the questioning and I 
don't know why the minister would want to stop now. 
 
I mean I finally have got it down to the fact that this thing did 
go through Treasury Board with some type of analysis by her 
officials that allowed the member to go off and start contracting 
and spending money. And we know that we're right down to the 
fixtures of the place and what it's going to look like and 
everything else. 

And it's important because the revenue stream, Mr. Chairman, 
impacts on the budget and the money that flows back into the 
Consolidated Fund from the Liquor and Gaming Commission. 
Government's projected income from the Liquor and Gaming 
Commission, okay, back to the Consolidated Fund. Not the 
casino; they have projected nothing on the casino for four years, 
which is an interesting little exercise in itself. 
 
But the fact is that this project downtown is totally being 
financed out of cash flow of the Liquor and Gaming 
Commission, okay, because there is no casino right now. So 
you've got no revenue coming from . . . you've got no revenue at 
all coming from the casino itself. You're in the construction 
phase and the contractor is paying for the building, and he's 
going to put the building up, and he's going to turn the keys 
over. 
 
But there still won't be any revenue. And it probably will take 
months and months before that revenue stream ever gets 
anywhere near being able to support the lease arrangement. So 
it's important that we know that Treasury Board was involved in 
this, that it went through the Treasury Board ministers, and they 
gave the okay for this self-financing arrangement which most 
Crown corporations don't have. 
 
Now what I would like from you, Madam Minister, you 
mention this individual, this Candace Fox who gave an 
assessment of when profitability would start to occur and when 
the revenue streams would begin to support the casino so that 
you wouldn't be robbing from the rest of the operation and 
therefore potentially robbing from your dividend back to the 
taxpayer. 
 
Do your Treasury Board analysis . . . was it similar to the one 
done by Candace Fox? You say you didn't use her. Did your 
numbers correspond with what she projected as far as revenue 
stream and then what that revenue stream would be on a 
monthly basis? Did your Treasury Board analysis correspond 
with hers? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, again I'm so leery when the member interprets what I 
said because I didn't say that at all about the Candace Fox 
report. The report was done for the Saskatchewan Liquor and 
Gaming Authority to assess the market potential; is there a 
market in this province for a casino? So the question has no 
relevance because that wasn't the purpose of her study initially. 
 
I will bring the member back to the main issue though at hand, 
and that issue is this, that today we need to pass interim supply. 
Otherwise we're going to have to inform groups like the 
following: transition homes for abused women, group homes 
for children and youth, group homes for mentally handicapped 
adults, sexual assault centres. And we will add to the list as the 
day or evening or early morning wears on. We will have to tell 
them that we cannot provide them with the money that they are 
requiring because the opposition will not pass interim supply. 
And in fact they're talking about the Gaming Corporation which 
doesn't even have any money involved in interim supply. 



April 27, 1995 

 
1824 

So I would urge the members to think carefully about what 
we're saying here. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Well, Mr. Chairman, the minister simply 
can't get away with that. She told me yesterday just before we 
closed down. She said the projections were for 10-million-plus 
of revenue — it's in Hansard — and that there is a capacity in 
the province to manage casinos and look at the profitability of 
casinos. There is a capacity for one significant, profitable 
casino. I mean you were talking about the revenue streams 
yesterday, Madam Minister, being 10-million-plus. 
 
I asked you a minute ago about the analysis that you took 
forward to Treasury Board about the monthly revenue streams 
that support the leases on the building, and you tell me that no 
such thing was discussed yesterday. I don't know why you 
would want to do that. I mean all that does is make us 
suspicious about what you're up to. 
 
If you have done the analytical work  and you've said that it 
went to Treasury Board, and you've analysed the stream of 
revenue  all I'm asking you is what it is. We know the capital 
cost of the project. We know what kind of a lease arrangement 
will probably have to be in place to sustain it. Why don't you 
just tell us what your revenue stream that you have projected 
from your Treasury Board analysis is, and we can get on with it. 
You've already told me that Candace Fox said it's 
10-million-plus. All I said, did your stuff correspond with it? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — All I can say to the member 
opposite is obviously there would be no reason for any 
estimates in revenue to be inconsistent with that report done. 
What the report did . . . and it was talked about at the time. This 
is not a secret report. It was done by the Liquor and Gaming 
Authority. 
 
And the issue that was asked was exactly what I said in my 
response yesterday. Is there a capacity here to generate revenue 
from a casino and what is the capacity? And she made some 
assessments. And if you get the Saskatchewan Liquor and 
Gaming Authority here, I'm sure you can get the exact report, 
and they can give you all the information that you require. 
 
But, again, there's no money in this interim supply going to the 
Gaming Corporation. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — I don't know why you don't want to answer 
the question. I was asking you about Treasury Board analysis. I 
said, did you agree with Ms. Fox. You said that she had nothing 
to do with it. She didn't talk about numbers. Hansard proves 
that she did talk about numbers. 
 
Now you're saying I've got to go back to the liquor and gaming 
commission, that there is no Treasury Board analysis and 
revenue stream. That's all I asked. That's three times. 
 
You say you brought it to Treasury Board, that you followed the 
practice all the way through, that the analysis was done separate 
from Candace Fox, that you didn't necessarily use her  

as your analytical work. 
 
I just asked you what the revenue projections were, the monthly 
projections that you used for Treasury Board — nothing 
difficult — because then we can ascertain whether you can 
sustain the monthly lease fees or whatever, the expenditures. It's 
a simple process, Madam Minister. That's all we're asking 
about, nothing more, nothing more. You can end this particular 
line of questioning very easily. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, what I've said to the 
member opposite is I'm sure when the Department of Finance 
officials did their analysis, they consulted all kinds of 
documents including  I'm sure  the Fox report. I don't know 
what use they made. They would have consulted it. 
 
I said to you, again, we don't have estimates of the revenue 
stream because there's no revenue in this budget with respect to 
the Gaming Corporation. And I've said that. I'm drawing circles 
again because we keep going around this circle. 
 
You say well you won't give us the answer. I say well here is 
the answer, and that's all the information we have. And the 
question comes back, and we have the same answer. So what 
concerns me is that there's a very serious issue at stake, which is 
the capacity of these agencies — which I have listed and will 
continue to list — to function, and we're talking about 
something that isn't even included in this interim supply Bill. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Well, Mr. Chairman, let's be fair here. I don't 
set the agenda of the House; that's her colleague  the very 
same minister we're discussing, the guy that's got control of the 
operation downtown, the guy that's able to cash flow from 
inside like nobody else in Crown land that I know of. The 
minister says it's been to Treasury Board. She won't give us any 
answers. I have a sneaking suspicion, Mr. Chairman. If it got 
anything more than a cursory look, that was it  okay? And 
we're off, launched. 
 
Madam Minister, I didn't determine that your interim supply 
Bill didn't come forward until just the other day. Your House 
Leader did that. If you were so concerned about all of the 
third-party agencies you just described who may suffer, then 
talk to your House Leader. I simply get up and ask the questions 
when I get the opportunity. I'd have gladly done this last week. 
I'd have done it last week so that there weren't women out there 
who are being abused and battered who are worrying about 
their next meal or if the lights are going to go out or if they're 
going to have a bed to sleep in. 
 
I'd have gladly done it last week. But the member from 
Elphinstone didn't want it brought to the House, so what am I 
supposed to do? You know. Don't chastise me. You sit at the 
cabinet table with him. If you've got a problem with the way he 
runs the House, please bring it up. I would have loved to have 
had a week and a half, at least, so that's a moot point, Madam 
Minister. It's got nothing to do with the opposition and the 
timing of all the poor unfortunate people out there that you're 
not going to be able to pay because you didn't bring your  



April 27, 1995 

 
1825 

interim supply Bill before the House. 
 
So don't even bother raising that point again. It's absolutely 
moot, absolutely moot . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . please do, 
please send the letters out. I'd love to talk to each and every one 
of them and explain to them why their particular funding didn't 
come before the House sooner. I'd love to do that. 
 
Now, Madam Minister, why don't you simply answer the 
question. You have determined that this Crown is different, that 
it's off on its own, it's doing things differently. All I want to 
know is what did Treasury Board come up with as a reasonable 
return for that casino operation on a monthly basis from the 
time it opens, which we are told is Grey Cup — okay? — until 
the end of the fiscal year. Let's narrow it down. Let's narrow it 
down, from the time the casino opens until the end of the 
current fiscal year. You must have that kind of information. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Well as I would say to the member 
opposite again, we're going in circles. There's no revenue 
stream in this budget for the Gaming Corporation for the 
casinos. And as soon as we know what that revenue stream is, 
we will inform the members opposite in the legislature. 
 
I would say this about interim supply, if the member . . . and I 
appreciate the fact that perhaps he wanted to deal with this last 
week. That certainly wasn't communicated to me . . . would 
have been quite pleased to deal with it had you communicated 
that. This is the third time that we've been here. 
 
But I certainly will make the member opposite two offers 
because, as I say, when we start telling people the money isn't 
coming, we want to be clear that we did everything we could to 
get it to them. And so what we will do is one of two things. We 
will, if you want to pass interim supply, we could immediately 
go to estimates and deal with these questions. Or we're prepared 
by mutual consent to sit here as long as we require — 2, 3 in the 
morning, 6 in the morning — so that you can ask as many 
questions as you want. 
 
But I'll tell you, when we tell people that their money isn't 
coming, we're going to show them that we have done 
everything possible to ensure that their money is in their hands. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Now, Mr. Chairman, it goes back to where 
we got yesterday, and Madam Minister started to lecture us in 
how we should handle our affairs and how this House should 
be run and why it's all right for New Democrats to ask questions 
on the interim supply for days on end and weeks on end, but it 
isn't for Tories. 
 
You know, it just boggles your imagination that that attitude is 
exhibited after four years by a member of this Assembly. And 
there's a lot of long-standing members of this Assembly sitting 
in here who know full well that interim supply, interim supply 
can be debated for great lengths of time and has been debated 
for great lengths of time. And you know what, Mr. Chairman? 
At the end of the day, the province carried on. It didn't matter 
which party was in power and who was asking the questions,  

but you know what? The province carried on. 
 
(1545) 
 
You know, I've never seen the lights go out, Mr. Chairman, 
because interim supply was being debated in the House. Never 
seen the lights go out. I've never seen anything come to a 
grinding halt. I've never seen anybody starve to death. I've never 
seen anybody thrown out in the cold because . . . but you know, 
Madam Minister says, look it, you either do it on my time 
frame, on my agenda, or I'm going to punish you. I'm going to 
make you sit here all night, or I'm going to punish you in some 
way. 
 
Now the government controls the agenda here — not the 
opposition — the government. They bring forward Bills 
whenever they see fit. And I can't believe that at this stage of 
the game we're going to get a lecture from the Minister of 
Finance, a first-time member of this House, about how we 
should conduct our affairs. Just like that. Don't ask me any 
questions because it isn't in my interest to answer them. And if 
you don't do like I say, I'll get somebody to bring in a rule 
change, and we'll make you sit here till midnight to get done 
what I want to do. 
 
You know that is really something else, Mr. Chairman. I've 
never seen that kind of an attitude exhibited before by a Finance 
minister. And I'm really wondering why members of the House 
then, we even bother coming here. I mean what's the point? We 
might as well have shut it down three months ago and said, let 
the Minister of Finance and her little kingdom run the province 
of Saskatchewan. 
 
Well it doesn't work that way. It never has. It never will. So, 
Madam Minister, the questions aren't difficult. They're 
something you deal with. You deal with your officials. I asked 
you a question about what you've decided in Treasury Board 
vis-a-vis, something that's under construction right now. Every 
person in this city drives by it daily, sees it and wonders. 
 
It isn't financed like other Crown corporations. It will not be 
talked about in Crown Corporations for a year and a half. By 
then it will either be a roaring success or a dog. 
 
And, Madam Chairman . . . Mr. Chairman, Madam Minister, I 
think it's just reasonable, when you bring in spending to this 
Assembly based on revenue projections as outlined in your 
budget, that we would want to ask questions about how you're 
going to meet that revenue projection with your spending. And 
part and parcel of that revenue projection is gambling. 
Gambling is big business in this province, tens of millions of 
dollars. 
 
Now I'm asking you about a very small part of that projection 
and the impact that it has on government spending. And I don't 
know why all I get in response is lectures and threats from the 
Minister of Finance. I mean, this could be dealt with so easily 
that it's unbelievable. And I don't understand why you don't 
want to answer the questions. It is under construction, Madam  



April 27, 1995 

 
1826 

Minister, and you are sinking a lot of taxpayers' money into the 
fulfilment of that construction — a lot of taxpayers' money. 
Why in the world you would not want to . . . because I mean if 
you weren't making those lease payments, the money would 
flow through, you know? 
 
We talked about that yesterday. Somebody else could have built 
the casino in its entirety, and you could have simply taxed it, 
okay? But you want to be part and parcel of owning the 
building, so why don't you want to answer the questions about 
what analysis you've come up with Treasury Board to support 
that thing downtown? I don't understand why that is so difficult. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, first of all I want to clarify. What I was saying to the 
member was not a threat. It was an offer. You have said you 
want to ask many more questions before you pass interim 
supply. You want to ask many more questions before you pass 
the budget. Fair enough. 
 
So I was saying, well there's two ways of doing this. We can 
pass interim supply and go on to estimates, and you can ask 
questions for as long as you want. Then the people of 
Saskatchewan get the money they require to continue their 
affairs. 
 
If for some reason it seems to you that it has to be interim 
supply, for whatever reason, that these questions can be asked 
— even though this is not the best place; I can't give you as 
much information as some other departments could that are 
responsible for these areas — prepared to, by mutual agreement 
of the House, to sit here as long as is required in order to ensure 
that you feel you've had every opportunity to ask every question 
that you want. 
 
Because what I'm saying is that our obligation is to try to ensure 
that whatever happens in this House and whatever is going on 
in here does not adversely affect the people of the province and 
that people who require money don't become the sacrificial 
victims of whatever this particular issue is about in the House. 
 
And again, as I say, I'm drawing circles because we're going 
around in circles. What I have said is that the casino is being 
built, developed by a private developer. The province will then 
pay a lease payment to that developer. There are no revenue 
projections in this budget for the casino, for reasons I explained 
to him yesterday. The casino agreement wasn't in place when 
this budget was put in place. 
 
As soon as we are in a position to say that there are revenues 
coming in and expenses going out, I can assure the member 
opposite that they will be informed as quickly as possible about 
that. And I can't . . . there is no other answer available. I do not 
have any other information to give him about this, so we just 
keep going. As I say, the problem with what he's saying is I 
have given him as much information as I am able to give him. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Let's keep it real simple then. Are you saying 
then that the analysis done by Treasury Board on this operation  

did not make any projections on financial viability of the 
casino? Is that what you're saying? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, no, I'm not saying 
that. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Okay, then that's out of the road. Treasury 
Board did make projections on the financial viability of the 
casino based on certain things. Okay. All I'm asking you is to 
give me the financial viability. I mean I'm just asking questions 
here on behalf of taxpayers who are wondering about how the 
thing is going to unfold. You won't budget anything. Okay. The 
member from Churchill Downs says it's four years down the 
road; you say, well maybe not. So all I'm asking you is, what is 
that financial viability look like. It's not difficult, Madam 
Minister. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, what I say to the 
member opposite — and you would know this because you've 
been in government — every piece of government analysis, 
especially when it affects a commercial venture and private 
sector partners, is out there in the market-place. It's not an issue 
within the Department of Finance. 
 
You cannot release all of this sort of information; it's simply not 
possible. But what I've made the commitment is when money is 
coming into the government, expenditures are going out, you 
will have that information released, so then you can scrutinize 
what is occurring. Beyond that, I'm sorry; I have nothing else to 
offer except what I've told you in the past. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — I wish — thank you, Mr. Chairman — 
Madam Minister, you hadn't tried hiding behind that 
commercial . . . I mean this is the only one, Madam Minister, 
and the government owns it. It's not like somebody in the 
private sector is running the operation. It's your buddy over here 
from Elphinstone that's the major-domo here — okay? 
 
And your partners in the endeavour are possibly going to build 
some more casinos on reserves, but you're it. I mean, there's 
nobody else you're competing with here. The machines are 
yours; you own them. The whole shebang is yours, so don't try 
and give me this commercial business because you've got a 
Crown here with a monopoly — okay? So give me a better 
excuse than that to hide behind why you don't want to give me 
those numbers. 
 
That one won't fly any further than the drop from my desk down 
to that floor. So you want to try again, that's fine. If you just 
simply don't want to answer, that it isn't in your political best 
interests, then I guess maybe that's where you better go. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, as I say, I don't want 
to keep going in a circle, and I'm always very reluctant to use a 
hypothetical because then all of a sudden the member comes 
back and says  aha! — so you've got a commitment here. 
 
But what I'm talking about is these sorts of considerations. If in 
fact you're building a building for me, and I'm going to lease it  



April 27, 1995 

 
1827 

from you, the amount of the lease payment that you might 
expect might vary according to whether I said I plan to make a 
billion dollars on that or I plan to make $100,000 on that. So 
there are many . . . and as I say, I want to clarify again; I'm 
talking totally hypothetically here. But this is what I'm talking 
about in terms of this being a different sort of transaction than a 
transaction within the Department of Finance or a particular 
department. 
 
What I have said to the member opposite, when there is a 
revenue flow and there are expenses coming under that revenue 
flow, you will have all of the details laid before you. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Madam Minister, we're not building 
7-Elevens on corners here. We're building the only casino in the 
province of Saskatchewan. And if you're telling me that you've 
got an open-ended lease with your contractor that says I'm 
going to get . . . depending on what the revenue stream is, I'm 
going to make my lease payments higher, boy, we really are in 
the glue then. Are you telling me that? That that's part of the 
deal? That as the revenue in the casino goes up, the revenue on 
the lease goes up? If it is, I want to get in the leasing business 
with you people. Is that what you're trying to tell me today? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, this proves my point. 
I said I am so reluctant to ever use a hypothetical with the 
member opposite because he comes back and he says, oh well, 
you've just said this. 
 
No, I did not know that what you asked me there is not true. So 
if you want a straight answer — no. 
 
Mr. Swenson: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Then, Madam 
Minister, just give me the straight answer. It's easy. It's not 
going to infringe on anybody else's commercial viability; it's the 
only casino in the province. We're not talking apartment 
buildings. We're not talking grocery stores. We're not talking 
gas stations. We're not talking government buildings. This is it, 
the only one. 
 
Now because it's the only one, you have a unique arrangement 
for it. You are into this arrangement, I suspect, because you 
think you're going to make money, and it's based on revenue 
projections that are going to meet the lease payments and pump 
money and sunshine into the liquor and gaming corporation. 
 
Why in the world you would not want to tell us about the good 
news, I don't know. I mean taxpayers need to know about a 
major investment in gambling in the province of Saskatchewan, 
downtown Regina, a building, the one and only. You say it has 
nothing to do with the lease arrangement; I accept your word. 
 
Tell us what, Madam Minister, the analyses show, and then the 
taxpayers of this province will be satisfied and relieved. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, I really have nothing 
to add beyond what I've said before to the member opposite to 
that question. 
 

Mr. Swenson: — Well as the rules of the place are, Mr. 
Chairman, I can't make the member answer the question. But 
obviously she's come down to the point where she says it is not 
in my political best interest or the government's political best 
interest to give the member from Thunder Creek information of 
why the government is spending . . . well the building is costing 
20 million-plus, so the lease has to cover off the 20 million plus 
the operating. And it's not in the taxpayers' best interest to 
understand why that money is being spent or how it's being 
spent, or what the projections are. 
 
And it's sad, Mr. Chairman, but that's where we are. She says, I 
will not talk about it any more because it's not in my political 
best interest or the political best interests of the New 
Democratic Party going into an election campaign to talk about 
those issues. 
 
(1600) 
 
It's sad, Madam Minister, it really is. I would have thought 
you'd want to trumpet those numbers from the highest heights 
because it's such a wonderful investment for us to be part of. 
And instead, you want to hide behind, I will not answer any 
more questions to that member on that issue — it's sad, Madam 
Minister — and then ask us to turn around, simply get out of 
your road and let you pass your interim supply Bill with 
millions of dollars involved. And we're supposed to trust you 
just like that when you won't answer simple questions around 
small amounts in the bigger scheme of things. 
 
Madam Minister, I raised the whole list of expenditures of the 
government earlier on in the questions, many of which impact 
on the monies that you are bringing forward. And there are all 
sorts of them that obviously will come out of funds that you're 
seeking from this Assembly. 
 
Can you tell us if the spending schedule of the government is 
on track two months after your budget? Because we don't have 
many opportunities to track that, vis-a-vis all of these 
expenditures and where they fit into a normal 12-month rotation 
of expenditures within government. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — What I would say to the member 
opposite, Mr. Chairman, is that we're less than one month into 
this budget and certainly we have nothing to change in terms of 
the spending estimates. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Minister, 
when you're asking for the two-twelfths of the year's budget, I'm 
wondering, because we have just recently heard about the 
union-preference tendering policy, and a lot of folks may not 
have been prepared for that, I'm wondering how many contracts 
would you estimate would fall into that area that would be 
affected by that policy? And how will that affect the total 
government expenditure under the request today for 
two-twelfths of the budget? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, I don't have that information here. As the member  



April 27, 1995 

 
1828 

opposite would know, that this is Crown Investments 
Corporation that has all of that detail. They can tell you in 
spades with many, many details as to how many agencies will 
be affected. And what I suggest is that you ask them that when 
they're here in estimates. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Well, Madam Minister, I didn't see anybody 
from CIC (Crown Investments Corporation of Saskatchewan) in 
here asking for two-twelfths of the budget to be approved 
without the scrutiny of the people and the people's 
representatives; I see you here. And so I think that it's your job 
and your responsibility to answer the question and to find out 
the information and to deliver it. 
 
That's why you have your officials with you, to help you to 
answer tough questions; otherwise why would we bother paying 
them wages to bring them along. And if they can't do their job 
maybe you better get some more and invite them to join in to 
this little exercise and start delivering some answers to the 
people of Saskatchewan about where you're spending 
two-twelfths of the total tax budget of this coming year. 
 
I don't think it's fair for you to dodge the question that way, so 
I'm going to repeat the question. Madam Minister, how will the 
union tendering policy that has just been brought into effect by 
your government over the past couple of months affect the total 
bill of the two-twelfths requirement of the budget that you're 
asking for? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, okay, I think I understand what he's saying here then. 
None of the Crown corporations that would be affected by the 
union tendering policies have any monies involved in the 
two-twelfths. So this interim supply that we're talking about has 
nothing to do with any of the agencies that would be affected by 
the tendering policy you're talking about. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Well, Madam Minister, I guess that is 
something we're just going to have to work on for a couple of 
minutes because that sounds like a highly irregular possibility. 
The budget for the year that you are asking the people of 
Saskatchewan to accept, I thought covered all government 
expenditures, 5.1 or $2 billion, whatever the total amount is, 
covers every department in government, I thought. I didn't think 
that there were any exemptions. 
 
And certainly it would seem to me that much of the work and 
the tendering done in affiliated government areas would be 
affected by this policy. For example, we see SGI contracts now 
that have had the union tendering policy applied to them, and of 
course, that is not a regular Crown corporation type of contract, 
as I understood it. 
 
And so it would seem that that policy has been applied through 
more than just the Crown sector. And as a result, there must be 
some costs to taxpayers associated with that policy. And I'm 
wondering where that is budgeted for and how much you've 
estimated that will cost in this two-twelfths now allocation? 
 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Again, I would say to the member 
opposite is there's nothing in here with respect to SGI, and as I 
mentioned in response to your colleague from Thunder Creek, 
that we have no changes to make in the estimates. Our budget is 
as presented. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you. Mr. Chairman, under the 
Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation, my 
understanding is that Saskatchewan Property Management 
Corporation does renovations to certain kinds of homes that are 
in their jurisdiction so that they can be leased out to people, 
basically on welfare, the underprivileged, and people on fixed 
incomes and that there's a formula for that. 
 
Those renovations would, of course, be contracted to 
contractors to do on a basis of need, I'm told. And does the 
union-preference tendering policy then not affect those 
contracts? And if so, how would that be built into an estimate 
of costs for the two-twelfths that you're asking for? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, what I would say to 
the member opposite is SPMC (Saskatchewan Property 
Management Corporation) has come forward with no changes 
in their budget, so there's no change from what we presented 
here. 
 
But again, this is the sort of detailed question which is much 
better asked of these departments or agencies when they come 
here in estimates. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Well, Mr. Chairman, I didn't have a chance to 
listen to all of the questions earlier, but I will point out to the 
minister that I did hear the member from Thunder Creek 
express concern that if an election were called before the budget 
were passed, that we would never have an opportunity on 
behalf of the taxpayers to ask any detailed questions of anyone. 
So the only opportunity that we may have to find out a few 
things about where the taxpayers' monies are going to be spent 
in the next several weeks, and maybe even months, would be 
this opportunity here and now. 
 
We are told that under the Saskatchewan Water Corporation 
there are four more pipelines that are being contemplated to be 
contracted out in the near future. These would be somewhat 
similar to the pipeline that was done at Melfort. So perhaps you 
could give me some idea as to whether these are . . . these 
contracts for these four new projects have been built into this 
budget and how they reflect in the two-twelfths of allocation 
that you're asking for at this time. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, I will give the 
member the same answer. There's been no change to the budget; 
nothing has been brought forward. And that's a very good 
question to be asking these agencies when they appear in 
estimates. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well I see we're 
going to get the classical run-around here, aren't we? And I 
guess, well, if you've got the whole day to waste of the  



April 27, 1995 

 
1829 

taxpayers' money, I suppose I'm getting paid by the day; I can 
afford to stay here too. 
 
Madam Minister, it seems to me that if you're asking the people 
of this province to trust you with two-twelfths of the budget 
without any questions or any debate, then those of us on this 
side would not be doing our jobs. And I hardly think that the 
people who have put us here would be very happy if we didn't 
at least try to get you to answer some of the questions that 
should be answered before you're allowed to spend 
two-twelfths of the total budget of this province without any 
accountability whatsoever. 
 
It appears, by your answers, where you basically are not 
answering any of the questions all afternoon. So how would 
you justify asking the people for two-twelfths of the budget if 
you're not prepared to answer questions on where the money is 
going to go? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Well, Mr. Chairman, what I would 
say to the member opposite is this. What we have here is the 
Department of Finance. We simply do not have with us the 
kinds of detailed information that the member opposite is 
requesting. But as I said to his colleague from Thunder Creek, 
the departments that have this information are ready, willing, 
and waiting outside to come in and do estimates so that they can 
get into these detailed issues and we can provide them with 
those sorts of answers, and that we can do this before the 
budget is passed. 
 
And what I would say to the member opposite as well, we 
introduced the budget on February 16 — the earliest budget in 
Canada — to ensure that they had ample opportunity through 
the normal process to ask these sorts of questions. What's at 
stake here is something quite different. Who is going to suffer if 
interim supply doesn't pass aren't the members here — not you, 
not us. It's going to be people out there in this province who 
provide services like transition homes for abused women who 
are not going to have the money to run their budgets. 
 
So what we have said to you and your colleague is, we are 
prepared to move to estimates so you can ask all these detailed 
questions, get your answers, or we're prepared to have the hours 
of the legislature extended well into the morning so that you 
can ask every possible question you want and pass interim 
supply. 
 
But when we inform the people tomorrow that their money will 
not be coming, we will be showing that this side of the House 
made every reasonable effort possible and was willing to do 
everything to compromise to ensure that they got their money. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Minister, 
you can tell the people anything you like, because you're a 
politician and they'll take it for what it's worth. And I don't 
particularly care what you tell them. Because the truth of the 
matter is that until you answer some questions about where 
you're going to be spending a couple of billion dollars and how 
you're planning on using that money, we have no intentions of  

letting you get off with simply giving us lectures about how 
we're asking the wrong questions or detailed questions or 
anything else. I've got my flat shoes on, and if you want to stay 
here until 4 o'clock in the morning, that's fine and dandy with 
me. 
 
Under Municipal Government, I see that you have the estimates 
of one hundred and ninety-eight point zero zero three eight. I 
don't know if those are points or if they're commas. But that is 
under your estimates. 
 
Now it says here that you're asking for a two-twelfths 
proportion, which . . . I think maybe I'll just let you explain that 
for yourself. 
 
Of the Municipal Government budget, what percentage are you 
asking for now? Is it the full two-twelfths? Or are there any 
additions to the two-twelfths or is it a simple two-twelfths? Or 
have you allowed for some of the emergency funds for the 
flooding to municipalities in that area? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — We are requesting a straight 
two-twelfths across the board for all departments. 
 
(1615) 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, Madam 
Minister, the other day the Minister of Municipal Government 
announced in the papers — we have copies here — that in fact 
she was going to be providing help for rural municipalities who 
were blasted with unusual weather conditions. The Premier is 
even talking about an emergency fund requirement from the 
federal government. Now how could she make that kind of an 
announcement without some contingency play to pay off the 
extra monies that she obviously has to be promising? 
 
When this budget was drawn up, it had to have been done 
during December or January or February — in that period of 
time. You brought the budget in pretty well before any snow 
melted whatsoever. The heaviest snows we've had have been 
towards the end of March, and into April we've had snow and 
rain. There was no anticipation of extreme flooding, and 
nobody told us anything about any guesstimations that there 
was going to be anything like the kind of problems we had. So I 
saw nothing built into the budget as a contingency plan for any 
flooding any place in the province or any kind of damage to 
crop lands that might not be seeded. And all those kinds of 
contingency things never were considered in the budget, that I 
could see. 
 
So if they were never considered in the budget at that time, then 
now how do you propose to pay the bills for those things that 
you're promising? You've got a Minister of Municipal 
Government saying to the municipalities, we're going to help 
you, and we're going to give you money. So where is that 
money going to come from? 
 
It can't be coming out of the budget because you didn't budget 
for it. You didn't have any contingency plans for any kinds of  



April 27, 1995 

 
1830 

bad weather or floods. A little while ago I heard you say you 
never make those kind of plans. You never worry about the 
future in terms of disasters. You only cope with them as they 
happen. And if they happen, then you have a plan — not quite 
the way most people live their lives in our world, fortunately. 
 
But that's your plan, and that's your position, and you're 
welcome to it. I hope we don't have to live that way for ever. 
But the reality is now that you've got these promises made. So if 
you're not asking for more than two-twelfths, how are you 
going to pay for the commitment that this minister has to those 
people out in rural Saskatchewan? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Well, Mr. Chairman, it looks like 
the members opposite really are not interested in passing 
interim supply, so perhaps it's time for a little bit of straight talk 
in this legislature. 
 
What I would like the people of Saskatchewan to ask the 
member opposite is what is going on on that side of the House? 
Was he really, when his colleague was up here asking exactly 
those questions and getting answers for about half an hour — 
maybe an hour — on exactly that point, was he really off 
somewhere not listening to this? Was he daydreaming, not 
listening? Or do they not have any other questions to ask, so 
they just keep recycling the questions? 
 
But I will say to the member opposite, I went through this for at 
least a half an hour with your colleagues. If in fact you're going 
to be in this legislature, trying to delay the passage of money for 
groups out there, please at least try to come up with different 
questions. Please don't share questions. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Minister. Well as a matter of fact, 
I heard your answers to some extent earlier, as you alluded, and 
you want to talk straight talk. I never heard a straight answer. 
As a matter of fact, I haven't heard a straight answer yet today. 
All I've heard is you beating around the bush and playing 
politics with a very important segment of the taxpayers' dollar, 
which is the cost of running this Assembly. 
 
Now we're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to keep 
this place operating and you haven't given anybody one straight 
answer about anything. You just got up and said that, well you 
asked the same question. Well we didn't get the answer the first 
time, we didn't get it the second time; we rephrased the question 
to allow you to have time to think it over. And because we 
thought that maybe you'd need a little more time to think your 
way through it to come up with the answer because you didn't 
seem to have the right officials here, we thought maybe if we 
talked about something else for awhile, you might have time to 
send somebody out to the back door and invite another official 
in that could come up with the right answers. So we asked some 
other questions for awhile. 
 
Now we've hoped that you'd come up with the right officials 
that have the answers and we asked the question again so that 
you'd have an opportunity to tell the people of Saskatchewan 
where you're spending their money and how in fact you're  

going to deliver the services that your ministers are all 
promising, when in fact you haven't budgeted for it. 
 
And you're saying in this list here that you're asking for a 
straight two-twelfths but you don't have any allocation for the 
funds extra that you're promising. I also heard you dodge the 
question on how the $6 million is going to be paid to the 
Highways. 
 
Incidentally, Minister, I just had occasion, while you were busy 
not answering any questions today, to look at some pictures that 
were taken of the flood area, and they're very interesting. You 
should take a look at them yourself. They happen to have been 
taken by one of your members so it should be easy for you to 
access. 
 
Fact of the matter is, Minister, that while the Premier needed to 
promise people some money in order to comfort them while 
they're in the middle of a flood, from the pictures I've seen 
today, $6 million quite frankly is never going to do the job. It's 
going to take quite a lot more money than that to fix up the 
highways and the roads that are being destroyed in this province 
at this very moment, and have been destroyed over the past 
three weeks. 
 
But you've only made a commitment of 6 million in that initial 
forecast, but you haven't told us where you're going to get that 
money from. I never heard any straight answers about how 
you're going to budget for that money; who's going to pay for it. 
 
Now you're going to try and tell us that people are going to go 
out there and start working in two or three weeks now, building 
these roads, and wait for two or three months to be paid? Give 
me break. People don't work that way in society any more. 
They've got 30-day deadlines just like everybody else has. 
 
And if you're going to ask road crews to go to work, start 
rebuilding highways, and you're going to have people out 
running graders, maintaining roads and things like that and 
extra projects of putting in broken bridges and that kind of 
stuff, don't tell me that you're not going to be able . . . or have to 
pay them for two or three months down the road into 
summertime sometime. That's just not the way it works. You're 
either going to pay them in 30 days or they're going to walk off 
the job and leave the province. 
 
That's as simple as that, because they can't get any more than 
30-day credit buying their fuel and hiring their men and women 
and the people that they employ and all of the things that go 
into the process of running road equipment and building crews 
and all that kind of stuff. 
 
So you have to come up with some answers on where the 
money's going to come from. And you know very well that you 
have to provide that money. And you haven't done that because 
you just thought that you were going to throw this document 
together in about a half an hour, whip it out on a printing 
machine and throw it around the legislature; we'd all come in  



April 27, 1995 

 
1831 

here and say, grand job you did there, let's all pass this thing 
and let the minister carry on, and be like the used car salesman, 
and trust her to do everything right. 
 
Well, Minister, you've asked for too much. You've already gone 
through this process once this year. You've had interim supply 
on one occasion already. Now you're asking for it again and 
you're asking for it in double the amounts, and you're not 
allowing for any contingency plans for the promises that your 
own ministers are out in the country making — contingency 
plans of extra expenditures that have to be paid for. 
 
If you follow through with the projects that you say you're 
going to follow through with, there's absolutely no question in 
my mind but that you're going to have to start to pay people. 
And if you don't start to pay the people, they're not going to 
work for you. And you know that, so you have to budget for it. 
 
So what are you going to do? Are you going to start picking one 
pocket to put it into the other pocket? Are you going to 
download this onto the municipalities and force them to pay the 
contractors? Are you going to force the Department of 
Highways to start borrowing money and run a deficit on the 
interim and pay interest? What would be the plan to pay off 
these people that you're promising that you're going to give all 
this work to, to fix up all these projects? 
 
I don't think, Minister, that simply saying that you're not going 
to do it until later, or that you're just going to talk about it in 
some other process of the government, is fair. I just don't think 
that's fair to the taxpayers. I don't think it's fair to the people 
that you're talking about employing. 
 
How would you suggest that we would convince anybody to 
come up to the North with a bunch of graders and a bunch of 
U-Hauls or Terexes and big heavy earth-moving equipment? 
How would you expect to attract them to come up there and do 
the work or to take a contract from you to fix those things? 
 
How would you hire a bridge crew if they were to read the 
Hansard today and find out that there's no contingency plan to 
pay them? That there is no money available because you haven't 
included it in your estimates for the two-twelfths, plus what you 
will need to pay them. If you haven't provided some mechanism 
for them to get paid, why would they trust you? Why would 
they come and work for you? Those are all the questions that 
you have to answer for us if you're not willing to answer for us 
where the money is and how you're going to pay for it. 
 
If you're not willing to tell us how you're going to pay for it, 
then at least tell us how you're going to convince people to 
work for you without any money available. How are you going 
to attract folks to bid on contracts when they think they might 
never get paid? 
 
Or is this sort of another one of them deals like Melfort where 
you had pipeline and it sprinkles water all over, and people in 
the community all get hung out to dry, trying to collect the bills  

from the things that are charged up at their different businesses 
and nobody ever pays them. 
 
Is that the kind of a government you're going to run throughout 
the entire province where you have contractors that have to 
have equipment and materials, and when they go to buy them 
they're never paid, so in turn their suppliers never get paid? 
How are you going to attract those kind of people to come in 
and do the jobs if there is no money? 
 
If I were to read Hansard today, there's no way, as a 
businessman, that I would ever take on a contract with this 
government to go into that flood area because you've made no 
allocation to pay them. And if you don't have any allocation to 
pay them, then I don't think they're going to want to work. I 
wouldn't. Why would you? I can't see this. 
 
So, Minister, where in the world is the comfort zone for these 
folks that you're planning on taking into that area? Is there any 
place in this document at all that gives anybody any kind of 
comfort or assurance that you're going to pay them when they 
come in to do these projects? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, as I said to his colleague, we will manage within the 
existing budget. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Well thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, Madam 
Minister, I don't believe you, quite frankly. I see Madam 
Minister has turned the matter over to her colleague, so the new 
minister of Finance, maybe we'll get somewhere now. 
 
And how are you going to manage the affairs of providing 
money so that people can be comforted to know that they can 
get paid to do the work in the flood zone that the Premier and 
the Minister of Municipal Affairs has promised in the past 
couple of weeks? 
 
There's no funding available in this document that I have 
received here, interim supply. All it is is the two-twelfths 
allocation that has been asked for to run the ordinary 
budgeted-for projects of the province. 
 
So, Mr. Minister, where is there some indication that people 
that are hired to clean up the mess of the floods will in fact be 
able to be paid? 
 
Hon. Mr. Shillington: — I have a certain sense of déjà vu. 
When I was here Wednesday dealing with these issues, these 
same questions seemed to arise. And you got the answers then 
and I can only repeat the answers. 
 
In any budget there is some items which you will overexpend 
and some items which you will underexpend. You try to avoid 
that but that is not always possible. What one must do is to 
manage within the total envelope. And so we may be 
overexpending in the area of Highways in this problem. Some 
time later on we'll have a bit of luck, we'll make up for it. 
 



April 27, 1995 

 
1832 

We have, over the last four years, done an admirable job; so say 
the professional bankers and so on. We've done an admirable 
job of managing. I'm certain these very competent officials in 
the Department of Finance will be able to manage within the 
total budget. 
 
You ask us specifically where it is going to come from; where 
will the underexpenditures be? We of course don't know that. 
We do know from experience they do arise, and that sums of 
money of this nature are manageable. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Minister, I've 
been listening with some interest and I got the feeling that 
Madam Minister was finding it, if you will, a little annoying to 
have to sit and try to answer questions on her interim supply. 
And the part that amazes me . . . and of course the present 
associate minister, who is now taking the chair and is 
attempting to answer the questions, I know is quite well aware 
of interim supply and the debate that can take place. And 
certainly the deputy minister has been involved in the past as 
well, and as in an office when it comes to this type of debate 
and the questions that arise. 
 
And many times, and I can remember even when the present 
minister sat on this side of the House and the types of questions 
and the information that the then opposition member, now the 
associate minister, would arise and endeavour or felt that was 
important that questions that were raised of matters of 
importance such as . . . There's no doubt in my mind that the 
flood in north-eastern or eastern Saskatchewan right now would 
not be uppermost in the member's mind if he was here asking 
the questions and how that project would be financed. And so 
it's interesting to know how sometimes the tables change, and 
when you're trying to determine where the allocation of funding 
is going. 
 
(1630) 
 
Now the Premier announced the other day that there will be $6 
million, or at least he's made a promise of $6 million. And I'm 
not exactly sure how that . . . we've been trying to determine 
how that is actually allocated. The minister keeps telling us, 
well that's not really in this portion of interim supply, or there's 
no real allocation of the 6 million. It's just part of the overall 
budget that eventually, once roads are refurbished or 
reconstruction of roads or reconstruction of some of the damage 
takes place and the costs associated with are tabulated, that that 
funding will be placed forward and . . . or the requests will 
come for funding. 
 
And I guess the question I would have, and I think my 
colleagues have had all along, is, as a Finance minister and as 
your department looks at this when the Premier goes out and 
makes an announcement, or if it were you, Madam Minister, 
you must have some idea prior to making an announcement 
where you're going to find these funds. And I think the minister 
or the Premier indicated that he was also hopeful that the 
federal government would come across with some funds. 
 

Now whether it's directly coming out of this interim supply or 
this request for funding is irrelevant, I think part of that portion 
is or may come out of this to this two months supply that you've 
asked for. You've called for two months and I'm not sure if it's 
part of what that will be — if that's Municipal Government that 
directs that issue or if part of it's Highways because of the 
Highways estimate. But at the end of the day, Madam Minister, 
where do you find the funds? 
 
In determining the $6 million, is that something that you're 
going to find extra funds out of the blue, or are you going to 
reallocate funding to other departments to pick up this promise 
of $6 million? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask the 
member opposite a question. If I give this answer to yet the 
third member of the Tory caucus, would he promise to tell the 
rest? Or do I have to go through each one of you so that I 
actually have to go through this 10 different times? 
 
I'll try it once again and, as I say, I'll try it on the condition that 
the member opposite will explain it to the other seven so that 
we don't spend all of the time in the legislature with the same 
answer 10 different times. My fear is after the next election we 
won't have to worry about that. 
 
What I said to your colleague from Thunder Creek was this. 
When we do our budgeting, we say look, here's the amount of 
money that we're going to spend this year, and here's some of 
the estimates that we have about costs. In a budget of $4 billion 
there are certain things that . . . costs that you expected to be 
there that aren't there. 
 
It's like I say, it's like a household. You set aside a certain 
amount of money for car repairs; your car doesn't break down 
— oh, that's great. And if you manage your finances well, you 
take the money for the car repairs that you didn't need and you 
apply it to something that happened that you didn't expect to 
happen, that you do need money. 
 
So what we've said to the municipalities out there is yes, this is 
a situation wasn't anticipated; do you have a problem? You do 
need our help; we're willing to give you this help. And we've 
said that the departments within the government will find this 
money by redirecting savings in other areas. 
 
And I'll try that this one time and hope that this satisfies your 
complaints; otherwise I'm going to get it xeroxed and sent 
across so that you can hand it around to each of the members, 
because I'm sure this must be at least the 10th time that I've 
gone through that particular explanation. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Well I thank you, Madam Minister, for having 
offered that explanation and I think it basically relates to the 
question I asked about the fact, at the end of the day, where do 
you intend to find emergency funds such as the promise that 
was just made, and the fact that . . . 
 
Like I guess the concern we have, the concern I have, is what  



April 27, 1995 

 
1833 

contingency plans are in place when you address funding? Now 
you've said yes, you estimate what you may expend through the 
next year, and you estimate what will be spent by a department. 
But as we've already seen, we're facing a situation in 
north-eastern Saskatchewan where there will be substantial 
dollars in reconstruction of road and road surfaces. And 
certainly a portion of the funding that will be needed to 
compensate people for loss will come through insurance, which 
will have no bearing on our discussion here today. And that will 
take place. 
 
But as well, Madam Minister, there's another problem looming 
and I'm not sure if any of my colleagues have raised it, and that 
problem is the fact that there may be many people across this 
province . . . I shouldn't say across the province, but in the 
eastern part of the province, are going to find themselves in a 
position where the availability . . . or land available for crop 
production is going to be greatly diminished. And you may find 
that there's a farming community out there that is certainly 
going to need some help or some assistance or some assurances 
that as a government . . . whether they're the farm community, 
whether they're the small businesses in the communities of 
Langenburg or MacNutt or the Canoras of this world, that they 
will be looking to you. 
 
And certainly we can look back over what's taken place over the 
last few years, areas where your government has decided that it 
was more important to change the rules versus honouring 
contracts. And one has to wonder what kind of a commitment 
there will be to try and offset some of the losses that will be 
incurred by many people, due to the excessive water and the 
flooding that has taken place and is continuing to take place. 
 
And unfortunately, I understand by the news that there is a 
weather advisory up in that Yorkton-Quill Lakes area again 
today, with the possibility of . . . I shouldn't say possibility, I 
guess they are actually getting more snow on the way, which 
just adds to the problems they face. 
 
And so while we sit here in the Legislative Assembly and we 
may complain about the fact that the sun isn't shining, it would 
be nice to see some warm weather, there's people in 
north-eastern Saskatchewan at this present time fighting to save 
property. But not only that, wondering where they will be this 
fall in trying to pay their bills because of the lack of opportunity 
even to possibly put that crop in the ground. 
 
And what that's going to do is not only place individuals 
looking to government for some help or some means of helping 
them through the next winter but, Madam Minister, it also 
affects your budget in the fact that there will be a number of 
acres that will not have a crop this year, a number of acres that 
will not produce, another number of acres that will not generate 
revenue. And what contingency plans have your government or 
department put into place to address circumstances such as 
what we were seeing and what may arise due to the flooding 
situation in north-eastern Saskatchewan? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — I didn't quite understand the gist of  

what he was saying. Would he mind repeating that question? 
 
Mr. Toth: — I guess, Madam Minister, if you pay attention and 
listen, you might understand. What I was basically asking, 
Madam Minister — and I think we've asked this before; we're 
still waiting for a direct answer — is what contingency plans 
does the government, working with the department officials, 
have in place to address emergency circumstances? 
 
You stood up in the Chamber this afternoon and bragged about 
balancing the books and balancing your budget, but at the end 
of the day, even when I listened to your presentation of the 
balanced budget that you presented back in, I believe it was 
around the end of February, there wasn't anything in your 
budget address to indicate that there was some contingency 
plans in place to address any emergency circumstances that may 
arise that may affect the bottom line of your budget. 
 
And that's the question I'm asking, Madam Minister. If there are 
any contingency plans, what your plans are, how do you plan to 
address it. And in the overall scheme of things, versus the 
two-twelfths you're calling for today through this interim 
supply, how you address the emergencies that arise. 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, the answer is the 
same as I gave to his colleague and his other colleague, and 
maybe another colleague. And that is that we will manage this 
within the confines of the budget and that when another 
situation arises that isn't anticipated, we will develop 
appropriate funds. 
 
Mr. Toth: — I guess that's the concern we have, Madam 
Minister, is when you talk about we'll manage, you haven't 
really . . . the interesting thing, and I'm coming back to some of 
the discussion we've had even in Crown Corporations and just 
recently with the Provincial Auditor's office. 
 
And the Provincial Auditor has indicated that you lay out some 
guidelines, some plans, as to where you hope to be 12 months 
down the road, as your budget is presented today and where it 
is. And if there are some little kinks that may arise or some little 
areas, emergency situations that come up on the chart and your 
Richter scale it jumps, how do you address it? Do you have any 
plans in place that would address emergency situations such as 
we see in the Langenburg area, or emergency situations that 
may arise because of the flooding up in that north-east sector 
that may arise? They may not be there today, but will be there 
two or three months down the road. 
 
And while I guess you're hoping and trusting that people will 
have faith in you and believe that you can manage it, it seems to 
me the auditor has indicated that it certainly is good to have a 
management plan out in front so that we can, as an opposition, 
and the people of this province can, at the end of day look back 
and say, well, here the government did have a plan in place. 
Yes, the government presented a budget to the province and to 
the people of Saskatchewan as to what they were going to 
expend. 
 



April 27, 1995 

 
1834 

The budget indicated what they anticipated to receive . . . in 
receiving as far as revenues so that they would be able to meet 
their budget commitments, and this is how they were going to 
do it. And do you really have a plan in place, or is it just a 
matter of managing on a daily basis as emergencies arise? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Yes. Yes, we do have a plan in 
place. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Yes, we're just managing by the seat of our pants. 
Is that what it was, Madam Minister? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — We do have a plan in place and the 
member opposite knows that. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Madam Minister, you're calling for, I believe, in 
this interim supply Bill some $260 million in the area of Health. 
And as I view that . . . and a number of concerns . . . and we 
raised a couple concerns just this past, the past two days, with 
regards to individuals and some of the problems that they've 
faced in the area of Health. 
 
When you call for an expenditure of two-twelfths, in view of 
the fact that we have, I believe it's 23 district health boards, is 
there an allotment that . . . of this 260 million, what amount 
would be allocated directly to district health boards? Do you 
have any of that information available? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, again this is the kind of question that . . . we don't 
have this sort of detail here because what you're asking us is all 
of the departments of government. You're asking us for detailed 
information about all of them. And if we had the information 
here, this whole room would be full of boxes. 
 
So what we're saying is that when the Department of Health is 
here, they can certainly tell you what percentage of that money 
is going to the district boards. You could also look in the 
budget and find out what percentage of the spending in the 
Department of Health goes to the district boards and it'll be 
two-twelfths of that particular amount. 
 
But the point I keep trying to make again and again with the 
members opposite — what we're talking about here is interim 
supply, which is just the money required for those agencies out 
there so they can continue their operations. 
 
We do not have the capacity to give you detailed answers here. 
There's another process which you can activate in two seconds, 
if you want, which is you bring the departments in and they 
have all the details and they would be more than pleased to 
answer all of these questions. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Well, thank you, Madam Minister. And we look 
forward to ongoing debate in this Assembly as we sit down 
with the different departments and hopefully work together with 
the minister or the member or the House Leader as to when the 
departments will come forward. 
 

An Hon. Member: — Well then why don't you get on with it, 
for God's sakes? 
 
Mr. Toth: — But it's interesting, the member from 
Lloydminster says, why don't we get on it. Well we've been 
talking to the House Leader, we've been asking for certain 
departments to come forward. And yet when we ask for them 
we're told one day that this certain department will come 
forward. By the time we come to the House the next day and 
we're ready for the debate on that department, then all of a 
sudden we find we've got another department in front of us or 
we've got a Bill in front of us. 
 
And obviously the member from Lloydminster really doesn't 
know how this House operates. She certainly has a lot to offer 
from her seat but she didn't have the time to go and talk to her 
own constituents about a concern that they have on their minds 
at this present time. And maybe it would be appropriate if the 
minister took that time to address those concerns. 
 
But that has nothing to do with interim supply. So we'll get 
back to interim supply . . . 
 
An Hon. Member: — Don't you ever question my ability to 
represent my constituency. You keep your own nose clean. 
 
Mr. Toth: — The interesting part, Mr. Chairman, there's 
enough people in that Lloydminster riding who would question 
the member's ability to represent her constituency. 
 
But getting back to the debate here, when you're allocating your 
funding and calling for your interim supply and asking for two 
months' interim supply, basically then am I understanding . . . or 
what you're saying, Madam Minister, as a department or as a 
Finance department, basically what you're doing is just coming 
to the Legislative Assembly without really taking the time to 
seek information from the different departments as to the 
allocation that is needed. Or do you just automatically assume 
that one-twelfth is all they will use? To me, like, if you were to 
look at the Department of Highways, they wouldn't necessarily 
need a large allocation come November, December, January, 
February; their allocation would be heavier during the summer 
months. 
 
And so do you just take the time to just address one-twelfth 
without reviewing what the departments need in general? And 
maybe there is an expense that is incurring, say, through the 
months of May and June, especially in highway construction, 
that would be more appropriate; where you would indeed 
allocate a little more of the Highways’ funding right now versus 
just the two-twelfths? 
 
(1645) 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite, this is standard practice in government. This has 
occurred ever since when you were in power, when we were in 
power before, when the Liberals were in power. 
 



April 27, 1995 

 
1835 

What you do is you say each and every department gets 
one-twelfth, or if it's two months, two-twelfths of their budget, 
to allow them to continue to operate until the budget is passed. 
It's an interim measure. 
 
You know the member opposite really shouldn't get into the 
level of preparation. We've been standing here for hour after 
hour. We've been talking about one of the most important 
budgets in Saskatchewan's history — a balanced budget that has 
tax cuts involved, that has major expenditures in Health — and 
what we dealt with are about two or three topics. 
 
And the members are sharing questions; that is, they're coming 
in and they're asking the questions that the previous members 
asked. 
 
So what we are prepared to do is to discuss the budget in 
overarching way. If they want to get into details, they know 
very well there's another process which they can activate right 
away which is the estimates, and they can then get the proper 
people in here to answer their detailed questions. 
 
Mr. Toth: — Madam Minister, whether they're detailed or not, 
there are certainly questions that are out there and that 
individuals have, as well as ourselves in opposition. 
 
One would have to ask at the present time, Madam Minister, 
while you're allocating funds and allocating expenditures, what 
do you have right now to show where does this revenue come 
from and the allocation of the funds? Does your revenue come 
on a one-twelfth basis to the department so that you can allocate 
these funds, or how do you arrive at the . . . where do you get 
the revenue or find the revenue right now to meet that 
two-twelfths commitment? How are you finding that revenue? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, I'll certainly do my 
best to get back to some of the basics here to answer that 
question. Money keeps coming in to the government even 
though the budget hasn't been passed. That is, taxes are still 
collected in the province, and sales tax and income tax money 
just keeps coming in. So certainly the money is available. 
 
And so what we do is . . . because the budget isn't passed, the 
year end has occurred, March 31. We're into the new budget 
year. We need to be able to give money to these groups, so they 
can continue their operations. And what has been standard 
practice in the past is you just automatically give them 
one-twelfth or two-twelfths. And as I say, it's been standard. It 
doesn't mean they're forced to spend one-twelfth or 
two-twelfths. If they don't need that money they won't spend it 
obviously. 
 
But I'm going to get back to my main point. I have just been 
informed by the Department of Finance that there will be 
agencies that will not get money before Wednesday, and they 
will require that money before that date. So I will say to the 
members opposite, if they are not going to pass this legislation 
today, what we will be telling these agencies is the money is not 
forthcoming because the opposition will not pass interim  

supply. This means money going to transition homes for abused 
women, group homes for children and youth, group homes for 
mentally handicapped adults, sexual assault centres. 
 
And we will tell them as well that we made every effort. That 
is, we've said if they have questions, we're willing to move into 
estimates, allow them to ask their questions there. We're willing 
to extend the hours of the House if that's what they'd like. But 
we made every effort on our part to ensure that this money 
would get to them as soon as possible. Unfortunately, 
depending on what happens in the next ten minutes, we will 
have to say that their money simply won't be there on time and 
that they need to address that with you. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The comments 
from the minister become stranger and weirder because I 
thought we were supposed to work tomorrow too. 
 
And I thought that the last time that you came to this Assembly 
asking for money without any explanations towards the end of 
March, you said, we'll need interim supply for the month of 
April, and we're just going to have to pay all these folks. So we 
won't have our budget passed. So you guys be good now and 
don't ask too many questions, and let us pay the folks and pass 
this. And we did that. We were very cooperative with you. You 
were only here a matter of a few minutes, and we said okay, go 
ahead, carry on the first month, and we'll ask you these 
important questions next month. 
 
But of course, you just are making us look foolish because what 
you're saying is that now I'm not going to answer any questions. 
I didn't have to answer any last time, so I'm not going to answer 
any this time either. They'll get tired after awhile and go home 
and let me away with whatever I want to do. 
 
Well, Madam Minister, that's not the way it works in this 
Assembly. We gave you a break last time in good faith, and 
now we expect you in good faith to answer some questions. 
 
So my question is very simply this. We gave you a one-twelfth 
proportion of the budget last month. We passed that; we gave it 
to you. Is that money all spent up, every thin dime, as of the end 
of this month? Is every dime gone? 
 
Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: — Mr. Chairman, to the member 
opposite. First of all, I want to clarify what was said last time. 
What we have said consistently is there is a process in the 
parliamentary system whereby detailed questions can be asked 
and answered, and that's the estimates. And last time we said 
that, and we're saying the same this time. 
 
It would be absolutely impossible to determine whether or not 
all the money was spent because, first of all, we haven't reached 
the end of the month, and this will vary from department to 
department. 
 
The members opposite may not realize a piece of information 
that my department has just provided me. We require four days 
in order to process the funds that are going out. So I mean you

are really putting yourselves in the position where groups are 
not going to have the money they require in order to continue 
their operations. And I hope that you have for them a very good 
explanation because what I will be saying to them, as I said to 
the opposition . . . 
 
Two things  we're prepared to move on to estimates 
immediately so that these same questions can be asked in that 
format, exactly the same questions. Or we're prepared to extend 
hours and to sit here as long as you would like to sit here 
tonight so that you could ask as many questions as possible. 
And we're prepared to do that because we're not prepared to 
allow the innocent groups out there to become pawns in 
whatever this particular game happens to be. So it's really up to 
you to decide what your answer is, but I can tell you that that is 
what we will be saying to these different agencies. 
 
And you have to understand — we have forewarned you — it 
takes four days to go through the different processes that have 
to go through to get this money from this legislature through the 
processes out to those people. 
 
Mr. Goohsen: — Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, Madam 
Minister, I asked you a very simple and, I think, fair question. I 
asked you, did you spend the one-twelfth of the money that we 
gave you the last time you came to this Assembly and asked for 
interim supply for one month? We gave it to you without any 
commotion whatsoever, on good faith that we would let you do 
it so that you could run the affairs of the government. 
 
And then we said we will next time get into more detail and 
hold you accountable because that's fair ball; that gives you 
enough time in the new budgetary process. You've had that 
time. Now you're trying to take advantage of us, and you're 
trying to take advantage of the taxpayers. You're trying to take 
advantage of our good nature because of course you're going to 
try to tell people that some folks might not be able to get paid. 
 
Well we know that that is just purely nonsense. It's not going to 
happen that way. You know that as well as I do. Anybody that 
needs help is going to get it. Nobody's going to be 
short-changed. There won't be any people left starving to death 
on the streets as a result of our having an opportunity to have 
grievance before supply — an ancient tradition, a parliamentary 
process that you and your government seems to have forgotten 
about. You seem to have forgotten that there are ancient 
traditions that go with the democratic process and that we, as an 
official opposition, have a responsibility to hold you 
accountable, and accountable means that we have grievance 
before supply. 
 
That's the old adage that is written in every history book that 
you will ever read when you look for definitions and 
explanations of how the democratic process should work and 
how the people's money should be accounted for and spent. 
There's no exception to that tradition, except in dictatorships 
and those kinds of administrations. 
 
In democratic government and in democratic process, grievance  

before supply is always an honoured tradition, and ministers 
have never been let away with saying people are going to starve 
to death on the streets if you don't give us the money by passing 
interim supply by a certain such a date and hour, especially after 
we've let you away with one month's supply already without any 
questions whatsoever; just on good faith, we trusted you as the 
minister. And trust can only go so far, Madam Minister. And 
we let you know that fairly and squarely when we let you off 
last time. 
 
Now today, we spent all this time trying to find out simple little 
questions like, did you spend all the money that we gave you 
last month? And you don't know. Obviously you don't know if 
you spent one-twelfth of your money. You know, if I had a 
child who was on an allowance and they couldn't even tell me if 
they spent all their allowance from last month or not, there's no 
way I'd give them another allowance because you surely can 
look in your pocket to see if it's empty or not. I mean, how hard 
is it to tell that the money is gone or not gone. This can't be a 
really difficult problem. 
 
Madam Minister, what are you trying to cover up here? What is 
going on with this government? What kind of tricks are you 
trying to pull on the taxpayers of this province? This doesn't 
look fair, and it doesn't look to me like you're trying to be fair 
with the people of Saskatchewan. 
 
You've run us around all afternoon, wasted our time. We've 
asked you simple, honest questions like, did you spend the 
one-twelfth of your money. And you won't even answer that 
simple question. Now how tragic a minister can you be, not 
even to answer a simple, honest little question like, did you 
spend the money from last month? You don't know if you spent 
it or not; I think that's the problem. You are incompetent and 
don't know what you're doing. You haven't told the people of 
this province one thing today that matters in the scheme of 
things, except to throw out idle threats about how you're going 
to destroy the reputation of the opposition because they stood 
around and asked questions. 
 
Well let me tell you, this happens to be our job, and at least we 
know enough to do it. And we've asked you several times to be 
honest with the people of this province, and you neglect your 
duty, and you neglect your responsibility, and we are going to 
hold you accountable going into this election for not telling the 
taxpayers where you spend their money or how you plan to 
spent it. But don't try to get away with saying that you can 
spend just an ordinary one-twelfth each month because that's 
not the way it works. We know very well that in the Department 
of Highways, construction work comes in the . . . and the 
minister . . . 
 
The Chair:  Order. It now being near the hour of 5 o’clock 
the Committee of Finance will now rise, report progress, and 
ask for leave to sit again. 
 
The committee reported progress. 
 
The Assembly adjourned at 4:59 p.m.
