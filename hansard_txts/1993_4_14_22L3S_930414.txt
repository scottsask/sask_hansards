Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I have a 

long series of people who have signed this petition, Mr. 

Speaker, and to read the petition so that the people can 

understand what it's about. I would like to read the petition 

which says thus: 

 

To the Honourable Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan 

. . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. I think the member knows that 

he can only read the prayer of the petition — only the prayer of 

the petition. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 

The Speaker: — I've made my ruling and the member can 

only read the prayer of the petition. 

 

If the member doesn't proceed I will call on another member. 

The member from Rosthern, read the prayer of the petition. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. The 

petition is coming from Eatonia, simply states the prayer: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 

Honourable Assembly may be pleased to postpone 

consideration of the health districts so that communities 

may continue their efforts to organize their people and have 

a genuine impact on the process without intimidation or 

threat of arbitrary action by the government. 

 

 And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, and members of the legislature, this petition 

has lots of dates on it and lots of names, Mr. Speaker, and they 

come from communities surrounding Eatonia and from within 

Eatonia itself. And as they have requested me to do, I'm very 

proud now to table this petition in this legislature on their 

behalf so that the government may be aware of what their ideas 

and thoughts and concerns are. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, I move adjournment of this House.

Mr. Britton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, I too 

have a petition I would like to lay on the Table today. This 

petition, Mr. Speaker, comes from my area and it's, as you 

notice, right full of names all through that area. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I will read the prayer: 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 

Honourable Assembly may be pleased to postpone 

consideration of the Health Districts Act so that 

communities may continue their efforts to organize their 

people and have a genuine input on the process without 

intimidation or threat of arbitrary action by the government. 

 

 That the entire health care system is being reconstructed and 

the people in the communities affected have not had time or 

opportunity to properly have input into this process, 

 

 And that with the legislation involving far less dislocation 

and potential for social ill, your Assembly has seen fit to 

defer consideration of the legislation until a long process of 

consultation by the Assembly itself, 

 

 And that there is little more disruptive and threatening to a 

community than the threat of having basic health care 

services removed or placed under the control of non-local 

authorities; 

 

 As in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I now move that this House adjourn.

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your

present a petition on behalf on the people from the west side of 

the province. The prayer I will read for you. 

 

 Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 

Honourable Assembly may be pleased to postpone 

consideration of The Health Districts Act so that 

communities may continue their efforts to organize their 

people and have a genuine impact on the process without 

limitation or threat of arbitrary action by the government. 

 

 And as in duty bound, your petitioners ever pray. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — I want to inform the members that the time 

for petitions has elapsed and I will not accept the motion of 

adjournment. 

 

An Hon. Member: — Point of order. 

 

The Speaker: — What's the member's point of order? 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Mr. Speaker, I understand from our own 

regulations that a point of order . . . or a motion to adjourn is 

always in order. 

 

The Speaker: — On this particular item on petitions the 

motion of adjournment is not in order because the particular 

item has elapsed at this particular time. According to a ruling 

made by the Speaker in May 17, 1991, the total time for 

petitions shall be one hour. 

 

PRESENTING REPORTS BY STANDING, SELECT, 

AND SPECIAL COMMITTEES 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, I move the House do now 

adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — That motion is out of order because there has 

been no intervening proceeding. 

 

NOTICES OF MOTIONS AND QUESTIONS

The Speaker: — Why is the member on his feet? 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Mr. Speaker, I move the House do now 

adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — The notices of motions, oral notices, is not an 

intermediate proceeding and therefore that  



April 14, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 977 

motion is out of order. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 

 

The Speaker: — What's your point of order? 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Mr. Speaker, I believe that the regulations 

and rules of this Assembly indicate that intervening business is 

any time that Votes and Proceedings record a decision made 

by the Speaker. And I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that you 

made a ruling that the last movement for adjournment was out 

of order and therefore there is that intervening amount of 

business which makes my motion to adjourn legitimate. 

 

The Speaker: — The member does make a good point that on 

a point of order, which is recorded in the Journals, that that is 

in order and therefore his point of order is well taken, and I will 

accept his motion for adjournment of the House.

Mr. Martens: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I give notice that I 

shall on Friday next ask the government the following question 

regarding health care consultations: 

 

 Did any representative of the Minister of Health attend the 

public meeting in the community of Weyburn, Tuesday, 

April 6, 1993? If not, why not? If so, provide (a) the name 

and title of the representative; (b) a summary of the 

representations heard by the representative; (c) 

a copy of any report provided to the minister by the 

representative; and (d) the minister's response to the 

representations of the community. 

 

The Speaker: — Why is the member on his feet? 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Questions, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The Speaker: — If the member is presenting some more oral 

notices, I'm not going to accept any more. And I want to draw 

members' attention to a decision made by Speaker Swan in 

March 21, 1986, and I quote: 

 

 To go on at great length reading oral notices into the record, 

when this is not necessary to effectively give notice, 

appears to me to be an abuse of a courtesy traditionally 

extended to members. A practice that is permitted as a 

courtesy only should not be permitted to obstruct the 

regular business of the House. 

 

 I therefore direct the member for Canora to submit any 

notices . . . he wishes to give by laying them on the Table 

as provided . . . (by) rule 38. This in no way interferes with 

the member's rights to place items on the order paper. It is 

not my intention to prohibit the reading of oral notices in 

the future, but only to remind members that oral notices are 

permitted as a courtesy and will not be permitted to be used 

as a means of obstructing the House. 

 

Since every member in the opposition have had an opportunity 

to present oral notices, I will not accept any further notices — 

oral notices — from members. 

 

Why is the member on his feet? 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — I move that this House now adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — I believe that that motion is out of order. 

There has been no intermediate proceeding in the House. 

 

All right. I stand corrected. Because the Speaker has made a 

ruling and that is recorded in the Journals, I will accept the 

member's motion for adjournment.

Mr. D'Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 

 

The Speaker: — What's the member's point of order? 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, my point of order is very 

brief and I would suggest very important to the democratic 

functioning of this Assembly. The context of the Assembly 

must be taken into account in any rulings that are made. The 

context of this Assembly is that this time is that the government 

has not only invoked Draconian time allocation, but has also 

served notice that it will impose closure on closure itself. That 

is the context. 

 

Yet, Mr. Speaker, there are many completely legitimate 

questions that need to be answered before the health care Bill 

can be responsibly allowed to proceed. I submit, Mr. Speaker, 

that the questions members of the opposition . . . in the current 

context of the Assembly finds itself in due to the actions of the 

government, that those questions are not only legitimately 

appropriate but that they are essential to the proper functioning 

of this House. 

 

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, my point of order is that members 

must not be prevented from giving full notice of their 

questions. And I ask you to use the same discretion in this 

environment as you did when you ended the opposition's main 

tool of holding the government accountable — that is, sir, 

when you ended prolonging bell-ringing. 

 

The Speaker: — I have some difficulty understanding the 

member's point of order. Can the member point out to me what 

rule of the Assembly has been breached? Order. I don't need 

the member's advice. Would the member from 

Souris-Cannington tell me what rule of the Assembly has been 

breached? 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, the ruling I am referring to 

is when you disallowed the continued reading of notices of 

questions. We feel that at the appropriate time it would be . . . 

to continue doing that, sir. 

 

The Speaker: — I think the member fully understands. 

Beauchesne, I think, is very clear on it — understanding rule 

order 10: Speaker's rulings once given must be accepted 

without appeal or debate. There is no appeal on the Speaker's 

ruling, therefore your point of order is out of order. 

Why is the member on his feet? 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: — Mr. Speaker, I move the House do now 

adjourn.

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. On a 

point of order which I think will be very germane to the 

proceedings this afternoon . . . And the first point I make is in 

agreement to a previous ruling where the Speaker had clearly 

demonstrated that when the proceedings in the Assembly are 

not consistent with his view of the proper and democratic 

functioning of the Assembly, he has complete discretion to 

intervene. And we have no problem with that, Mr. Speaker. 

 

As authority to what I'm saying, I refer you to the events of last 

session when, contrary to the existing rules of this Assembly, 

the Speaker intervened in a division and ordered a vote to be 

taken. There was no provision in the rules for Mr. Speaker to 

intervene, but in his judgement the bell-ringing had gone on 

long enough. 

 

By definite logical consequence, the Speaker must have the 

discretion and authority to find that debate has not gone on 

long enough, in this case again, regardless of what the rules 

say. And I submit, Mr. Speaker, that if the Speaker has the 

right and — even as was stated by the Speaker — the duty to 

intervene when he feels that a division has gone on too long, 

then he also has a duty to intervene when it is apparent that the 

debate has not gone on long enough. 

 

It is an historical principle that the Speaker is bound not to only 

assure the rights of the majority, but clearly he has an absolute 

duty to protect the rights of the  



April 14, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 979 

minority, Mr. Speaker. There's ample precedent day in and day 

out of the Speaker exercising discretion in this Assembly, and 

sometimes, Mr. Speaker, with historic impact. 

 

Given that situation, I ask the Speaker to suspend the notice of 

motion under rule 34 at least until such a time as he has 

thoroughly reviewed his options and reported back to the 

Assembly. 

 

Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, in just a brief 

comment on the point of order by the member from Rosthern, I 

want to indicate that we have now seen the opposition 

members, the Conservative members, obstruct the House by 

moving adjournment motions after points of order a number of 

times. 

 

I would refer you, Mr. Speaker, and members, to the 

Parliamentary Rules and Forms, Beauchesne's, 6th Edition, 

page 112: 

 

 384. (2) A Member may not use a point of order to secure 

the floor in order to move the adjournment of the House. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would very much ask you to look at this, seeing 

as the members of the opposition are using points of order to 

adjourn the House in order to obstruct the working of the 

government. I think that the public watching the proceedings 

here will know full well that the members of the opposition are 

doing nothing more than obstructing the working of the 

government, and I'd ask you to rule on that as well. 

 

The Speaker: — Why is the member on his feet? 

 

Mr. Toth: — Speaking to the point of order raised by . . . 

 

The Speaker: — We have two points of order here and I don't 

know which one you want to speak to. If you let me clarify . . . 

I don't know which point of order you wish to speak to . . . 

(inaudible interjection) . . . no. Well it's very difficult to know 

whether you have two points of order until you hear the 

member speak. What I'm saying is that I think that . . . if you let 

the Speaker clarify it, I'll tell you very shortly. 

 

I want to speak first of all to the point of order raised by the 

member from Rosthern. The member from Rosthern is right 

that the Speaker has used discretion in the past where the rules 

of the Assembly simply did not apply or simply did not exist 

and the Speaker has used his discretion. In this particular 

instance the rules are very clear. Rule 34 is a closure motion. 

It's very clear on how it shall function and it has been properly 

introduced, and so the Speaker really has no authority to say no 

to rule 34. The rule is very clear. 

 

I now want to address the point of order raised by the 

Government House Leader, and that is that the member from 

Rosthern did not get on a point of order 

to move adjournment of the House. He has not moved 

adjournment of the House and therefore the point of order by 

the Government House Leader is not well taken. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 

 

The Speaker: — What's your point of order. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Mr. Speaker, my comment wasn't 

on the member from Rosthern . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. That is not a point of order. 

That is not a point of order. Order. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — Point of order. 

 

The Speaker: — If the member's on the same topic, I will not 

accept his point of order. I have made my ruling. 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 

Point of order. 

 

The Speaker: — What's the member's point of order? 

 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: — The point of order is in the 

Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules and Forms, 6th Edition, on 

page 112: The use of motions to adjourn the House . . . Pardon 

me . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order. Order, order. I have already ruled on 

that. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I would 

like to move that this House adjourn. 

 

The Speaker: — Order. Order. I want to draw the attention to 

the members on page 384, Beauchesne: 

 

 A member may not use a point of order to secure the floor in 

order to move the adjournment of the House. 

 

The member from Rosthern has just got up, asked on a point of 

order to move the adjournment of the House. And that . . . 

Order, order. 

 

I think the records will clearly indicate that when the 

Government House Leader was up on his feet, the member 

from Rosthern got up on his feet and asked on a point of order. 

I recognized the member from Rosthern on a point of order and 

he said: Mr. Speaker, I move adjournment of the House. 

 

Beauchesne is very clear on that, that the member cannot get 

up on a point of order to move adjournment of the House and 

therefore the member is out of order. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — I move this House now adjourn. 

 

The division bells rang from 4:21 p.m. until 4:31 p.m. 

 

Motion negatived on the following recorded division.

The Speaker: — What's the member's point of order? 

 

Mr. Swenson: — Mr. Speaker, my point of order . . . and I 

refer you to chapter 14 of Beauchesne's and to the practice of 

this House and to constitutional precedent in the context of the 

Canadian parliament and that point of order is, Mr. Speaker, 

that Bill 3 is irregular and must be ruled out of order. The Bill 

is irregular, Mr. Speaker, because it relies on financial revenues 

that are not votable by this Assembly and therefore are beyond 

the jurisdiction of this Assembly. 

 

Mr. Speaker, it is well-established constitutional practice that 

the Assembly may not consider measures over which it has no 

legal authority nor allocates monies which it does not have the 

power to raise. Mr. Speaker, Bill 3 purports to allocate monies 

belonging to private citizens and charitable organizations 

without any legal or constitutional basis for those allocation 

decisions, specifically monies raised, Mr. Speaker, in trust for 

such things as the construction of local nursing homes and 

hospitals. 

 

Mr. Speaker, on the basis that the Bill is irregular and cannot 

be considered by this Assembly, I ask, Mr. Speaker, that it be 

ruled out of order. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: — I want to draw members' attention to 

Beauchesne: 

 

 A point of order against procedure must be raised promptly 

and before the question has passed to a stage at which the 

objection would be out of place. 

 

And the member's right place to raise that point of order would 

have been when the Bill was introduced 

in the House — at that time and not days or weeks later. 

 

I will however, because it is a very involved point of order, 

take the member's point of order under advisement. 

 

The Speaker: — Why is the member on his feet? 

 

Mr. Toth: — I move this House adjourn. 

 

The division bells rang from 4:36 p.m. until 4:46 p.m. 

 

The Speaker: — The question before the . . . Before I put the 

question I do want to draw members' attention to rule 18: 

 

 (2) When the Speaker is putting a question, no Member shall 

enter, walk out of or across the Assembly, or make any 

noise or disturbance. 

 

I do want to draw members' attention that it is their 

responsibility to try and abide by the rules that they have set.

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It gives 

me a great deal of pleasure at this time to be able to introduce 

two people that are very near and dear to me and that is in our 

gallery opposite us, is my son Dean and his wife Brenda who 

have come down for the day and part of tomorrow, I suppose. 

He comes here every session because he likes to see what's 

going on and I think he's had a memorable afternoon. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I would ask all members to please help me 

welcome Dean and Brenda.

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

ORAL QUESTIONS 

 

Hospital Closures 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. And I 

would like to direct my question to the minister responsible for 

the closure of 52 rural hospitals in Saskatchewan, the Minister 

. . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. Order. Before the member asks 

a question, I want to make it very clear that I've noticed that 

this is becoming a habit in this House of not referring to the 

minister by the proper portfolio. And it's also very 

inflammatory to question period to preface those remarks by a 

description of the minister. And I ask all members to please 

refer to the proper portfolio of the minister and direct your 

question to that minister. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I direct 

my question to the Minister of Health. The minister is 

responsible for the closure of 52 hospitals in rural 

Saskatchewan. 

 

Madam Minister, throughout this debate you have repeatedly 

stated that these decisions about bed reductions and hospital 

closures will be up to the new district boards. But every time 

we've asked you for the list of hospitals targeted for closure, 

you said there was no such list. You said, and I quote: we will 

establish district boards and the final decision will be made by 

them. And that was only two weeks ago. 

 

Madam Minister, now it turns out you have targeted 52 rural 

hospitals for closure on October 1. Madam Minister, I ask you: 

how do you justify your actions in light of your earlier 

statements? How do you justify misleading this House and the 

people of Saskatchewan? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: — Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 

opposite knows full well that there has been no misleading of 

the House by the members on the government side. The 

afternoon's performance by the official opposition, quite 

frankly, is nothing short of a disgrace of this legislature, in a 

blatant attempt to stall the passes of passage of legislation 

which would have in fact empowered the community groups to 

organize themselves and to realize the objectives that the 

Minister of Health and the government have talked about. 

 

This shows the absolute inconsistency of their point of view — 

in the one hand refusing to allow the debate, on the other hand 

getting up and being critical of us, supposedly, in this point of 

view. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the member full well knows the question is 

misplaced and he knows that the government's intentions here 

have been always to consult and to work with the communities. 

In this context we 

continue to pursue that objective. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Mr. Speaker, I thank you. And I thank the 

Premier for having the courage to get up in this most difficult 

and trying of times. And I'm sure we appreciate that, Mr. 

Premier. 

 

I'm just aghast and amazed that you have the audacity, sir, to 

get up and accuse us of one day where we are representing the 

wishes of rural Saskatchewan to slow you folks down — you 

being the minister and the person responsible for 17-day 

closure of this House. 

 

Now your House Leader is invoking closure. He's threatening 

closure on closure on debate. And the people of Saskatchewan, 

sir, are telling us, they are telling us, slow them down. That's 

what we are being told, Mr. Premier. And what we are doing 

today, what we have done here today is . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order, order. Does the member have a 

question? I want the member to put his question. 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Is an attempt on our 

part to convey the message of rural Saskatchewan in particular 

to you as Premier. Mr. Premier, will you stand up and assure 

and reassure the people of Saskatchewan, particularly rural 

Saskatchewan, that yes you have taken note and yes you will 

slow down and yes you will come to the meetings and address 

the concerns of these people? Will you do that, Mr. Premier? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: — Mr. Speaker, the question by the hon. 

member opposite is the same old repetitive question that the 

official opposition has attempted to ask in the futile attempt — 

and I want to stress this — the futile attempt and the futile goal 

of trying to derail much-needed health care reform. 

 

When he says, slow it down, make no mistake about it, people 

of Saskatchewan, what he's really saying is, stop it dead in its 

tracks — kill. And the former premier confirms that right now 

from his seat and desk. 

 

And I want to tell you that if you don't record the health care 

system, then what'll happen is reform will take place. The only 

way that reform will take place though is the way that reform is 

taking place in Alberta where they're saying that there should 

be privatization of health care. 

 

That may be the Conservative and the Liberal approach to 

reform to health care, but it is not ours. Ours is a publicly 

funded system of support of accessibility to health care and we 

maintain to preserve it and aim to preserve it. And we're not 

going to give in to your supplications and petitions to kill 

medicare and hospitalization as you've done historically in this 

province. 



982 Saskatchewan Hansard April 14, 1993 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Mr. Premier, what are you telling the people 

of Saskatchewan? A futile attempt. Are you telling them now, 

all of those people in Saskatchewan who are writing in and 

phoning in to us, are you telling them that their efforts are 

futile? Are you telling them that their attempt to save rural 

Saskatchewan, to save their way of life, is futile? 

 

What you have just confirmed, Mr. Premier, is that you are not 

willing to listen. You are not willing to give them that choice. 

 

Your Minister of Health has gone out on repeated occasions 

and said they will be making the decision. Well, Mr. Premier, 

the axe came down today — 52 communities axed, cut. And 

you talk about preserving health care. 

 

Mr. Premier, will you do what the people of this province are 

asking — give them a true input into the decision-making 

process. That's what they are asking. They want you to be fair. 

Give them a fair hearing. Go out to Macklin; go out to all the 

. . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. Order. I think the member has 

asked his question. Let the Premier answer it. 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: — Mr. Speaker, what I've said I will say 

again. The official government's attempts to kill this Bill . . . 

the official opposition's attempts to kill this Bill, to kill this Bill 

. . . (inaudible interjection) . . . That's right. The official 

opposition's — not attempt, their stated goal, to kill this Bill, is 

futile. It's not going to succeed. You don't want to delay this 

Bill; you want to kill this Bill. 

 

You want the system to go unreformed. And when the system 

goes unreformed, what happens is what your colleagues in 

Alberta are doing, namely promoting the privatization of 

medicine, and that means the destruction of health care. 

 

And I'm telling you, that's not what the people of Saskatchewan 

want, that's not what this government wants, and the issue is 

simply this: you're either going to be onside in reforming and 

rebuilding and saving the hospital system and saving rural 

Saskatchewan or you're going to be part of that same old gang 

that you were with in 1962 when you fought medicare, the 

KOD (Keep Our Doctors committee). 

 

I'm sorry, we're not with you; we're out here to save health care 

and we're going to see this Bill passed. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, thank 

you very much. As someone much wiser than me said, is, 

methinks he protesteth too much. I really think so. He talks 

about us killing the Bill, Mr. Speaker, while the real 

executioner of rural health care is standing and sitting right in 

that chair. 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — That, Mr. Member and Mr. Premier, that is 

going to be your legacy. That's going to be the legacy that 

you're going to leave Saskatchewan. That is why they are 

calling you all over the province right now, the one-term 

Premier. You're killing the province, you're killing medicare, 

you're killing the people in rural Saskatchewan, Mr. Premier. 

 

Now I want to give you a short message. This is the message I 

want to leave with you today, Mr. Premier. Last night there 

were meetings in Frontier, there were meetings in Kindersley, 

and there were meetings in Herbert. And this is the message 

that we have received back as the official opposition.  They are 

saying they haven't received enough information. They are 

saying that the time frame is too short. They are saying that the 

bed targets are inadequate. They are saying there's no local 

control. 

 

Mr. Premier, it's not the opposition . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. Order, order. Does the member 

have a question? 

 

Mr. Neudorf: — Mr. Speaker, thank you. Mr. Premier, the 

question I have is not mine but the people of rural 

Saskatchewan in particular. They have asked me to ask you, 

considering all these items that I have brought forward, will 

you have the decency to say August 17 is no magic number; we 

will give you a sufficient time to assess what is happening to 

rural Saskatchewan, Mr. Premier. You're trying to cut him 

short because you know it's mushrooming . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Order, order. Let the Premier answer. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Romanow: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I 

think there were two aspects, or two questions, if one really 

thought and looked hard at it. One was, the question of more 

information. Note how contradictory these people are, Mr. 

Speaker. The first question was the very fact that our Health 

department people were out in rural Saskatchewan providing 

more information, which he described in these overly dramatic 

terms about execution. That he was very critical of . . . 

 

The Speaker: — Will the member please come to order. It 

now being 5 o'clock, this House stands adjourned until 

tomorrow at 2 p.m. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 5 p.m.
