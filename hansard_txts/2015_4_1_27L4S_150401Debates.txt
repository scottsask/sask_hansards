 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 6857 
 April 1, 2015 
 
[The Assembly met at 13:30.] 
 
[Prayers] 
 

ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Kelvington-Wadena. 
 
Ms. Draude: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to you 
and through you and to all members of the legislature, it’s a 
great pleasure for me today to introduce a friend to many of us. 
Don Meikle is the executive director of Egadz. He’s had a huge 
impact on children, on young moms, on babies in the city of 
Saskatoon for a number of years. 
 
He joined us in the legislature today to talk about social impact 
bonds, Sweet Dreams, that he’s been working with for over a 
year now or just about a year. We have 20 mothers and 14 
children whose lives are different because of the impact that 
Don has had. He’s making a difference in our province and 
we’re so proud to have him. So welcome to your legislature, 
Don. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I’d like to 
join the member opposite in welcoming Mr. Meikle to his 
legislature. And of course he and Egadz do phenomenal work in 
Saskatoon and go back many, many years through countless 
projects to help young people who are facing challenges on the 
street. So welcome, Don, to your legislature. I ask all members 
to join in welcoming you to your legislature. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Meewasin. 
 
Mr. Parent: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, to you 
and through you and to all members of this Assembly I would 
like to introduce my CA [constituency assistant], Matt Donlevy, 
sitting in your gallery. 
 
We never get a chance really to thank our CAs for all the work 
they do taking care of the constituents that come in and finding 
the answers through our ministries who provide them with the 
answers. But I’d like to thank Matt for all his work and taking 
care of the cat situation we ran into one time. It was a pleasure 
to work with him on that one. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Sutherland. 
 
Mr. Merriman: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 
through you, I’d like to introduce Kendra May Johnson, my 
constituency assistant. A very tough job keeping me on track 
certainly with my schedule and everything else, Mr. Speaker. It 
takes a lot of work to keep me in line, Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleagues will attest, but Kendra is very fabulous at doing it. 
And I appreciate everything that she does. Welcome to your 
Legislative Assembly. 

The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Corrections and 
Policing. 
 
Hon. Ms. Tell: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. To you and 
through you, I rise today to introduce 24 grades 4 and 5 students 
from W.S. Hawrylak, which is situated in Regina Wascana 
Plains here in Regina. Hi, guys. With them today are their 
teachers Shelly Mainprize, Kaylene Bawden, and Kelly 
Chambers, and accompanying them are the parent chaperones, 
Donica Smart and Karen Oblinski. I ask all members to join me 
in welcoming them. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Parks, Culture and 
Sport. 
 
Hon. Mr. Docherty: — Mr. Speaker, I’d also like to join the 
member from Kelvington-Wadena in welcoming Mr. Meikle to 
his legislature. Don Meikle and I had spent probably well over a 
decade working together and trying to figure out housing 
options for young people. I’d like to say that I unabashedly 
borrowed his housing model and brought it to Regina. And I’d 
like to thank him for his generosity, not only in sharing, but for 
everything he’s done in relation to young people in Saskatoon, 
Regina, and this province. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
to you and through you to all members of the Assembly, sitting 
in the west gallery is Marc Casavant who up until about a year 
ago was the director of education for the South East 
Cornerstone School Division. Mr. Speaker, I think it’s about a 
year ago he announced his resignation which then took effect at 
the end of the school year. I believe he’s now with Prairie 
Valley School Division, Mr. Speaker.  
 
I know members on this side of the House very much enjoyed, 
certainly those in the southeast part of the province, certainly 
enjoyed our working relationship with Marc, and all that he did 
in moving education forward for our students. And so I’d ask 
all members to join with me in welcoming Marc Casavant to the 
legislature. 
 
The Speaker: — I’d like to take this opportunity to introduce to 
the legislature Mark and his daughters, Eva and Zoe, from 
Brisbane, Australia. Mark is originally from Regina but has lost 
his Saskatchewan accent and picked up another. I’d ask 
members to welcome him to the Legislative Assembly. 
 

PRESENTING PETITIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to present 
a petition in support of education. And we know that education 
is one of the most vital services this government provides to its 
citizens, but yet this government has failed to deliver a 
long-term plan and vision and the necessary resources to 
prioritize the delivery of educational excellence. And we know 
that this government has failed to deliver a real plan to close the 
Aboriginal education gap, support English as an additional 
language students, and to support community schools and their 



6858 Saskatchewan Hansard April 1, 2015 

communities and students. I’d like to read the prayer. 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 
honourable Legislative Assembly call on this government 
to immediately prioritize education by laying out a 
long-term vision and plan with the necessary resources that 
provides the best quality of education for Saskatchewan, 
that reflects Saskatchewan’s demographic and population 
changes, that is based on proven educational best practices, 
that is developed through consultation with the education 
sector, and that builds strong educational infrastructure to 
serve students and communities long into the future. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
And, Mr. Speaker, the people signing this petition are from 
Esterhazy, Saskatoon, Edam, and Moose Jaw. I do so present. 
Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Mr. Wotherspoon: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise once 
again today to present petitions on behalf of concerned citizens 
as it relates to the unsafe conditions created by this government 
on Dewdney Avenue and their failure to properly and safely 
plan for heavy-haul truck traffic. And the prayer reads as 
follows: 
 

Wherefore your petitioners humbly pray that your 
honourable Legislative Assembly call on the provincial 
government to immediately take action as it relates to the 
unacceptable danger, disturbance, and infrastructure 
damage caused by the heavy-haul truck traffic on Dewdney 
Avenue west of the city centre, to ensure the safety and 
well-being of communities, families, residents, and users; 
and that those actions and plans should include rerouting 
the heavy-haul truck traffic, receive provincial funding, 
and be developed through consultation with the city of 
Regina, communities, and residents. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
These petitions are signed again by concerned residents. I so 
submit. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I’m pleased to 
present a petition again today in support of safe staffing levels 
in long-term care. The petitioners point out, Mr. Speaker, that 
many aspects of long-term care are deteriorating under this 
government; that this Government of Saskatchewan needs to 
recognize the need for safe staffing levels to provide hands-on 
care to residents; that the reality is that this government has 
removed the regulations requiring a minimum standard of care 
for seniors resulting in neglect; and that they point out that 
chronic understaffing in long-term care facilities results in 
unacceptable conditions, including unanswered calls for help, 
infrequent bathing, and a rise in physical violence amongst 
residents. I’d like to read the prayer: 
 

We, in the prayer that reads as follows, respectfully request 

that the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan take the 
following action: to cause the government to commit to the 
creation of safe staffing levels for all valued members of 
the health care team and to reintroduce actual numbers of 
staff to match the level of care needs and the number of 
residents under their care in long-term care facilities. 
 
And as in duty bound, your petitioners will ever pray. 

 
Mr. Speaker, this petition today is signed by folks in Saskatoon, 
Plenty, and Dodsland. I so submit. 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina 
Qu’Appelle Valley. 
 

Red Cross Day of Pink 
 
Ms. Ross: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to announce that April 1st has been proclaimed Red 
Cross Day of Pink. This day raises awareness around bullying 
issues and encourages everyone to speak out against bullying 
and discrimination. 
 
In 2007 a high school student in Nova Scotia was bullied 
because he wore a pink shirt. The next day two other students, 
David Shepherd and Travis Price, brought 50 pink shirts to 
school and gave them to their classmates to wear as a way to 
unite against bullying. As a result of the students’ act of 
kindness, wearing pink has become a symbol of standing up for 
victims of bullying and speaking out against bullying 
behaviour. These brave students exemplify the importance of 
standing up to bullying, and today Saskatchewan commends 
them for their brave action. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Red Cross has promoted this day for a number 
of years, and last year 135 communities and 259 schools in 
Saskatchewan participated in the Day of Pink. Today we have a 
school group in the west gallery that are wearing pink. This 
year we hope to continue that trend by encouraging everyone to 
wear pink to stand together against bullying. 
 
I would ask all members to please join me in recognizing the 
Red Cross Day of Pink. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today in the 
House as well in solidarity with all the children and youth, 
recognizing that today is Red Cross Day of Pink, the 
international day to take a stand against bullying. 
 
Day of Pink, as was said, started in 2007 in Nova Scotia after a 
student was bullied for wearing a pink T-shirt to school. Two 
others asked all students at their school to wear pink T-shirts to 
show their opposition to bullying. 
 
For many the Day of Pink is an important day to remember that 
homophobic and transphobic bullying is still a reality in our 
schools and communities, and that devastates young lives. This 
year Day of Pink coincides with Trans Awareness Week, and I 
think that’s a wonderful thing, Mr. Speaker. We know that trans 



April 1, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6859 

youth are among the most marginalized in our society and I am 
proud to have been a member of this Assembly when the gender 
identity was enshrined in Saskatchewan’s Human Rights Code. 
I hope that continued conversations about trans issues and 
bullying will help us pave a way to a future free of transphobia 
and all other forms of bullying and discrimination. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to join me in recognizing the 
importance of Red Cross Day of Pink and to show solidarity 
and to take a stand against bullying, violence, and intolerance in 
our schools and communities. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government Whip. 
 

Canadian Cancer Society Daffodil Month 
 
Mr. Cox: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Each April the Canadian 
Cancer Society’s annual daffodil campaign raises money for 
cancer prevention, research, and supports for people living with 
cancer. It is also an opportunity to raise awareness of the impact 
cancer has on the lives of Saskatchewan people. Mr. Speaker, 
we have all been affected by cancer, which is the leading cause 
of death in this country. It is a small gesture, but buying a 
bouquet or wearing a daffodil lapel pin to mark Daffodil Month 
is a good way to show support for those living with cancer in 
our communities. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the number of newly diagnosed cases of cancer 
continues to rise in Canada but fortunately so does the survival 
rate. As a government, we also continue to support 
improvements in cancer prevention, research, and treatment. 
Significant funding increases have allowed the Saskatchewan 
Cancer Agency to strengthen and broaden its prevention 
activities, early detection, and treatment for patients. This year, 
recognizing increased demand for services and rising drug 
costs, the Cancer Agency’s budget increased by $1.58 million 
to $157.3 million in total. 
 
This government believes that investing in the Cancer Agency 
is an investment in our people and our future. I ask members to 
join me in acknowledging the good work the Cancer Agency 
does, pushing for small and large changes that improve an 
individual’s chances of living to tell their survival tale. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I too rise to 
recognize Daffodil Month. Every April the Canadian Cancer 
Society holds its annual Daffodil Month fundraising and 
awareness campaign. It’s a time to remember those who have 
died from the disease and a time to show our support for those 
battling cancer, and their families. Mr. Speaker, I’m certain that 
every member of this Assembly, every person in this gallery, 
and every person watching at home on their TV or computer 
has lost someone they love to cancer. 
 
Nearly 500 Canadians are diagnosed with cancer each and 
every day, and statistics show a quarter of us will eventually die 
from cancer. Fortunately, and in part because of the fundraising 
done by the Cancer Society during Daffodil Month, researchers 
and doctors are constantly developing new treatments and 

screening techniques that have dramatically improved the 
prospects facing patients diagnosed with cancer. 
 
And so I call on all members to join me in recognizing Daffodil 
Month and in thanking all of the staff and volunteers at the 
Cancer Society for their important work making life better for 
patients and families battling cancer. Hopefully someday soon, 
as a result of all their hard work, we will be able to live in a 
world free from the pain and hardship caused by cancer. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
[13:45] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Prince Albert 
Northcote. 
 

Funding for Diefenbaker Bridge 
 
Ms. Jurgens: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. As the gateway to 
the North and a place people have gathered for centuries, Prince 
Albert is more than just a city in our province. I am proud today 
to announce that our government has contributed $1.225 million 
for significant repairs to the Diefenbaker bridge in Prince 
Albert. This includes repairs to the concrete barriers, splash 
guards, and rail guards for the northbound and southbound 
driving lanes. There will also be pedestrian walkways installed. 
 
With over $5.2 billion spent on infrastructure throughout our 
province since 2008, some $5 million of this funding has been 
dedicated to the P.A. [Prince Albert] bridge. The Diefenbaker 
bridge will be 100 per cent funded through the Ministry of 
Highways and Infrastructure. The city of Prince Albert will be 
responsible for the management of these repairs. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is just one more example of our government 
partnering with communities to make sure that their needs are 
met. As Mayor Greg Dionne notes, “The Diefenbaker bridge is 
critical to city residents, rural municipalities, First Nations, the 
natural resource sector, and tourism traffic for all of northern 
Saskatchewan.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, we couldn’t agree more. We understand this 
importance and want to make sure that this bridge is usable and 
can carry traffic safely for years to come. Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Cut 
Knife-Turtleford. 
 

More Money in the Pockets of Families 
 
Mr. Doke: — Mr. Speaker, I’m proud to say that it is a great 
time for families to be living and working in Saskatchewan. 
Compared to the rest of Canada, our province has the highest 
percentage year-over-year wage growth in January 2015. Wage 
growth is up 4.9 per cent compared to January of last year, well 
over the 3 per cent national growth. Mr. Speaker, 
Saskatchewan’s average weekly earnings were $987.51, which 
is above the national average of $947.68. The three industries 
with the highest year-over-year percentage growth in earnings 
are the arts and entertainment and recreation, information and 
cultural industries, and transportation and warehousing. 
 



6860 Saskatchewan Hansard April 1, 2015 

Mr. Speaker, not only are people in the province making more; 
they are paying less in tax. Since 2007 income tax paid for a 
family of four with a $50,000 income has gone from $2,300 to 
just $64 in 2015. And, Mr. Speaker, total provincial tax paid for 
that same family has gone from almost $6,400 in 2007 to 
$4,080 in 2015. That means by the end of 2015, that family will 
have saved $19,000 over eight years. 
 
Mr. Speaker, higher wage growth and low taxes mean more 
money in the pockets of Saskatchewan families. If the members 
opposite are finished fearmongering working families, they are 
welcome to put forward some constructive policy ideas and join 
us in the new Saskatchewan and keep Saskatchewan strong. 
Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Regina Walsh 
Acres. 
 

Investment Supported by Tax Incentive 
 
Mr. Steinley: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Evraz 
North America announced yesterday that it’s investing $200 
million in expanding its Regina steel factory. Evraz company 
president and CEO [chief executive officer], Conrad Winkler, 
stated yesterday, and I quote, “Our largest single investment in 
North America.” Furthermore, Mr. Winkler had his own 
comments about the budget and this government’s new tax 
growth incentive, and I quote, “Without those incentives, we 
would not be here today.” 
 
Mr. Speaker, the member from Regina Rosemont stood in his 
spot yesterday and commended the $200 million expansion of 
Evraz, but not even a week ago that very member voted against 
our budget that included a tax incentive that made this 
expansion possible. The member from Rosemont voted against 
expansion at Evraz and therefore voted against 1,100 new 
construction jobs and against 400 new permanent jobs. Mr. 
Speaker, actions speak louder than words, and the member from 
Rosemont sold out the hard-working people of Regina by 
voting against our budget. 
 
Our government has worked with and will continue to invite 
companies like Evraz North America to invest in this great 
province. Investments like this show the strength of our 
province’s economy. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, maybe it’s time the member from Regina 
Rosemont represents the people of his constituency instead of 
blindly following his leader in faulty Brotenomics. Thank you, 
Mr. Speaker. 
 

QUESTION PERIOD 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 

Provision of Seniors’ Care 
 
Mr. Broten: — Eunice Blanchard has been a care aid at 
Providence Place in Moose Jaw for 34 years. She’s speaking 
out today, Mr. Speaker, because she’s frustrated, frustrated at 
this Premier and this government who keep pretending that 
short-staffing is not a widespread problem in seniors’ care 
facilities in Saskatchewan. 

Eunice raises many of the same concerns that Peter Bowden 
raised when he came here from Saskatoon just on Monday. She 
talks about nurses and care aids being run off their feet, 
working double shifts, and burning out. And she talks about a 
quality of care for seniors, Mr. Speaker, that is not even close to 
adequate. 
 
My question to the Premier: is he going to argue that this is yet 
again an isolated incident, or is he ready to admit that there is a 
widespread crisis in seniors’ care in Saskatchewan? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Premier. 
 
Hon. Mr. Wall: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. I thank 
the member for his question. I know that with specific regard to 
this institution, the Minister of Health will want to comment a 
little bit later on. I can share with members of the House that 
the staffing complement at the facility that he has just 
referenced is actually up 9 per cent since the days of the New 
Democratic government in Saskatchewan. Arguably there is 
always more work to be done, but my understanding is that’s 
the case at this particular facility. 
 
And that would be consistent with what we’ve seen across the 
province where, as a result of what we’ve done in government, 
when we identified the huge deficit in health care human 
resources left behind by that hon. member’s party, we sought to 
increase it, Mr. Speaker, over the last seven years to the point 
where there are now almost 800 more care aids, front-line staff 
working in long-term care and integrated care in the province of 
Saskatchewan. There are more nurses and doctors. And we 
know that there’s more work to be done; that’s why we’ve 
engaged in continuous improvement in the system, Mr. 
Speaker, right across the system. 
 
But I hope it’s an indication that this government takes 
seriously the right complement of staffing resources in health 
care by our past actions of increasing those complements. 
Hiring more nurses. Hiring more care aids. Hiring more LPNs 
[licensed practical nurse]. Hiring more doctors and, Mr. 
Speaker, actually training more nurses in the province and 
training more doctors. And that too is a situation that was left 
behind by members opposite in government where they had 
reduced training capacity in the province. We’ve come a long 
way from those days. We know there’s more work to be done. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, this government and this Premier 
needs to start looking at the reality on the shifts, the reality on 
the front lines for those caring for patients and for residents. 
With this government it’s always a communications exercise, 
Mr. Speaker. You know, when Peter came forward on Monday 
this government said, oh well, they doubled the staff in the 
facility. Well they forgot to mention, Mr. Speaker, that they 
tripled the residents in that facility, leaving those working even 
more and more stretched thin. 
 
You know, it’s always about the communications. It’s always 
about discrediting the good, hard-working people who come 
forward with their stories, Mr. Speaker. And this government 
also left out the fact that they have a deliberate strategy of 
short-staffing by not filling the shifts, Mr. Speaker, when 



April 1, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6861 

individuals are sick. Eunice says in this facility in Moose Jaw, 
Mr. Speaker, that the number of care aids has been cut in half 
over the last two years. And like the care aid from Saskatoon, 
Eunice says, Mr. Speaker, that just one care aid is responsible 
for 32 residents with dementia at night. My question to the 
Premier: is he ready to admit that this is not acceptable and that 
it is not safe? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And there he 
goes again, Mr. Speaker. At Oliver Lodge, the number of 
residents, because of the expansion that this government 
approved and funded, the number of residents is up 53 per cent. 
That’s because of 63 additional beds that have been added, so 
53 per cent residents increased. Total staff has increased 104 
per cent during that time, Mr. Speaker. And the expenditures 
provided by the government, the revenue provided by the 
government to operate that facility is up 126 per cent, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with respect to long-term care, as I’ve said before, 
as the Premier has said, we are absolutely committed to 
working on long-term care and seniors’ care in this province. 
Mr. Speaker, at Providence Place, the staffing complement is up 
9 per cent, Mr. Speaker, while the number of residents has not 
changed in that facility. We have committed to ensuring that we 
are providing the resources to our health regions. That’s why 
our regions have over a 50 per cent increase in their budgets in 
just the last seven years, Mr. Speaker; why the increase in staff 
level, as the Premier has indicated, in full-time equivalents in 
long-term and integrated care is up nearly 800 full-time 
equivalents for roughly the same number of residents in this 
province, a far cry from what we saw from the members 
opposite. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, it’s no wonder that care aids and 
front-line workers are becoming increasingly frustrated, Mr. 
Speaker, increasingly frustrated by this government who will 
not listen and will not admit that there is a major problem and 
crisis when it comes to seniors’ care on the front lines. 
 
Mr. Speaker, Eunice talks about the horrible effects of 
short-staffing. She talks about a resident who died recently. He 
should have been in the dementia ward, but he wasn’t, and the 
facility did not have enough staff to properly monitor and care 
for him. He was wandering and he came across Tide laundry 
detergent pods. He ate some and he died. It is absolutely 
heartbreaking, and it should never, ever happen in a facility 
tasked with caring for our most vulnerable seniors. 
 
There should be an investigation into this shocking case and 
every other premature death that happens because of 
short-staffing. Does the Premier recognize that people with 
dementia require extra attention and care, and does he recognize 
that the consequences of short-staffing in care facilities can be 
deadly? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Mr. Speaker, I’m aware of the incident 

that is currently under investigation by the Five Hills Health 
Region patient safety unit. Mr. Speaker, certainly my heart goes 
out to the family of the individual in this incident. Mr. Speaker, 
our officials will be working with the health region regarding 
any recommendations that come forward. Mr. Speaker, in this 
facility it’s my understanding that there are washer-dryer units 
that are available in resident rooms, which is a bit unique 
compared to a lot of different facilities. This will be reviewed as 
a part of this process. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with respect to dementia care, absolutely this 
government takes this very seriously. That’s why this 
government increased funding for the First Link program for 
the Alzheimer’s Society to operate from $50,000 to $400,000 a 
year, Mr. Speaker, to expand that program. And that’s why this 
budget, despite having to make difficult choices, Mr. Speaker, 
that’s why this budget does include for new dementia units in 
Regina and Saskatoon to care for those individuals of the most 
complex cases, Mr. Speaker. And we look forward to making 
announcements of where exactly those facilities will be located, 
those beds will be located in these two cities. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, there should be a recognition in 
the minister’s response about the lack of staff and the lack of 
supervision of someone, Mr. Speaker, who was identified by 
staff as susceptible and vulnerable to this type of accident, this 
type of incident happening, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Now Eunice says that the residents of Providence Place and 
their families have been told by managers not to talk about 
short-staffing any more or they will lose their resident council 
meetings. So now, Mr. Speaker, we have seniors who are not 
being properly cared for because of short-staffing. We have 
vulnerable seniors dying because of short-staffing, and yet these 
residents are being threatened and told not to talk about 
short-staffing any more. 
 
Government doesn’t like this, and none of us should like this, 
Mr. Speaker, because it is absolutely unacceptable and it 
absolutely must stop. Just imagine if this was your mom, your 
dad, your grandma, or your grandpa in a vulnerable position 
watching other people die because of the lack of staffing and 
then being told not to speak up about it, Mr. Speaker. My 
question to the Premier: what is he going to do about this? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Well, Mr. Speaker, I can say with all 
assurity that nobody will be losing their resident family council 
meetings, Mr. Speaker, because it was this government that 
ensured that every single facility in this province has a resident 
family council. Because up until about a year and a half ago, 
Mr. Speaker, we had facilities that didn’t have councils, didn’t 
have council meetings, didn’t have up-to-date updates with 
families and residents. We now have that in place in every 
single facility in this province, Mr. Speaker, and those meetings 
will continue despite what the Leader of the Opposition 
suggests here today. 
 
Mr. Speaker, obviously this government has been serious about 
the issue of long-term care and seniors’ care in this province 



6862 Saskatchewan Hansard April 1, 2015 

right from the beginning. We inherited, Mr. Speaker, roughly 
the same number of beds in this province. We’ve added to the 
number of new facilities, Mr. Speaker. In Saskatoon we’ve 
added a number of beds but, relatively speaking, the number of 
beds haven’t changed since when the members opposite were 
the government. 
 
But what has changed, Mr. Speaker, is the funding provided to 
regional health authorities so that 800 additional full-time 
equivalents can be hired, could be hired in long-term care, Mr. 
Speaker, and in our integrated facilities. Mr. Speaker, obviously 
this government is committed to that, that we want to ensure 
that we have the right complement of staff. 
 
What we haven’t heard from the Leader of the Opposition is, 
what is the right number? How many people would he hire? 
What would he commit to, Mr. Speaker? I think it’s important 
that the people in this province know what the Leader of the 
Opposition has in mind. 
 
[14:00] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, this is absolutely disgusting, the 
responses that we are seeing from this minister. It is 
unbelievable. We have care aids come . . . The member from 
Estevan is heckling, Mr. Speaker. Unbelievable. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have care aids coming from Saskatoon on 
Monday. We have Eunice speaking up, Mr. Speaker, today 
from the situation in Moose Jaw. We have residents, because 
they’re not being supervised, wandering with dementia and 
Alzheimer’s, eating laundry detergent pods and dying. Now if 
the minister wants to say that the residents, the families coming 
forward are lying, he can do that. If he wants to say that the 
front-line workers, Mr. Speaker, are making up . . . 
 
The Speaker: — I would call on the Leader of the Opposition 
to stand in his place and to withdraw that remark and apologize. 
 
Mr. Broten: — I apologize and withdraw that remark, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, these care aids that are coming 
forward are coming because they see the truth. They see the 
reality on a daily basis. They can cut through the spin from that 
front bench, and they know that seniors in this province are 
suffering because of the decisions of this government to have 
short-staffing through our facilities. 
 
My question to the Premier: when will he have the courage to 
admit a mistake, admit that they have gone down the wrong 
path when it comes to seniors’ care? When will he recognize 
that seniors in this province deserve dignity, deserve respect, 
and deserve to have safe staffing levels? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Well, Mr. Speaker, what this 
government has done is taken a different approach when it 

comes to long-term care, and that’s actually ensuring that we 
are adding additional staff into long-term care, Mr. Speaker. I 
can’t, I can’t stress this enough to the Leader of the Opposition 
or the people of this province. The number of beds in this 
province in long-term care have relatively remained the same, 
despite what we’ve done on this side of the House in renewing 
old facilities, building new facilities, and adding capacity in 
some of our locations. But the number of beds have roughly not 
changed in seven years. What has changed dramatically is the 
government funding from this side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, 
when it comes to front-line staff in long-term care in our 
integrated facilities, nearly 800 full-time equivalent positions. 
 
And I can run through the list in the Leader of the Opposition’s 
hometown. In Central Haven Special Care Home, the number of 
residents is actually down 3 per cent but staff has increased 16 
per cent. In Circle Drive Special Care Home, residents are down 
13 per cent, staff is up 6.2 per cent. Mr. Speaker, I’ve talked 
about Oliver Lodge. The number of residents is up 53 per cent, 
but staff is up 104 per cent. Mr. Speaker, Parkridge Centre, 
residents are down 7 per cent, staff is up 8 per cent, Mr. 
Speaker. That’s the record on this side of the House compared 
to the members opposite. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Leader of the Opposition. 
 
Mr. Broten: — Mr. Speaker, this government, this Premier, 
this Health minister need to listen to what Eunice is saying. She 
says that the workers, Mr. Speaker, on the shifts have been cut. 
She has been working for decades, Mr. Speaker. She knows the 
reality, as do the other care aids who have come forward. 
Eunice challenges the Premier and the two other Health 
ministers to go to a facility unannounced without the aids, 
without the ministry officials, without the managers and see the 
reality that care aids face every day when it comes to being run 
off their feet, and when it comes to the type of suffering that 
many seniors experience. She challenges them to actually track 
overtime and the number of care aids, the number of times they 
are working short because the rhetoric of this government does 
not match the reality of those on the front lines.  
 
Our most vulnerable seniors are being let down. Some are dying 
needlessly and some are dying horribly, Mr. Speaker. 
Residents, Mr. Speaker, like the one with dementia who ate a 
laundry detergent pod and died because of it, Mr. Speaker, these 
residents deserve better, as do every single senior in this 
province. 
 
My question to the Premier: when will this government stop 
being so stubborn? And the member from Wood River can 
heckle if he wants, but this is no laughing matter, Mr. Speaker. 
Their approach is disgusting. When will this government stop 
being so stubborn? When will it recognize we need minimum 
regulated care standards and safe staffing levels? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Duncan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the incident at Providence Place, Mr. Speaker, 
I’m not going to do what the Leader of the Opposition has done 
and jump to conclusions in terms of what has happened because 
there’s an investigation under way, Mr. Speaker, and I think 
that that process should be allowed to play out. But what I can 



April 1, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6863 

say, Mr. Speaker, is that we’re going to take part in that as the 
Ministry of Health, working with the health region. 
 
Mr. Speaker, that particular facility, the number of residents 
have not changed. The level of funding from this government is 
up 46 per cent. Staffing levels are up 9 per cent at that facility. 
 
What we’ve said all along, Mr. Speaker, each and every year, is 
that we need to make continuous improvement when it comes 
to not just long-term care but the care that we’re providing to 
seniors, whether they live in long-term care or whether they live 
on their own and want to stay independent, Mr. Speaker. And 
that’s what this budget does. It provides funding for long-term 
care. It provides funding for purposeful rounding, Mr. Speaker, 
which I think will be an important initiative. It also speaks to 
providing care for residents that aren’t in long-term care, may 
never be in long-term care, so individualized funding. 
 
We’re going to get rid of that wait-list, Mr. Speaker, that we’ve 
had. We’re going to ensure that we have a program like 
HomeFirst/Quick Response that can be meeting the needs of the 
people that want to be in their own home, Mr. Speaker. That’s 
the balance that we’ve chosen. We don’t know yet what the 
Leader of the Opposition, what his plan is. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 

Availability of Child Care Spaces 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Tara Hobbins is a single mother of two 
five-year-old daughters. She works hard and picks up as many 
hours as she can, but the lack of child care spaces, the lack of 
full-day kindergarten, the cuts to before and afterschool 
programs, and the lack of busing make it very difficult for her 
to get by. She says this kind of system is “. . . unrealistic for a 
single mom working as much as possible, trying to keep a roof 
over our heads.” 
 
To the Education minister: what does he have to say to Tara 
today? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way 
in the area of child care. We would like to go further, but I can 
tell the members opposite what we’ve done. 
 
Since 2007 child care spaces have increased by 53 per cent or 
4,935. There are now 14,200 spaces operating in or in 
development in the province, compared to 8,850 in 2007. Of 
these spaces that are province-wide or since . . . We’ve 
allocated about 800 spaces to Saskatoon; 600 of those spaces 
are operational with the remaining coming on in various stages 
of development. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we know that we want to do more things for child 
care. We know it’s important for young families, for working 
families, and we’re going to continue to do that. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 

Ms. Chartier: — When it comes to child care, Saskatchewan is 
the worst in Canada. Less than 8 per cent of children in our 
province have a licensed child care space available to them. The 
national average is almost triple that number. 
 
Tara says she looked on Kijiji and literally drove up and down 
streets in Saskatoon looking for a sign in someone’s home 
advertising child care. This year’s budget doesn’t contain a 
single new child care spot, and this government is still refusing 
to establish an online child care registry like Manitoba and 
Prince Edward Island. Why? Because it doesn’t want to know 
the true demand for child care. It doesn’t want to know how 
many Taras are out there desperately trying to get by and 
desperately in need of proper child care. 
 
To the minister: how can he justify no new spaces and no online 
registry? 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I spent some time 
discussing this with the member opposite recently when we 
were going through budget estimates. She’s well aware that we 
have nine new joint-use schools under construction in the 
province. Each one of those, each one of those will have a 
90-space daycare which will add 810 new spaces. Construction 
is expected to begin on those later this year. So for Saskatoon, 
that means 360 new spaces, four joint-use schools in Rosewood, 
Evergreen, Hampton Village, and Stonebridge.  
 
Mr. Speaker, we have more work to do. We are going to 
continue doing that . . . 
 
[Interjections] 
 
The Speaker: — There is an opportunity still to rise if you 
want to ask questions or answer them. I recognize the Minister 
of Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, the members opposite 
have to look at the deficit that they left us in child care. Mr. 
Speaker, we are going to continue adding child care spaces. 
We’re going to continue doing it in each and every year. We’ve 
indicated that the nine joint-use schools will each have a 
daycare centre, a 90-child space in them. We opened one 
yesterday. They’re just doing the sod-turning for one adjacent 
to the University of Saskatchewan. We will look for partners, 
and we will continue to proceed in that fashion, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon 
Riversdale. 
 
Ms. Chartier: — Mr. Speaker, this minister has no idea what 
child care looks like on the ground. Parents can’t find child 
care; when they do find it, they can’t afford it. And child cares 
can’t staff these facilities. That’s what this government’s record 
is on child care, with record revenues. This government has had 
record revenues year after year. It’s blown through every penny, 
drained the rainy day fund, and has racked up billions of dollars 
in debt. It has had eight long years to get serious about child 
care, but it’s got nothing but weak excuses. 
 
Tara deserves better. Other families in our province deserve 



6864 Saskatchewan Hansard April 1, 2015 

better, and frankly our economy deserves better. Access to 
quality child care lets parents work and contribute to our 
economy. To the minister: when will this government shelve 
the pathetic excuses and get serious about child care. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Education. 
 
Hon. Mr. Morgan: — Mr. Speaker, I have a quote I’d like to 
read: 
 

Saskatchewan has the poorest record when it comes to 
child daycare. And, Mr. Speaker, I take [part in] some 
responsibility for that because I was part of a government 
that did not put a lot of new resources into child daycare. 

 
Pat Atkinson, March 29th, 2011. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to set the record straight as to what the 
numbers were. From 1992 to 2007, the overall number of 
licensed child care spaces in the province increased by only 
2,800, an average of 175 spaces per year. From 2007 to 2015, 
the overall number of licensed child care spaces in the province 
increased by almost 5,000, an average of 616 spaces per year. 
So yes, we’re going to do different things than the members 
opposite did. We’re going to continue to expand child care. 
We’re going to look after a growing economy. We’re going to 
look after families, and we’re going to look after children in this 
province. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre.  
 

Affordable Housing 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, Tara Hobbins also struggled to 
obtain affordable housing. Here’s a quote from a recent letter 
she wrote: 
 

I’m on the verge of homelessness. This upsets me due to 
the fact that I’m a hard-working, responsible employee and 
strive to maintain a good life. I don’t think that, working 
$14 an hour, I should have this problem. 

 
Tara sought help from Sask Housing, and do you know what 
they offered this single mom and two young daughters, Mr. 
Speaker? This government offered her an apartment with a 
possibility of cockroaches and bedbugs infestation. Tara says, 
and I quote, “I was revolted. I was revolted. How can a 
government property have such low standards?” 
 
I want to know what the minister says about that. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Social Services. 
 
Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, it wasn’t many years ago 
when we had vacancy rates of less than 1 per cent across our 
province in every major centre. Mr. Speaker, our government 
took immediate action to address the housing shortage, and in 
fact we’ve invested now over $581 million in housing within 
our province to develop over 8,800 units, Mr. Speaker. Our 
wait-list for social housing has gone down, Mr. Speaker. 
 
We’re going to continue to have our housing programs and to 
look at this issue. We understand that now we should look more 

closely at affordability because we have addressed the 
availability. The vacancy rates now across the province on 
average are over 4 per cent, so the programs are working, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
I’m sure with this particular mom . . . I don’t know what 
housing unit he is referencing, but we are always looking for 
better housing, and we’re renewing a lot of our housing 
portfolio. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Saskatoon Centre. 
 
Mr. Forbes: — Mr. Speaker, this is such cold comfort for Tara. 
And we know this government has cut $5.4 million from the 
Sask Housing budget this year, $5.4 million. But thankfully 
Tara ended up finding an apartment to rent, one that didn’t have 
cockroaches or bedbugs like the Sask Housing one that was 
offered to her and her young daughters. But she’s still 
struggling because the cost of rent is sky-high and she only 
makes 14 bucks an hour, picking up every shift she can. 
 
Tara is the kind of person who should be supported by Sask 
Housing. She’s the kind of person who has a real chance to get 
ahead, to give her daughters the best chance and start in life. 
But Tara was horribly let down by Sask Housing, and she says, 
I quote, “I just felt like they didn’t care or they couldn’t care 
less.” To the minister: what does she have to say about that? 
 
[14:15] 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Social Services. 
 
Hon. Ms. Harpauer: — Mr. Speaker, in my last answer I said 
how aggressively this government has been working on housing 
programs to increase the amount of housing available to those 
most vulnerable. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, I don’t think Tara wants to go back to the 
taxes that she had to pay under the NDP [New Democratic 
Party] because, quite frankly, we have given record tax cuts on 
this side. I don’t think that Tara wants to give up the children’s 
drug program that this government introduced, and I don’t think 
Tara wants to give up the active families benefit that this 
government introduced. Mr. Speaker, Tara no longer has to pay 
PST [provincial sales tax] on children’s clothing. 
 
We will always continue to work on programs and incentives 
for our families, our most vulnerable families, but we don’t 
want to go back to the taxes of the NDP because Tara would be 
struggling even worse if they were in government again. 
 
The Speaker: — Why is the Opposition House Leader on his 
feet? 
 
Mr. McCall: — Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — Please proceed with your point of order. 
 

POINT OF ORDER 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you very much. In members’ 
statements, what seems like a lifetime ago, Mr. Speaker, the 
member from Regina Walsh Acres used language that was 



April 1, 2015 Saskatchewan Hansard 6865 

clearly unparliamentary, contravening rule 51(c). He ought to 
know better, Mr. Speaker. I’d ask you to make a ruling on the 
expression that the member used. If you have to review the 
tape, fair enough. But if you could rule on that, we’d appreciate 
it very much, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. I’d like to respond to the member opposite’s point of 
order. 51(c) says “refer to another Member by name, but rather 
by title, position or constituency name.” I don’t recall hearing 
any of that, so I’d encourage the Speaker to rule that the point 
of order is not well taken. Thank you. 
 
The Speaker: — Since the Opposition House Leader has not 
indicated any terminologies that was used, I will review the tape 
to determine if there is any improper use of language in that 
statement and return to the legislature with a decision. 
 

ORDERS OF THE DAY 
 

WRITTEN QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government Whip. 
 
Mr. Cox: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I wish to order the 
answers to questions 807 to 816. 
 
The Speaker: — The Government Whip has ordered responses 
to questions 807 to 816. 
 
I recognize the Minister of Crown Investments. 
 
Hon. Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. 
Speaker, with leave I’d like to revert back to introductions and 
make an introduction if I could, please. 
 
The Speaker: — The Minister of Crown Investments has asked 
for leave to introduce guests. Is leave granted? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Minister for Crown 
Investments. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
Hon. Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. That wasn’t 
too smooth, was it? Anyway just before they leave the gallery, I 
see the member from Carrot River is up there, but I also wanted 
to join with the . . . [inaudible interjection] . . . Not introducing 
him. The member from Weyburn, who introduced Marc 
Casavant, I know Marc Casavant fairly well, not from the 
education system. But Marc Casavant was one heck of a hockey 
player, for those that don’t know. In fact he played for the 
Weyburn Red Wings when they won a Centennial Cup, one of 
the two or three that they’ve won in the history of that 
organization. And I know Marc was an instrumental player in 
that championship year. 
 
I don’t believe I ever had the chance to play with him on a 
team, but I know I certainly played a lot of senior hockey. He 

used to play up in Tisdale with the Ramblers, and I’m going to 
leave the introduction at that, Mr. Speaker. We’ll say no more 
about those days of senior hockey up in Tisdale. But I certainly 
wanted to welcome him, and I think probably his children here. 
And we won’t go any further about the Tisdale days. Thank 
you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Thank you very much, Mr. 
Speaker. To facilitate the work of committees this afternoon, I’d 
like to move that this House do now adjourn. 
 
The Speaker: — The Government House Leader has moved 
that the House do now adjourn. Is it the pleasure of the 
Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Carried. This House stands adjourned to 10 
a.m. tomorrow morning. 
 
[The Assembly adjourned at 14:20.]
