Ms. Haverstock: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I give notice that 

I shall on Monday next ask the government the following

SEDCO officials discussed offering financial support to a 

plan to produce potatoes on irrigated lands near Riverhurst;

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Mr. Van Mulligen: -- Mr. Speaker, I'm honoured to be able to 

introduce to you today, and through you to the other members 

of the Assembly, a group of 42 constituents.  They are from the 

Grace Lutheran Golden Fellowship Group from Regina 

Victoria constituency, and they've come to visit us today.  I 

hope that they enjoy the question period and they find it 

informative.  I very much look forward to meeting with them 

after the question period.  And I would ask all members to join 

with me to welcome them here today. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

ORAL QUESTIONS 

 

Future of Whitespruce Treatment Centre 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday 

the Minister of Health refused to tell this House that the 

Whitespruce Youth Treatment Centre would continue to 

operate after the upcoming provincial budget. 

 

I find this shameful disregard for the needs of our youth and 

their families.  And I'm asking today if the Premier will not 

reconsider the answer of his minister yesterday, and today give 

these youth the comfort they need in their already strained 

situation; give them some faith that they will continue to get 

the treatment they need here at home, instead of possibly 

having to leave the province.  Will you do that, Mr. Premier? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

Hon. Mr. Calvert: -- Mr. Speaker, to the member's question.  I 

want to reassure that member and all members that the 

addictions treatment for youth in this province is and remains 

and will be a high priority of this government, Mr. Speaker. 

 

In terms of decisions that may or may not be related to budget, 

of course the member will understand those decisions will be 

announced in due course. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  My question to the 

Associate Minister of Health.  Follow-up question, Mr. 

Speaker. 

 

I believe the associate minister is again hiding behind the 

deficit.  And the associate minister really hasn't cleared up the 

fact that people are concerned regarding the services that they 

would . . . that will be possibly refused to them. 

 

I ask the minister again: will you not give the youth and their 

families at this unique treatment centre -- and I'm talking about 

Whitespruce; I'm not talking about the whole program in 

general, but the Whitespruce Centre -- will you not give these 

families at this unique treatment centre some guarantee for the 

future of the centre?  And I ask you, don't hide behind the 

deficit.  Give the families and the youth of this province some 

assurances that this centre will continue to operate after the 

budget date. 

 

Hon. Mr. Calvert: -- Mr. Speaker, I would indicate to the 

member that there is no sense of hiding behind a deficit in this 

government or in this budgetary process.  In fact, we are doing 

just the opposite.  We are exposing the magnitude of this 

deficit and what it has done to our province for all of the 

province to see. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I repeat again: the department, SADAC 

(Saskatchewan Alcohol and Drug Abuse Commission), and all 

aspects of this government, we're reviewing all parts of our 

expenditures. 

 

Mr. Speaker, announcements related to the budget will be made 

in due course. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and again to the 

Associate Minister of Health.  I find it totally amazing that the 

minister doesn't seem to really care or understand how serious 

it is for people at Whitespruce.  Tax dollars will be spent by 

this government helping pay for treatment whether it is here in 

Saskatchewan or out of the province.  Will the minister not 

admit that if money is going to spent on treatment regardless, it 

should be spent here in our province instead of sending it out of 

Saskatchewan, or is the minister's real motive here to just shut 

down another good project initiated by the former government? 

 

Hon. Mr. Calvert: -- Mr. Speaker, the motives of this 



250 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

government are very clear and that is to provide for the people 

of Saskatchewan, including the young people of Saskatchewan, 

the best addictions treatment that we can provide given the 

fiscal circumstance that we're in. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Mr. Speaker, when the Associate Minister of 

Finance says that they will provide the best services available, 

does that include Whitespruce?  That's what we're asking, Mr. 

Speaker.  Does it include Whitespruce? 

 

The Minister of Health refused to tell the public what the future 

of Whitespruce Treatment Centre is.  But maybe she can tell, or 

the Associate Minister of Finance can tell us, what the future of 

funding for the treatment will be.  Will you, sir, tell the people 

of our province whether or not, if funding is eliminated for 

Whitespruce, funding will also be eliminated for people who 

then turn and are forced to go out of province for this service? 

 

Hon. Mr. Calvert: -- Mr. Speaker, I can indicate to members 

and to the House that for the past year there have been 

consultations and discussions going on with people in the 

addictions field, in the whole field of addictions treatment. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the member's question is a budgetary matter.  He 

knows that we're not going to discuss the budget at this time, 

and decisions relating to any program or any institution, Mr. 

Speaker, will be made in due course. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Prescription Drug Plan 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  My 

question would be to the Minister of Health or the Associate 

Minister of Health.  Yesterday I was at the SARM 

(Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities) 

convention, and obviously it took me a little bit longer getting 

back than it did you because I don't have the luxury of flying 

on the taxpayers' dollar. 

 

But a very important question was raised to me which was 

namely this.  A very serious question was raised by the doctors, 

and they asked this question.  They're telling me now that 

they're being told, they are being told not to advance any 

prescriptions on a repetitive basis, on a repeat performance, 

that go beyond March 20 -- no prescriptions repeated past 

March 20. 

 

I ask you, Mr. Minister: does this mean then that March 20 is 

the death-knell of the drug plan? 

 

Hon. Mr. Calvert: -- Mr. Speaker, the member brings 

information to this House that is unsubstantiated.  I am not sure 

of these kind of reports.  I can't comment on them.  If he, like 

the member before him, is attempting to discuss budgetary 

decisions today, he knows that's not going to happen.  He will 

be aware that a budget 

will be delivered in this House, if I may say, Mr. Speaker, in 

the first time in many years before the end of the fiscal year.  

That budget will be brought down in this House.  And there 

will be ample opportunity, Mr. Speaker, in that context to ask 

questions or to engage in the budget debate. 

 

Closure of Bus Routes 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, a new 

question.  This one is directed to the Minister of Highways.  

Mr. Speaker, recently communities along Highway No. 1 and 

Highway No. 48 that are serviced by Moose Mountain bus 

lines, were informed that Moose Mountain Lines intends to 

discontinue service to the area. 

 

And I have a question to the Minister of Highways regarding 

the Highway Traffic Board's review of the Moose Mountain 

bus line application to cancel routes along the No. 1 and No. 48 

Highways. 

 

The chairman of your board has said that she wants the 

provincial budget to know . . . awaits the provincial budget to 

know whether they can subsidize these routes.  My question, 

Mr. Minister: will the minister explain to the House what 

measures the board is willing to take to ensure these routes 

continue to exist for the people who desperately need the 

service? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Koskie: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  As the hon. 

member fully appreciates, that Moose Mountain bus operated 

some 30 years almost on those two lines, down the Highway 

No. 48 and down Highway No. 1.  I want to indicate to you that 

we have the interests of the people of Saskatchewan at heart.  

But I want to also indicate to you that I am the minister in 

charge of STC (Saskatchewan Transportation Company), and 

no company in the history of this province has been so 

mismanaged as that corporation, nor the finances of this 

province.  And you were a party to that, and you stand in this 

House today and ask us if we have money to fulfil the 

subsidization. 

 

I want to say to you that we're putting together a business plan 

for STC which will address the needs of the people of 

Saskatchewan within the capacity of our province to supply 

that service.  And we will be communicating with the 

respective communities in order to get their input, and I say 

we'll have STC back where it can provide from the wreckage of 

your administration. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, it's 

unfortunate that the Minister of Highways continues to hide 

behind the doom and gloom that his government portrays to the 

people of Saskatchewan.  In fact, the perception that is being 

led out there, Mr. Speaker, is the people don't really know 

whether they can believe what is being said any more by these 

ministers. 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 251 

In fact, Mr. Minister, your government has a responsibility for 

the people along this bus route.  They are telling the 

government they need the service, they need the comfort of 

being able to be mobile.  In fact there are seniors along these 

two routes, Mr. Speaker, who use that service to be transported 

from their communities to Regina for medical services.  There 

are small businesses who gain direct access to suppliers in 

order to meet the needs of their customers. 

 

Question to the minister:  is it the government's intention to 

now use the Highway Traffic Board to subsidize bus 

companies throughout the province and specifically on these 

two routes? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Koskie: -- I want to indicate to the hon. member that 

the Highway Traffic Board is presently holding or just recently 

held meetings on March 8 in Montmartre and Wawota, and on 

March 9 in Moosomin. 

 

There has been no decision, and the purpose of those meetings 

was in fact to hear the position of Moose Mountain bus line.  

And what I want to say to you is that what we are doing with 

STC -- not the Highway Traffic Board -- within the 

government itself, is looking at providing, after the wreckage 

that you left behind, a proper system of transportation through 

STC. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  And again to the 

minister.  I appreciate the fact that the Highway Traffic Board 

and certainly Moose Mountain Lines did take the time to meet 

with people along the route. 

 

But, Mr. Speaker, governments have subsidized STC ever since 

its creation so that it could service remote rural areas.  Moose 

Mountain bus lines could probably argue that they are at an 

unfair disadvantage because of the competition - 

_ STC and its subsidization. 

 

Will the minister confirm that the province will be subsidizing 

private companies as well as the public bus line?  Or, Mr. 

Minister, what other plan do you have to continue service to 

rural communities? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Mr. Koskie: -- As I have clearly indicated to the 

member, that we're looking at a complete business plan.  We 

have had coordinators go to all of the communities throughout 

Saskatchewan to communicate with the leaders in the 

communities to get their opinion, Mr. Speaker, as to what 

service is required under the restraint that we are living under. 

 

I want to indicate that we were able to provide under our days, 

adequate transportation system. But today we have an 

accumulation of over $35 million that you left with STC, plus a 

$15 billion debt in the province.  Within the framework of the 

mess that you've left 

behind, we will be addressing the transportation problem. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Mr. Speaker, a final question to the minister.  The 

minister talks about the fact of consulting with groups, bus 

services, bus companies, and people in rural Saskatchewan.  I 

want to ask the minister if the minister will take 

recommendations or suggestions that come from these groups 

seriously when you develop your policy for rural 

Saskatchewan.  Will you do that, sir? 

 

Hon. Mr. Koskie: -- All of the people of . . . Mr. Speaker, all 

of the people of Saskatchewan are important to this 

government and we intend to serve them.  Not as the other 

members opposite, the few that remain, we are not here to 

divide people but we're here to again provide the service, the 

service which they became accustomed to under the New 

Democratic government and which they lost under the last 

Tory government. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Lottery and Gaming Policy 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I have a question to 

the Minister of Finance.  Madam Minister, yesterday you 

confirmed the worst fears of thousands of volunteers 

throughout our province.  You confirmed that the government 

is going to take the money generated through the lottery system 

and put it into the Consolidated Fund. 

 

Madam Minister, do you know that this will be devastating to 

thousands of volunteers in these charities?  What will you tell 

these people when you cut off one of their main sources of 

revenue? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, I thank you very much 

for that question. In fact I did not confirm that.  What I 

confirmed was that the government would ensure that there is 

accountability for the money spent, accountability.  One way to 

ensure that accountability is to have all revenues go through the 

general revenue fund.  It doesn't mean that that is the only way 

to ensure accountability. 

 

The other thing that I said was exactly what you said, we value 

the contributions of volunteers and we will work hard to ensure 

that their contributions continue. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Quoting from the Star-Phoenix, Madam 

Minister, Mr. Speaker, you said this: 

 

 She said in addition to the lottery dollars distribution, other 

special funding avenues will be changed to conform with the 

general pool premise. 



252 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

Is that what you are going to do with these lottery funds and 

then exclude the opportunity of the charities to be able to fund 

the very essence of providing a lot of benefits to the hospitals, 

to various organizations throughout the province?  Are you 

prepared to say that? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is 

trying to put words into my mouth.  The government did two 

things.  On the recommendation of Gass we reviewed all 

special funds.  What we are concerned about is that there is 

accountability.  There are various ways to ensure 

accountability.  The other thing about this government, though, 

is that it is a very consultative government.  We are trying to 

reach a compromise whereby we can satisfy the auditor with 

respect to accountability, but we can ensure that in cases like 

the lottery issue we have the participation of volunteers.  And I 

am confident that this government will come up with that 

compromise. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, and Madam Minister, I have a 

letter here from Peter Morin to you that he's carbon copied to 

me, and it says here: 

 

 As chairman of the Regina Bingo Association I am not aware 

of the commission consulting with our association or any of 

the seven associations which make up the Regina Bingo 

Association. 

 

That, Madam Minister, is how you consult.  And I want to ask 

you this question.  You've taken . . . the minister has a 

responsibility to tell these people how those funds will be 

distributed.  If you're going to put this into a separate pool 

through the Consolidated Fund, you have a responsibility to tell 

those people how their funds are going to be generated so that 

those charities can continue.  That was your responsibility, 

Madam Minister. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, again the member 

opposite is putting words into my mouth.  He is telling me what 

I need to do if I'm going to put the revenues into the 

Consolidated Fund.  What I have said to the member opposite 

is I have made no commitment with respect to where the 

revenues are going to go -- whether they're going through the 

Consolidated Fund or not. 

 

What I have said is we have two competing propositions.  The 

auditor says he wants accountability.  We agree with that.  The 

charities and other organizations involved want to continue the 

fund in a way similar to what it is now because of the 

importance of the participation of volunteers. 

 

What I have said is that this government will consult with the 

various parties and reach an effective compromise.  And that 

compromise may not be 

putting it through the Consolidated Fund at all. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, and Madam Minister, if you're 

going to consult like the people are telling me you're 

consulting, you're not consulting at all.  You're just making 

major decisions. 

 

You said yourself in your discussion yesterday at SARM that: 

 

 . . . in addition to the lottery dollars distribution, other special 

funding avenues will change to conform with the general 

pool premise. 

 

You said that yourself.  I'm not putting those words in your 

mouth. 

 

Now you say to me, I'm supposed to . . . or you tell me what 

you're going to do in relation to these charities and the value of 

the dollars that they're going to get.  What are you going to 

provide to them?  You tell them the benefit that they're going to 

receive from all of the work that they do on a voluntary basis. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, if we could stop the 

"he said, she said, they said," what I am saying is this.  The 

Minister of Community Services, who is the minister 

responsible for lotteries, is in constant communications with 

the various groups involved.  And she understands fully the 

desire to ensure that there is accountability for the dollars 

involved in the lotteries.  And she also understands, as I do, the 

value of the contributions made by volunteers.  And what we 

are doing is working at an effective compromise.  It's just about 

that simple. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Well, Mr. Speaker, and Madam Minister, will 

the minister not admit that there are various alternatives 

available?  Will you not admit that in those alternatives, that 

you must consult with those people as to what they're going to 

do?  And I want to . . . (inaudible interjection) . . . I know I said 

that, Mr. Premier, and I will say something else that the 

associations are telling us. 

 

They're saying that over and over again to us.  And in fact the 

last time I raised this question with Madam Minister, the 

president of the associations for Regina said . . . I was surprised 

to see on STV (SaskWest Television), Madam Minister, that 

you said that you had consulted with him.  He said it never 

happened.  And that, Madam Minister, is a fact. 

 

And I want you to confirm that you're going to visit with these 

people to find out what those alternatives are so that they know 

what you're going to do. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, the member 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 253 

opposite is mixing apples and oranges.  What we're talking 

about are lotteries.  The Minister of Community Services is 

consulting about lotteries.  You're talking about bingos and the 

Gaming Commission. 

 

And what I said in this House was that I had instructed the 

chair of the Gaming Commission to do more consultations with 

the bingos and the charities involved in gaming.  That is her 

responsibility and she has made that commitment to proceed on 

that avenue. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Madam Minister, I want to point out another 

thing that I received in this letter from Mr. Moran. 

 

And it says that as you were doing your consultative work, 

which was absolutely zero, you did not ask them about the 

opportunity that would have been available to them and to you 

and to the government to allow the new bingo hall to 

re-establish itself in one of the bingo halls that was already in 

existence.  You did not allow that to happen.  And it's in the 

letter that they sent to you, Madam Minister. 

 

Would you provide us the information as to the reasons why 

you decided to put a new bingo hall in this vicinity without 

consulting those people? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, there are two 

comments here.  First of all, ironically one of the few bingo 

groups I did meet with, because I was concerned because they 

had complaints, was exactly that group -- the combined 

charities. 

 

The proposition that I had put forward in this House before is a 

simple one.  The Gaming Commission is an independent body.  

It decides who gets licences.  It decides the terms and 

conditions.  What I have requested of them is that they spend 

more time with applicants explaining the terms and conditions 

and spend more time with people who have objections to the 

decisions of the commission.  That's what I have done. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- One of the items that the president of the 

bingo halls pointed out in his letter to you, Madam Minister, 

was this: 

 

 I should point out to you that while the Gaming Commission 

was busy issuing a new licence, we were discussing how to 

close or relocate one of the existing halls.  If the decision 

were to close a hall, we were prepared to make room in the 

remaining halls for those charities displaced. 

 

Madam Minister, will you confirm that that is what they were 

prepared to do, or will you deny that they were prepared to do 

that? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, unlike the last 

government, which did interfere in the operations of the 

Gaming Commission, we allow these decisions to be made 

independently by the Gaming Commission. 

 

Let's be clear.  This is a battle among charities.  That is, there is 

one group of charities which says we do not want expansion 

because we are in the system already; there is another group of 

charities which says we need expansion because we do not 

have access to bingos.  Now the Gaming Commission has to 

make that difficult decision as to whether or not expansion is 

justified.  But it is the commission that makes that decision; not 

politicians. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Will the minister confirm that a former 

member of the legislature, Mr. Reg Gross, was involved in the 

consultation process in relation to the new bingo hall? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, I have absolutely no 

knowledge of involvement by Mr. Gross in any part of this 

process. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, and Madam Minister, would you 

be able to tell me: did you assign the responsibility of the 

Gaming Commission, in the order in council, defining that you 

were responsible for that as a minister of the Crown?  Would 

you tell us in this Assembly that you are responsible for the 

Gaming Commission? 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, if the member opposite 

would look at the legislation, what you would find is that there 

is a minister responsible to the legislature for the Gaming 

Commission.  What the legislation would also say though is the 

Gaming Commission is an independent quasi-judicial body that 

makes decisions about things like bingo licences.  And what 

this government is committed to is the integrity of the process.  

We are not going to politicize it no matter how much you seem 

to be trying to push us in that direction. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Madam Minister, the Gaming Commission is 

your responsibility.  You told us that just now.  That is your 

responsibility to this Assembly.  And I'm asking you, Madam 

Minister, was Mr. Gross involved in the dealings with the 

placement and the establishment of that bingo hall that's just 

outside of the city of Regina? 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Hon. Ms. MacKinnon: -- Mr. Speaker, what I'm saying to you 

is, from what I know, the answer to that is no.  But because the 

Gaming Commission is  



254 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

independent, I do not sit there and go through with a fine-tooth 

comb the applications and the process. Independence means 

that I don't interfere.  I know the result, same as the opposition 

knows the result. 

 

But if you are interested in independence, you don't politicize 

the process. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.

ORDERS OF THE DAY

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: -- Mr. Speaker, in regards to question 

no. 81, I would like to table the answer. 

The Speaker: -- Question no. 81, answer tabled. 

 

GOVERNMENT ORDERS 

 

SECOND READINGS 

 

Bill No. 1 -- An Act respecting the Conduct of Members of 

the Legislative Assembly and Members of the Executive 

Council, respecting Conflicts of Interest and to enact 

Consequential Amendments resulting from the enactment 

of this Act 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 

to move second reading of The Members' Conflict of Interest 

Act.  Implementation of this Act is a major step forward in 

accomplishing the democratic reforms that this government has 

undertaken to enact.  The people of Saskatchewan have a right 

to expect honesty and fairness from their political 

representatives in the discharge of their public duties.  During 

the last government's term of office, significant and sustained 

public concern arose about conflict of interest situations 

involving Saskatchewan's elected officials. 

 

Conflict of interest controversies are not just disputes between 

the government of the day and the opposition, they are 

violations of the public trust.  In order to restore public 

confidence, an attempt must be made to prevent them.  The 

current conflicts legislation governing members of the 

Legislative Assembly is vague and outdated and is based on a 

prosecutions model in which members may be charged with an 

offence for contravening the Act, but no method is set out for 

taking steps to ensure that members make every effort to 

comply with it. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the Bill before the House today takes a totally 

different approach.  It clearly sets out for members of this 

Assembly and for cabinet ministers their duties with respect to 

avoiding conflicts of interest.  A conflicts commissioner will be 

appointed as an officer of this Assembly to ensure the Act is 

complied with. 

 

The Act sets out a clear definition of conflict of interest.  A 

member will have a conflict of interest when the member 

participates in the making of a decision while knowing that in 

making that decision he or she may have an opportunity to 

further his or her own private interests or the private interests 

of the member's spouse or dependent children. 

 

Where a member has a conflict of interest in a matter that is to 

be considered by this Assembly, or by cabinet, or by a 

committee of this Assembly, or a cabinet committee, the 

member will be required to disclose the nature of that conflict 

and withdraw from the meeting without voting or participating 

in the consideration of the matter. 

 

This Bill will provide for broader disclosure of personal assets 

than presently occurs.  Members will be required to disclose to 

the commissioner all of their personal and business interests 

and the personal and 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 255 

business interests of their spouse and dependent children.  

From this statement the commissioner will prepare a public 

disclosure statement.  That statement will be filed with the 

Clerk of the Assembly and will be available for public 

inspection. 

 

Cabinet ministers will be prohibited from being involved in 

business or other activities where, in the commissioner's 

opinion, that activity would result in a conflict of interest.  All 

members, all members, will be prohibited from participating in 

government contracts without the approval of the 

commissioner. 

 

Mr. Speaker, this Bill will prohibit members from accepting a 

fee, gift, or a personal benefit connected with their performance 

of their duties of office, other than gifts received as an incident 

of protocol.  Where the value of a gift of protocol exceeds 

$200, or where the total value of gifts received from one source 

in any year exceeds $200, the member must immediately file a 

disclosure statement with the commissioner. 

 

This new Act will also prohibit members from using insider 

information or improper influence to further their private 

interests or the private interests of their spouse, children, or 

business associates. 

 

The commissioner's job will be to ensure that the Act is 

complied with and to determine whether or not particular 

matters are a conflict of interest.  There are two aspects to this 

duty.  Firstly, members will be able to ask the commissioner 

for advice when they are unclear as to their responsibilities in 

specific situations.  That's important, Mr. Speaker, because 

under the present legislation there is simply no place where a 

member can go to determine whether or not they are in 

compliance with the Act or in violation of the Act. 

 

Secondly, a member, or indeed this Assembly, may ask the 

commissioner to prepare an opinion respecting the compliance 

of any member with the provisions of this Act.  Where the 

commissioner receives a request for an opinion or forms his or 

her own opinion that an inquiry is advisable, the commissioner 

will be authorized to conduct an inquiry to determine whether a 

member is complying with the Act.  The commissioner will 

provide a report on the inquiry to the Assembly, and where the 

commissioner finds that a member is in violation of the Act, 

the commissioner may recommend an appropriate penalty. 

 

This Assembly will have broad powers to impose a range of 

penalties in those circumstances, including ordering the 

member to comply with the Act, reprimanding the member, 

imposing a fine on the member, suspending the member, or 

declaring the member's seat to be vacant. 

 

The government will be prohibited from awarding a contract 

other than an employment contract, or granting a benefit to a 

former member for a period of one year after the member 

ceases to hold office. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I believe all members of this Assembly 

will join with me in welcoming this new Act which clearly sets 

out the standard of behaviour expected in the performance of 

our duties, and provides for meaningful and effective 

enforcement of these standards. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of An Act respecting the 

Conduct of Members of the Legislative Assembly and 

Members of the Executive Council, respecting Conflicts of 

Interest and to enact Consequential Amendments resulting 

from the enactment of this Act. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Mr. Speaker, may I have leave to introduce 

guests? 

 

Leave granted. 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Ms. Haverstock: -- Thank you very much.  Mr. Speaker, I'd 

like to introduce to you and through you, two individuals in the 

east gallery from the south-west part of our province, Mr. Jerry 

Ruehs and Neil Dunham.  They're good friends of mine and 

have done a great deal of work in the south-west in agriculture. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

SECOND READINGS 

 

Bill No. 1 (continued) 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, we are 

generally in agreement with this Bill. 

 

We have some concerns.  We would have liked to have had a 

little more input into the Bill ourselves, which would've 

probably helped us . . . probably would have helped us move 

this Bill along a little quicker.  We would like to have some 

input as to who the commissioner will be. 

 

We would also like to have some input, Mr. Speaker, into 

several other parts of the Bill.  We certainly agree with the 

minister that this Bill is a Bill that's been needed, and I think 

it's something the public has been asking for.  And we on this 

side of the House, Mr. Speaker, are certainly not in 

disagreement with this Bill.  But because it's a far-reaching 

Bill, we would like to have a little more time to look at it. 

 

For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I move to adjourn debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 14 -- An Act to amend the Statue Law 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 

to move second reading of The Statute Law Amendment Act, 

1993.  This Act makes several minor amendments to a number 

of existing statutes.  It corrects inaccurate references, 

typographical errors, 



256 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

and other minor mistakes in the statutes. 

 

It also corrects errors made in previous consequential 

amendments or makes consequential amendments that were 

previously missed.  These amendments ensure that minor 

technical errors in the legislation of this Assembly are 

removed. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of An Act to amend the 

Statute Law. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The opposition 

would like a little bit more time in going through all of the 

details because it deals with many different laws, and so on that 

point is going to adjourn debate for now, Mr. Speaker, and then 

move to the next Bill. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 15 -- An Act to amend The Limitation of Actions 

Act 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today to 

move second reading of The Limitation of Actions Amendment 

Act, 1993. 

 

These amendments will eliminate limitation periods for 

commencing civil law suits in two kinds of cases.  There will 

be no limitation period for claims for damages arising from 

sexual misconduct including incest. 

 

There will be no limitation period for claims for damages 

arising from non-sexual assaults occurring within an intimate 

relationship or a relationship of dependency.  This will be 

particularly relevant to cases of child abuse, spousal abuse, 

elder abuse, and abuse by someone in a position of authority 

like a teacher, doctor, or even a member of the clergy. 

 

In a well-publicized decision in October of 1992, the Supreme 

Court of Canada dealt with the application of the general 

two-year limitation period to a case of incest.  It held that in 

cases of incest the limitation period would not start to run until 

the victim was reasonably capable of discovering both the 

wrongful nature of the assailant's acts and the connection 

between those acts and the victim's injuries or problems. 

 

They stated, that is the Supreme Court stated, that there would 

be a presumption that this would happen some time during the 

therapy.  The court however urged legislators to reform this 

area of the law and commented favourably on proposals in 

Ontario and in British Columbia to abolish limitation periods in 

certain cases of sexual assault.  That led to our consideration of 

the matter and to the introduction of this Bill before this 

Assembly. 

 

(1445) 

 

Mr. Speaker, I'm confident that the amendments proposed 

today will empower many victims of sexual assault and spousal 

abuse in particular to take action 

to hold their assailants responsible for the damage inflicted on 

them.  The reality in so many cases, Mr. Speaker, is that the 

victims of a sexual assault in particular, that happens at an 

early age, will block that memory out as children, and not have 

it in their conscious memory as they grow older.  And only 

when they're in their adulthood, when they're undergoing 

therapy in respect of all the problems that they're having with 

life, do they discover that the real source of their problem is 

something that occurred while they were children. 

 

Under the present law, they have to commence these actions 

within a period of two years from the date on which they 

become adult -- 2 years from their 18th birthday.  Which means 

they've got to start the action by the time they're 20. 

 

Well if they haven't taken therapy by that time, Mr. Speaker, 

they don't even know they have an action.  And so they may be 

late in their 20's or even in their 30's or 40's before therapy 

brings to their mind the real problem; the real cause for all the 

problems that they're having.  And this Bill will enable them to 

take a civil action against the perpetrators of the assault after it 

has come to their attention. 

 

So saying, Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of An Act to 

amend The Limitation of Actions Act. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I just want to say 

that in the general context of the statements that you have 

made, Mr. Minister, this side of the Assembly will not be 

standing in the way.  However, we will just take some time to 

look at it and see whether it has some implications that are 

more far reaching than as you have indicated. 

 

And we will take a look at that and therefore, Mr. Speaker, I 

move the adjournment of debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 18 -- An Act to amend The Victims of Crime Act 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Speaker, I rise on second reading of 

this Bill.  This is a companion piece to the Bill that we have 

just debated. 

 

It has to do with the way in which the victims of crime and the 

funding arrangements that are available are administered in 

similar cases to the ones that we have dealt with in the previous 

Act.  Under the present law, those claims have to be made 

within a period of one year of the date on which the offence 

takes place.  And for the reasons that I mentioned in my 

previous second-reading speech, that is not appropriate in the 

cases of some crime. 

 

The purpose of this Bill is to remedy that situation, to open up 

the situation, and to allow those claims to be made at a later 

time. 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 257 

So saying, Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of this Bill. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I just . . . I guess in 

preamble to the remarks that will be made later, it would be a 

good idea for us, Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Minister, if we would 

have available to us all of the laws in relation to this Bill that 

would be implicated or involved in where a one-year time 

period was expanded or narrowed. 

 

And we'd like to have all of the laws that apply . . . that this 

applies to, or whether the one that we were talking about, The 

Limitation of Actions Amendment Act, is the only one that it 

applies to.  That's a question that we will be raising in 

committee.  And if I can give you an advance warning of that, 

you can have some of that information available. 

 

And with that, and among other things, Mr. Speaker, I move to 

adjourn debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 16 -- An Act respecting the Interpretation of 

Enactments and prescribing Rules Governing Acts 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 

to move second reading of The Interpretation Act, 1993.  This 

Act sets out essential rules for the interpretation of statutes.  

The main purpose of passing a new interpretation Act now is to 

update and clarify its provisions.  The existing interpretation 

Act was passed in 1943 and has not changed significantly since 

then. 

 

This new Act also encompasses the provisions of The Statutes 

Act.  That Act sets out rules respecting such things as the form 

of Acts, citation of Acts, and the duties of the Clerk of the 

Assembly with respect to the keeping of Acts, and the 

authentication of copies of Acts.  Those provisions have not 

changed significantly since they were first enacted in 1898. 

 

The new Act also eliminates the complicated procedures 

established by the demise of The Crown Act when it was 

passed in 1912. 

 

A major new initiative undertaken in this Act is to establish in 

legislation rules for persons serving as directors and officers of 

public corporations with respect to conflict of interest, duty of 

care, and a right of indemnity, where they comply with that 

duty of care. 

 

The rules enacted are much the same as those that apply to 

persons serving as officers and directors of business 

corporations and non-profit corporations. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of An Act respecting the 

Interpretation of Enactments prescribing Rules Governing 

Acts. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, as this is a fairly complex Bill, 

we will be taking some serious look at it.  And with that, I 

move adjournment of debate. 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 17 -- An Act to amend The Fatal Accidents Act 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today to 

move second reading of The Fatal Accidents Amendment Act, 

1993. 

 

The Fatal Accidents Act allows survivors of a person who is 

killed to sue the person who caused the death.  There are three 

components to the Bill before us today. 

 

Firstly, common law spouses are given the ability to make an 

application under the Act.  This is consistent with amendments 

to other provincial legislation in the last couple of years, which 

gave rights to claim maintenance to dependent common law 

spouses. 

 

Secondly, as part of ongoing work in recent years to 

standardize limitation periods, the time limit for making an 

application under the Act is extended from 12 months to two 

years after the death of the deceased. 

 

And lastly, the types of monetary loss for which damages may 

be awarded are expanded to include grief counselling, loss of 

income, and other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred 

as a result of the deaths.  The purpose of this amendment is to 

try to ensure that particularly in cases of children's deaths, the 

survivors are not financially impaired by the death of a family 

member. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of An Act to amend The 

Fatal Accidents Act. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I want to say that 

this is of some interest to me and it has been since my father 

died in an accident.  And I was an older person, although my 

sisters were not; they were minors.  And I want to just say that 

it is of some interest and we will be taking a look at what the 

implications are for deaths of children within that framework, 

as you've outlined. 

 

And we will take a look at it to see whether it is extensive 

enough.  For even as we go into some of the kinds of things in 

litigation that occur today which were different 20 years ago, at 

the implication that it has on insurance companies. And I think 

we need to take a serious look at those items as well.  And 

therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask for leave to adjourn debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 19 -- An Act respecting Survivorship 

 

Hon. Mr. Mitchell: -- Mr. Speaker, I'm pleased to rise today to 

move second reading of The Survivorship Act, 1993.  This new 

legislation reflects a growing consensus that the existing 

principle on which The Survivorship Act is based is not 

appropriate. 



258 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

The existing rule is that where two people die at the same time, 

the older is deemed to have died first.  This arbitrary rule was 

established to deal with the problem of how to determine who 

is entitled to property in situations where it is impossible to 

know which of the two people died first.  It was intended to 

avoid confusion; however it can and does create unjust and 

inequitable results and operates contrary to the probable 

intentions of the deceased people if they had thought about the 

situation where they had died in a common disaster. 

 

This new Act adopts as its basic principle respecting the 

division of property, the idea that where two people die in a 

common disaster situation, then each is in law deemed to have 

survived the other; thus, the property of each will be identified 

separately from the property of the other and will pass to 

whoever would receive it under the terms of the will, or the 

intestacy if there is no will, as if the other co-deceased had died 

first.  So the property simply goes to the people who would 

ordinarily have received it from the deceased person. 

 

A provision is included in this Bill, Mr. Speaker, to deal with 

the situation where the persons who die at the same time are 

joint tenants.  In such circumstances the estate of each joint 

tenant shares equally in the property and avoids the difficulties 

that the law encounters now. 

 

Another feature of the new legislation is a provision which 

treats people as having died together if they die within five 

days of each other.  The purpose of this provision is to 

acknowledge that in some cases, although it is clear that one 

person died before the other, their deaths come so close 

together, perhaps separated only by a few minutes, that it 

doesn't make sense to have the property of the person who died 

first pass to the person who died second, and then to the 

successors of the person who died second. 

 

It is a common practice to insert a similar provision in wills.  In 

wills the usual survivorship period is 30 days, so that if spouses 

die within 30 days of each other they are in effect deemed to 

have died at the same time.  The first beneficiary is bypassed. 

 

This five-day period, which has no particular logic to push it 

other than you've got to pick some period, is one that has been 

recommended by the law reform commissions in Alberta and 

British Columbia, and we believe that it would be appropriate 

in the circumstances covered by this Act. 

 

Some provisions of the existing Act are maintained.  The 

provision, for example, which states that The Saskatchewan 

Insurance Act governs with respect to insurance proceeds, is 

not changed.  That Act presumes that the beneficiary 

predeceased the person whose life was insured in the event that 

they die in a common disaster situation.  This is consistent with 

the new principle in this Bill respecting other property of the 

testator. 

We are also maintaining the provision in the existing Act that 

states that the terms of a will govern where the will gives 

direction for the disposition of property in the circumstances 

dealt with in this legislation, so that people can by their wills 

bypass the provisions of this Act.  And therefore if a will 

provides for what will happen to the property if both the 

testator and beneficiary die in a common disaster or within a 

certain period, then the provisions of the will will apply. 

 

The Act does not interfere in any way with the provisions of 

wills; rather it provides a new, more equitable approach for 

determining how property will be divided where two persons 

die at the same time. 

 

Law reform commissions in Manitoba, British Columbia, and 

Alberta have recommended that the oldest-died-first 

presumption in the common disaster situation be replaced with 

the approach proposed in our new legislation.  The provinces of 

Ontario, Manitoba, and New Brunswick have already made 

changes to their legislation to incorporate this new approach. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I move second reading of an Act respecting 

Survivorship. 

 

(1500) 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I found it very 

interesting listening to the Minister of Justice, the Attorney 

General, speaking about these relationships that exist in some 

of the accidents that occur.  Many times those are things that he 

suggested, that people die within a short period of time of each 

other and the subsequent relationships that they have in relation 

to the wills and the other things that are implicated by the very 

fact that this happens.  The estates and those kinds of things. 

 

And I think that some consideration I think needs to be made 

on whether five days is the right period, and you mentioned 

something about that being a kind of a number you picked 

because of other places doing that . . . or using that number. 

 

I think that one of the things that may be of some concern is, as 

we have talked about spouses in the discussion earlier, would 

those spouses who have lived in a common law relationship 

and being still married to another person . . . or divorced from 

another person and have implication in relation to that.  Are 

those some of the things that maybe need to be dealt with in 

this Bill? 

 

And therefore, Mr. Speaker, because of all of these things, we 

are going to take a good look at it.  We look at it as a possible . 

. . well a distinct benefit, Mr. Speaker. And therefore because 

we're going to take a look at it, I move adjournment of debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 6 -- An Act to amend The Prairie and Forest Fires 

Act, 1982 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 259 

Hon. Mr. Lingenfelter: -- Mr. Speaker, it's my honour to rise 

in the Assembly today to move second reading of an 

amendment to The Prairie and Forest Fires Act, 1982. 

 

The purpose of this amendment, Mr. Speaker, is to reflect the 

government's ongoing practice of recruiting emergency 

fire-fighters on a volunteer basis, provide clear authority to pay 

emergency fire-fighters, and enhance the government's capacity 

to deal with the extreme fire hazards. 

 

Mr. Speaker, effective forest fire suppression is vital to 

sustainable forests in Saskatchewan -- protecting lives, 

property, and community from the ravages of wild fire and 

maintaining a forest industry which employs almost 6,000 

Saskatchewan residents with an annual payroll of $70 million. 

 

The sustainable forest concept also includes a wide variety of 

other forest users and environmental and ecological concerns 

that defy a dollar value.  Each year the Department of Natural 

Resources expends a great deal of energy preventing, detecting, 

and suppressing prairie and forest fires.  The vast majority of 

this activity is in or near the northern provincial forest.  

However, The Prairie and Forest Fires Act also provides 

authority for rural municipalities to initiate fire protection and 

suppression activities. 

 

Several sections of this Act are deficient and need to be 

changed.  The amendment which is being brought forward will 

deal with these deficiencies and changes to the following areas:  

clarify the definition of fire fighting; reflect the government's 

use of voluntary as opposed to compulsory conscription in 

hiring emergency fire-fighters; provide clear authority to pay 

volunteer fire-fighters; and enhance government's capacity to 

deal with extreme fire hazards by broadening the authority to 

institute an open-fire ban when conditions warrant. 

 

Implementing these changes will improve the administration of 

the statute and provide an increased level of protection for fire 

fighting, the public, and the valuable forest resources. 

 

Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge all members of the Assembly to 

support this Bill, and I now move second reading of an 

amendment to The Prairie and Forest Fires Act. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I don't have a lot of 

forests in my constituency, but I know that it is of interest to a 

number of other people.  And I now move, Mr. Speaker: 

 

 That this Assembly now proceed to consideration of the 

second reading of Bill No. 10, An Act to Protect Municipal 

Property Taxpayers in the Province of Saskatchewan through 

the repeal of The Hospital Revenue Act. 

Seconded by the member from Rosthern.

ADJOURNED DEBATES 

 

SECOND READINGS 

 

Bill No. 3 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 

motion by the Hon. Ms. Simard that Bill No. 3 -- An Act 

respecting Health Districts be now read a second time. 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, it's again 

a pleasure for me to stand in this Assembly and to direct a few 

remarks toward Bill No. 8. 
 

Mr. Speaker, in my remarks today I will and intend to focus 

narrowly on one aspect of this Bill.  In particular, I will focus 

on the principle of this Bill, the principle this Bill embodies, 

which through its marriage with The Hospital Revenue Act, 

provides the provincial government the power to impose 

property taxes on municipalities without the consent of 

property owners.  Mr. Speaker, that used to be referred to as 

taxation without representation. 
 

Now, Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health and the Premier of 

Saskatchewan have been spreading 



260 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

 a great deal of confusion around the province about this issue.  

Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I suggest to you that this Bill cannot be 

discussed without reference to the existing legislation which 

directly impacts the principles of the Bill. 

 

Specifically, we have the minister and the Premier trying to 

make out that The Hospital Revenue Act is somehow The 

Union Hospital Act.  Because if they fail to do that, then the 

principles on which this present Bill are based becomes 

obvious.  It becomes obvious that The Hospital Revenue Act is 

intimately tied to the principle of this Bill and the Premier 

wants this fact to be hushed up. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, members of this Assembly should be aware, 

as every municipal councillor in this province is aware, that 

there are two pieces of existing legislation at play here.  One is 

The Union Hospital Act, which no one, and I repeat no one, has 

demanded be repealed immediately or prior to the passage of 

Bill No. 3.  The other is The Hospital Revenue Act, which must 

be repealed before this Bill 3 can be passed or the basic 

principles of the Bill itself will have to be fundamentally 

changed. 

 

What is the difference, Mr. Speaker, between The Union 

Hospital Act and The Hospital Revenue Act?  Well, Mr. 

Speaker, the government should understand that union hospital 

boards include representation from the municipalities which 

contribute funding.  Union hospitals do in fact have 

representation, and therefore, at least to some extent, the 

principle of no taxation without representation is upheld, even 

in the face of the new, centralized health boards. 

 

The Hospital Revenue Act on the other hand simply vests 

power in the hands of the minister to raise property taxes.  Mr. 

Speaker, the municipalities have no legal representation at all.  

They are dictated to once more, only this time within the new 

structures proposed by this Bill -- dictated to once more by an 

all-powerful, big-brother New Democratic government. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the fact is that The Hospital Revenue Act, if it 

exists at the same time as the new health structure that the 

government is here proposing, provides a dangerous back-door 

method for offloading of health care funding onto property 

taxes.  That is the message your loyal opposition must raise in 

this Assembly, at the same time as it is being raised by both 

SARM and SUMA (Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities 

Association) representatives across this province.  And, Mr. 

Speaker, that is the bottom line. 

 

Now we have heard the Premier say he is engaged in 

consultations with municipalities to come up with alternatives.  

But, Mr. Speaker, if that is the case, then it is an admission by 

the Premier that his government is not yet ready to proceed 

with any dramatic changes to the health structure of the 

province.  If he is not in a position to repeal The Hospital 

Revenue Act, then he is not in a position to impose health care 

districts. 

The point is that The Hospital Revenue Act and the new, 

centralized health boards contemplated in this proposed 

legislation cannot be allowed to coexist.  Indeed, Mr. Speaker, 

in a very real way it can be said that Bill No. 10 on the order 

paper is consequential to this Bill No. 3.  Withdraw Bill No. 3 

and Bill No. 10 can be set to the side. 

 

Because, Mr. Speaker, what we are talking about is a 

fundamental principle in our society.  It is a principle that 

property taxes should be levied only in respect of services to 

property.  Water and sewer, streets and sidewalks, protection of 

property through police and fire, and like kinds of property 

services -- these are the things that property taxes are intended 

to support.  They not only should not, but, Mr. Speaker, 

property taxes simply cannot support human services such as is 

contemplated by this proposed legislation.  The financial and 

economic capacity just is not there. 

 

Municipalities are finding it increasingly difficult to keep the 

streets safe or even repaired.  We just have to look around 

Regina to see how badly in need of repair some of the streets 

are, let alone taking on the province's job of providing health 

care. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, social services in their various forms are 

indeed the responsibility of the provincial government in any 

event.  This legislation must recognize that fact. 

 

Mr. Speaker, it is not simply a matter of protecting those who 

actually own their own home or operate a small business.  

Unlike the NDP (New Democratic Party) government would 

have you believe, Mr. Speaker, renters pay property taxes as 

well. 

 

It is a strange notion that members of the NDP have that 

property taxes are taken out of the pockets of the landlord.  

Those taxes, Mr. Speaker, are directly passed through to the 

renter. 

 

So those who rent their homes should not be fooled by the 

government opposite.  Renters can take no comfort in higher 

property taxes to take over provincial funding of health care.  

The rent goes up, and the cost of moving from being a renter to 

owning your own home goes up as well.  So in a very real way, 

leaving the social service burden, property taxes, in a double 

whammy for those who rent. 

 

Moreover, Mr. Speaker, higher property taxes for any reason, 

but in particular for reasons of funding provincial 

responsibilities such as health care, seriously impair job 

creation.  When property taxes are properly used to service 

property, the economic base of the province can actually be 

enhanced and the potential for job creation is improved.  The 

appropriate principles of taxation of property can actually 

contribute to economic development, Mr. Speaker.  The 

economic production for homes and businesses, of the roads 

and sewers, can support the basic infrastructure and therefore 

provide more room for growth. 

 

However, Mr. Speaker, inappropriate property 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 261 

taxation undermines economic activity, depresses job creation, 

and discourages people from living in the province or investing 

in the province. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the government has cried over the past few days 

about $23 million in revenue being lost if the property taxpayer 

is protected, if that principle is embodied in this Bill.  But, Mr. 

Speaker, the Minister of Health said that the 23 million was 

raised by union hospital districts and not under The Hospital 

Revenue Act. 

 

Let me quote the minister, Mr. Speaker.  I quote Hansard of 

March 4 on page 114, Hon. Ms. Simard: $23 million that is 

presently raised through taxation by union hospital districts. 

 

So the minister in this Assembly acknowledged that the money 

comes from union hospital districts, and there was no 

conditions or caution to her statement. 

 

I now quote section 4 of The Hospital Revenue Act, which I 

say must be repealed before the current Bill can be proceeded 

with.  Section 4 of The Hospital Revenue Act states, and quote: 

 

 4  The hospital revenue tax shall not be levied in any year in 

respect of . . . property: 

 

  (a) in a municipality or in a portion of a municipality that 

is included within a union hospital district . . . 

 

I am sure you see the problem, Mr. Speaker.  The minister says 

the 23 million is raised by union hospitals, not The Hospital 

Revenue Act.  I say it's a problem, Mr. Speaker, because if the 

minister was truthful in this Assembly -- which of course we 

must accept that she was -- then the repeal of The Hospital 

Revenue Act will have no impact on the $23 million raised 

pursuant to The Union Hospital Act. 

 

Mr. Speaker, The Union Hospital Act provides the authority for 

raising revenue to support union hospitals.  And I repeat, it is 

The Union Hospital Act, not The Hospital Revenue Act.  The 

Hospital Revenue Act which offends the proper principles of 

the proposed legislation is an authoritarian and undemocratic 

instrument. 

 

It concentrates taxation power in the hands of the minister and 

does not provide representation for those being taxed.  It does 

not direct the revenues to union hospitals and it is an exposed 

threat if left in place with the establishment of centralized 

health boards that this Bill would see. 

 

Mr. Speaker, these are not complicated subjects if they are 

looked at honestly, and that is all SUMA, SARM, and the 

official opposition ask -- an honest assessment.  I say again 

therefore, Mr. Speaker, that this Bill just in principle alone is 

repugnant to this Assembly.  It attacks one of the most basic 

elements of our parliamentary system, the element of 

representation before taxation. 

But there are many other problems with this Bill which I know 

the opposition member responsible for Health will want to 

explore.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I will take my place and 

allow my colleagues into the debate, and any other member of 

this Assembly who would like to enter the debate to speak to 

this Bill as well.  Thank you. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

(1530) 

 

Mr. Trew: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  This Bill, to me 

embodies what this government is all about.  It embodies 

empowerment of people, the people of this province, to make 

decisions that affect themselves in their local communities 

where they live, where they work, where they retire, where we 

raise our children. 

 

This Bill says it is no longer acceptable for people in the 

Legislative Assembly to make decisions that affect how health 

is going to be delivered, how health services are going to be 

delivered.  This Bill empowers people at a local level to set up 

district health boards that will look at health in a wide-ranging 

area -- not only the delivery of hospital and emergency 

services, Mr. Speaker, but the whole wellness that can include 

Meals on Wheels; it can include home care delivery services; it 

can include a wide range of things. 

 

And we're saying that the local health boards will know what is 

needed locally far more than . . . Even if those of us in the 

Legislative Assembly could agree that we're going to do the 

best we can for a specific district, even if we agreed to that, I 

may not know, I may not be familiar with, let's say, Norquay, 

Saskatchewan.  I may not know what's needed in Norquay and 

district.  One of my colleagues, I think, would have a much 

better idea; perhaps several would.  But it matters not what the 

community we pick. The people that reside in that area can 

decide much better than we can. 

 

It's kind of like . . . In a former life I used to work for 

Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.  I was in the farm service division.  

And I remember vividly receiving a news release from the head 

office of Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the head office being right 

here in Regina, and they were proudly announcing that the new 

look farm service division was going to include Quonsets.  And 

that was all they were going to build was Quonsets for farm 

service warehouses. 

 

I was a warehouseman at the time, and I and my colleagues 

laughed because we knew that a curved Quonset simply did not 

provide adequate storage needs for what we needed. 

 

It was done with the best of intentions, and unfortunately I 

came . . . or I should say fortunately I came to know firsthand 

how that decision that had been made in Regina affected 

people in Outlook.  You see, Mr. Speaker, I was transferred to 

Outlook shortly thereafter and I wound up working in that very 

Quonset that was inadequate. 



262 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

Point being: ask people who are going to be responsible for 

delivering services or who are recipients of services or who are 

otherwise involved in a community what it is that they need, 

and they can tell you. 

 

So I'm very proud, Mr. Speaker, of this particular Bill because, 

as I've been trying to point out, it does empower Saskatchewan 

people.  And that, I believe, epitomizes what this government is 

all about. 

 

Starting in August there was "A Saskatchewan Vision for 

Health" document that was released.  And stemming from that 

was an attempt to have all residents and stakeholders involved 

in the health reform process.  The Health Districts Act results 

from that and from extensive consultation. 

 

There was one overwhelming message that came through, and 

that was people were saying they wanted more direction, they 

wanted more specifics about how they form health districts.  

How to do it, is what people were asking.  They were not 

saying should we or could we or can we.  It's how can we?  We 

want to be part of the solution in the greatest Saskatchewan 

tradition.  But people were saying, but we need our roles and 

our responsibilities more clearly defined. 

 

The Health Districts Act provides some of that direction, Mr. 

Speaker.  This legislation in fact ensures that boards will be 

accountable to the communities that they serve, as well as 

being accountable to the provincial government.  It deals with 

how boards will ultimately come to be elected, the numbers of 

people involved in the health district boards, who they are 

responsible to. 

 

I notice in this legislation it sets up that wards will be created 

through consultation with the districts and may be based on 

geography and/or population.  This will ensure that smaller 

portions of a district are not left out, and so that the larger 

centre in a health district board couldn't monopolize all of the 

positions on the board, but rather you would have 

representation from throughout the health district. 

 

I note also, Mr. Speaker, that there is a booklet put together, 

Working Together Toward Wellness. It's a "Planning Guide 

For Saskatchewan Health Districts," and Part I is entitled, 

"Strategic Planning." 

 

I was reading through it as I was preparing to make my address 

today and I must compliment the Minister of Health, the 

Associate Minister of Health, and indeed the people in the 

Department of Health that put this booklet together.  It is a very 

helpful booklet, well designed, well thought out, trying to 

address as many of the concerns as people have. 

 

And I think the reason that this booklet is so well designed, in 

addition to having a very good writer, is that the Department of 

Health and the minister and the associate minister have, I 

know, been holding extensive meetings throughout this 

province talking with people about 

wellness, talking with people about health care districts.  And 

the very people that they're meeting with on a regular ongoing 

basis are saying, we've got some concerns and here they are.  

Well once you recognize what those concerns are you can 

address them as the department has done through the minister 

and the release of this booklet. 

 

I noted on page 6 that with the permission of the Saskatoon 

Health Board they did a sample statement of the Saskatoon 

Health Board mission statement.  It lists six points that the 

health board believes.  And then it lists the goals of the health 

board.  And, Mr. Speaker, I made a note by it, very good, 

because the goals of the health board I think are what this Bill 

is all about.  It's going to be enabling us to deliver more 

effective health care, more effective health prevention right 

across the whole piece. 

 

One of the goals was: 

 

 To bring an effective integration and co-ordination in the 

delivery of hospital, long-term care and community-based 

health care services. 

 

Second is: 

 

 To ensure easier access by individuals and families to the 

most appropriate level and form of health care in relation to 

their needs. 

 

I think it is very laudable that for the first time certainly in 

many, many years in Saskatoon they have a health board that 

says, here is the health care needs of our community. How do 

we best put our efforts towards delivering and meeting those 

needs?  Is it through home care?  Is it through building six 

more hospitals?  Is it through hiring more doctors or more 

nurses?  How can we best deliver wellness and enhance the 

general health of the population? 

 

That's what they're addressing in Saskatoon.  That's what 

they're addressing in Regina.  I'm picking on Saskatoon 

because that happens to be what they used in this planning 

guide, Mr. Speaker, and it's not because I'm trying to slight the 

Regina Health Board.  I think they're doing very good work 

here as well. 

 

I note also in this planning guide for Saskatchewan health 

districts, on the back page there are no fewer than 20 practical 

tips for obtaining community input.  And again I come back to 

the theme of what I'm talking about -- community input; people 

making decisions for themselves; people being empowered to 

say this is what we need, and then empowered to go about and 

see that that happens. 

 

These tips include things like: 

 

 7. Develop ways to involve persons with varying points of 

view, which could include opposing points of view.  Learn to 

value constructive dissension (it says). 

 

Well this is hardly a document that's being put together so that 

anything can be rammed down 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 263 

somebody's throat.  This a document that says, value people 

when they don't agree with you; hear what they're saying; try 

and address their concern; and try and be solution oriented; try 

and work together in a Saskatchewan way -- neighbours 

helping neighbours, friends helping friends.  Let us do that, Mr. 

Speaker, let us do that as we go about passing this Bill which 

takes some very good steps towards us enhancing the health 

care system in Saskatchewan. 

 

I believe the leadership provided in this Bill is just second to 

none -- the very fact that the minister and the associate minister 

and others in the Department of Health have been out and 

about consulting with the people of Saskatchewan.  Actually it 

makes me very pleased, Mr. Speaker, because I know that this 

is in response to what the minister and others have been 

hearing as they're conducting this consultation process 

throughout our great province. 

 

I also know that increasingly -- not just in Health but in all 

fields particularly as they are funded by the provincial 

government -- we are being asked to do more with less.  I met a 

member of the Regina Health Board not so long ago.  We got 

involved in a discussion about health and a discussion about 

government finances.  That health board member said, you 

know you're the first government that has, in the history of 

Saskatchewan -- first government in the history of 

Saskatchewan that has to provide services with less.  We have 

to make do with less.  First government. 

 

I then turned it around and said, yes but we've set up the 

Regina Health Board, and you people are being the first group 

that we're saying, not only will you do with less money in total 

in Regina in terms of health care expenditures, but you must 

provide more services for less money.  It's a pretty difficult 

challenge, one that I'm confident the Regina Health Board is 

diligently working towards, Mr. Speaker, and they've made 

some significant strides -- strides that not everyone will agree 

with, but such is life. 

 

The very fact that we've set up a health board and said, now 

deliver as rational a system as you possibly can; provide the 

greatest level of health care to people in the Regina district and 

to people across the province as they come to the core 

hospitals, the three core hospitals for surgery or in emergencies 

stemming from perhaps major accidents. 

 

It's heartening, Mr. Speaker, to see what's happening.  It's 

heartening to see the health board in Regina grappling with the 

issue.  I think that that should be not just restricted to Regina 

and Saskatoon, but that health boards should be set up and will 

be set up right across the province. 

 

This particular Bill that we're dealing with today is one that 

will allow that to happen.  It will further the empowerment of 

the people of Saskatchewan.  It will further empower them to 

make decisions in their local communities where those 

decisions can be best made. 

Does this mean that in the local communities suddenly they're 

going to have all the money they need?  Of course not.  With or 

without the regional health boards, money is going to be an 

ongoing problem for quite some time, thanks to the former 

administration, thanks to the $740 million in interest that we're 

paying every year. 

 

(1545) 

 

But I'm not trying to discuss about the fiscal situation.  I'm 

trying to point out that The Health Districts Act is a good piece 

of legislation that empowers the people of Saskatchewan right 

from corner to corner to corner to corner of this province.  

Everyone will be included in the health districts. 

 

Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I announce I 

will be supporting this particular Bill.  And I want to again 

congratulate the Minister of Health, Associate Minister of 

Health, and all who have been involved in bringing this Bill to 

where it is today and in preparing the planning guide for 

Saskatchewan health districts and the users' guide to Health 

Districts Act. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Ms. Hamilton: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I rise 

to support the health districts legislation that's before us, but 

also to congratulate the minister and the members in the 

department and also the many thousands of people across this 

province who have come together in consultation and have had 

a chance and an opportunity to speak with us on what they 

would like to see as health districts legislation. 

 

This has not come up, Mr. Speaker, out of the blue.  It has had 

a long history in its coming and it has the support of many 

people.  It's also a time when I've had a long association with 

the issue of health reform and the issue of health districts in 

that I was a former member of Regina City Council and 

chairperson of the board of health.  Its main mandate was to 

provide preventative health care services and wellness for the 

Regina community. 

 

And I also sat as the vice-chair of Regina Pioneer Village, 

which is a seniors housing complex with anything from 

innovative housing units to provide some independent living 

for seniors, with a support system behind them, to level 4 care 

for our seniors in Regina. 

 

And it was at that time that the Murray report was 

commissioned by the members opposite.  It was at that time 

that our medical health officer, Dr. Hutchison, and her 

department prepared a very thoughtful, well-researched brief to 

the Murray Commission that I was pleased to be a part of 

presenting to the Murray Commission, and had many helpful 

suggestions. 

 

And it was the kind of thing that our member from Regina 

Albert North talks about -- a community drawing together to 

give their ideas and their ways to provide effective and 

efficient health care to their community, but also to look to the 

wellness approach 



264 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

to health care. 

 

And an approach that speaks about housing has an important 

role to play in the health of people, that the way we provide for 

our people who are greatest in need has a role to play.  The 

economy and the employment that we provide for people has a 

strong role to play in the wellness and the health of individuals.  

And that it also provides a framework for people to come 

together and take control of their health care and be part of a 

health care system and health care reform. 

 

With that in mind, many people came to city hall forum to 

present to the Murray report and the Murray Commission.  

When all was said and done, the commission cost the taxpayers 

of Saskatchewan about $1.8 million.  And what did the 

members opposite do with that report?  Well it was like many 

reports before it; they went out and asked people to be 

contributing, and then they shelved it. 

 

Why did they shelve it?  Well they shelved it; they shelved 

other reports.  I remember a report prepared by Ms. Schneider 

on reproductive health and women's health in the community.  

It was shelved too.  There were many, many other health 

reports that were important to people in Saskatchewan, 

important to women and children in their communities and 

their health -- all shelved. 

 

At that time our Minister of Health did speak to the Murray 

report.  And there were many areas where, as members of 

opposition, we commended the Murray Commission and the 

recommendations in the report.  However, there was one thing 

that we could not agree on, which was a very important 

principle. 

 

We felt, gone are the days of the big-bang theory where big 

government comes in, a heavy-handed approach, and tells you 

what they're going to provide for you and what is good for the 

community and the health of the community that they've made 

arbitrary decisions upon and foisted upon the community. 

 

This doesn't speak to the style of government that we want to 

see.  It's the same thing we talked about when we were saying 

economic development . . . and the economic development 

authorities were saying consultation with communities and 

empowering communities to be in control of their health care 

needs is the way of the future and the way the people are 

asking us to be involved in a democratic process. 

 

Therefore this legislation is called enabling legislation, and that 

about says it all.  It enables people to be involved.  It allows for 

the integration of health services and increased community 

involvement, and allows for people to determine for themselves 

what's the most effective way to deliver services; what is the 

most effective and efficient way to meet the needs of their 

communities, and allows them to look at a broad scope of 

community need that will be immediately involved in the 

health of the individuals they serve. 

 

So health boards can now under this legislation plan, 

coordinate, and provide health care services.  They can 

promote and encourage health and wellness.  They can become 

involved with many providers in their communities and draw 

them together to assist them in the provision of many services 

that meet the needs of their community, and employ people.  

Because indeed provision of health care services for a 

community is a model of community-based economic 

development. 

 

It also allows them to appoint advisory committees.  And we 

found that's very important when we look at the working of the 

Regina Health Board and the advisory committees they have, 

where they can draw in people with expertise in areas where 

decisions have to be made.  We can allow for a representative 

from the unions, from labour, and SUN (Saskatchewan Union 

of Nurses), and so on, to come together with the managers in 

the system and the health care professionals and providers of 

health care, and have a broad scope and perspective on the 

issues that come before the board and allow them to have input 

to the board decision making. 

 

So indeed, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is legislation that 

enables people to be a part of reform and to be part of 

revitalizing the health care system in this province. 

 

This Act empowers people in Saskatchewan in communities 

across the province and health professionals to take an active 

role in planning, delivering, and governing as we all move 

together to build a more efficient and effective health care 

system. 

 

Now that was the work that was left undone by the people who 

were the strong leaders in health care, not only for 

Saskatchewan, but across the country.  It was the big-ticket 

item, and it was the job that was left undone.  And we all know 

it's a difficult task. 

 

We all know that it involved a challenge for all of us.  We 

knew it would be tough, and that's where the members opposite 

lacked intestinal fortitude, the courage, and more seriously, the 

vision that's required to carry forward with health reform. 

 

Because we know what their vision entailed.  It entailed Fair 

Share Saskatchewan.  It entailed setting up bricks-and-mortar 

structures across the province so that they could go their 

random ribbon-cutting ceremonies.  And what's that all about?  

It's easy to see the motivation there is short-term political 

pork-barrelling.  Straight and to the point. 

 

It's not a long-term view.  It's not taking a shred of decency so 

that people could take an impact in their own lives without 

political interference and without the heavy hand coming down 

and saying: this is good for you because it's good for me; I can 

stand in front of a building and cut a ribbon. 

 

It's the reason why they expect that our minister's going to go 

out and become politically interfering and politically involved 

in the management of the health 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 265 

care system, that somehow our government's going to be a 

duplicate of their model and go out and become politically 

interfering in every day-to-day decision that happens out there 

without letting people take power in their own community and 

manage their own community's needs. 

 

That's not our way.  It's not up to us to short-circuit the 

long-term good of all people in Saskatchewan for short-term 

political gain.  Well they say: we have to do this, we must get 

involved in the day-to-day management because then there's no 

accountability.  And that's totally incorrect when you look at 

the legislation that's before us.  The legislation states clearly 

that health boards will be accountable. 

 

They're going to be accountable in many ways.  They must 

provide annual financial statements and estimates to the 

minister before each fiscal year.  Those estimates cannot 

forecast budget deficits without prior approval of the minister.  

The boards will provide reports upon the minister's request 

which supply annual financial statements and which have been 

independently audited.  And therein lies financial 

accountability. 

 

In terms of health service provision, the Department of Health 

will be defining a range of core services and boards will be 

required to either provide those services directly or ensure 

they're available to residents through the contracting out to 

other groups in the community.  But they must ensure a high 

standard of service that the department outlines is going to be 

the core of services provided.  And therein lies accountability. 

 

Well another mechanism -- accountability -- is the outlining of 

how the boards will be appointed and elected members.  They'll 

be elected by the residents of the health district, which 

represents the ultimate form of accountability in a democratic 

system. 

 

The boards will also be required to make their by-laws open to 

the public and the boards will hold at least two public meetings 

each year and can hold more open meetings if they require.  At 

the public meeting the boards must present their operation and 

expenditure plans for the coming year and report on the 

effectiveness of the programs that they deliver to their 

community, and therein be accountable to the people that elect 

them. 

 

Now why the appointed members?  Appointed members allow 

us to look at that and see if there are any aspects of a 

community that need to be represented and will allow 

nomination by the districts themselves to say, we need to add 

representation and provide a broader scope to these boards and 

we therefore ask you to nominate and will put forward names 

in nomination for the minister to appoint. 

 

It also helps when you're able to appoint someone from a 

neighbouring district and then therefore adds to that 

community spirit, the cooperation and the sharing of ideas, and 

will allow for districts to cooperate and share with each other in 

a spirit of 

togetherness, and not the politics of division of the past 10 

years in this province. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, The Health Districts Act is very important to 

the province of Saskatchewan.  But we all recognize, because 

in our own idea change is always very difficult, it's difficult for 

individuals to grasp and to adapt.  But, Mr. Speaker, the people 

in Saskatchewan told us that they are ready; they're ready for 

this change; they're excited and enthusiastic; and they're 

coming together to work on the changes that are needed for 

health reform in this province. 

 

We can provide the facilitators from the department.  We can 

provide, as has been pointed out to you before, planning 

guides, and say what works or isn't working in other areas.  We 

can put forward the legislation that helps to bring people 

together and have a framework to operate in. 

 

But, Mr. Speaker, the real strength of this Act is the people 

across Saskatchewan who are the leaders, who are the strong 

problem solvers and the contributors to something that they 

believe is long overdue.  And they feel that the reform that's 

under way is necessary to the health and well-being of 

everyone in their community. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we all join in wishing them well in the formation 

of their new health districts under The Health Districts Act, and 

we wish them well in the election and the appointment of their 

board members who will serve them and serve them well, and 

address the needs of the individual communities in this fair 

province. 

 

And with that, Mr. Speaker, I support the health districts 

legislation that's before us and ask all members to join together 

in this important milestone in health reform and health care that 

once again will provide leadership to this province, and not 

only to this province but to the nation. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

(1600) 

 

Ms. Stanger: -- Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.  I'm proud to 

stand in favour of this Bill, The Health Districts Act.  I want to 

congratulate the minister for her courage, her wisdom, her 

determination to carry this Act through. 

 

Watching the Minister of Health reminds me of as a child 

watching people like Tommy Douglas, like Woodrow Lloyd, 

like Allan Blakeney doing the things that we knew we had to 

do to be progressive in this province. 

 

As the minister has said, this is a Bill that is a framework for 

the health care system that is more broad, more comprehensive, 

and that provides a more well-rounded health care and system 

for all the people of Saskatchewan. 



266 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

Mr. Deputy Speaker, I want to congratulate, with the minister, 

all the stakeholders that have taken part in the process.  I want 

to congratulate the health care workers, the Saskatchewan 

doctors, the nurses, the CNAs (certified nursing assistant), the 

home care workers, the community leaders who have met and 

consulted with the minister, have argued, gone over their plans, 

and have finally arrived at a consensus for this breathtaking 

new program. 

 

I want to congratulate the people of the Cut 

Knife-Lloydminster constituency because these folks work 

long and hard to try and come together in a new health district, 

and I think we'll be hearing from them soon.  I also want to 

thank the folks because I think -- including the doctors in my 

area -- every level of health care worker recognized that health 

reform had to take place. 

 

One thing that I know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is that we can't be 

afraid of change.  It may feel comfortable to stay in the old 

system but it has become ineffective, it has become expensive, 

and it isn't providing the care that we know it could provide. 

 

I spoke to a health care worker today.  She's a dear friend of 

mine and she said, we can provide better care, Violet; I am 

convinced of that because . . . I apologize, Mr. Deputy Speaker, 

I said my name.  The health care worker I was speaking to said 

to me, I know we can provide a better system because working 

together in larger areas we can provide care that we can't in 

small little groupings now. 

 

We were leaders in health before because we had to be.  Before 

medicare people were held economically hostage by their 

health.  One accident, one prolonged illness, and a family could 

be ruined. 

 

I remember a story of a colleague, 25 years ago, that moved to 

California.  She was covered by the health system with the 

district board that she was teaching with.  She contracted 

cancer and thought that she was covered.  She was covered for 

the first year and a half, after that no more coverage.  This 

whole family was destitute by the time the lady passed away.  

These are the kind of horror stories that people in our 

movement have tried to prevent.  A complete family could be 

ruined. 

 

So we came together under Tommy Douglas and Woodrow and 

countless other brave pioneers to bring in medicare, and 

provided collectively what could not be done individually.  

And I think that's the essence of the things that many of us on 

the government side of the House believe in -- doing things 

collectively that we cannot do individually. 

 

Now medicare is accepted across Canada, and that system 

which Saskatchewan fought so heroically to put in place is in 

danger again.  The concept, Mr. Speaker, is still important.  But 

over the years the delivery system has become creaky, 

inefficient, repetitive, unwieldly, and unresponsive -- hence the 

wellness model. 

Folks today want to become involved in their own health.  It 

was evident at a recent meeting in Neilburg with about 150 

health care workers and people that were involved in the health 

system, that they were very enthusiastic.  The same applies to 

government.  People want to become more involved, and so 

they should.  People in every system should be more 

accountable. 

 

Instead of people going to a doctor and having him prescribe 

what their health should be, I think doctors today, when I speak 

to them, they want people to become involved in their own 

health care.  So consulting with a doctor, with a person, with 

the health care workers in your area, we all can become more 

accountable for our own health. 

 

And I think this is what the wellness model does: a system that 

will provide integrated services, rationalize them, coordinate 

them so that a few precious dollars we have -- thanks to the 

giga-Tories -- go where they need to go, to the preservation of 

the system, not the continuation of something unworkable. 

 

Many things to praise in this Act, many sound points, as the 

minister said yesterday.  One of the most important is that it's 

community based.  The throne speech talked a great deal about 

partnerships.  Here is a perfect example.  Reform this radical, 

this important, could not take place unless there were 

community consent and community cooperation.  And, Mr. 

Speaker, we've got it. 

 

I remember 1962 very clearly, and remember how the people in 

our government at that time had to fight to bring medicare in.  

This time it's not that much of a fight because people have 

come together and realized that there has to be health reform.  

We are only getting opposition from a few people and I think I 

don't need to name who they are.  I know that stakeholders in 

my constituency are excited by the challenge given them in the 

wellness program.  They are ready for reform and will make it 

work. 

 

Cooperation is not just a buzz-word, but necessary, for the 

simple reason that health is everybody's business; just as 

government is everybody's business.  I think I could make a 

parallel here on democratic reform and health reform.  I think 

that people in our society today want to be more involved in 

government and it'll be better if they do become more involved.  

They want to be more involved in the health system and it will 

be better because they are involved.  If people give up their 

rights and their democratic rights to a few people, they can 

expect the system to evolve to the opinion of those few people. 

 

It may be more difficult for us as individuals and as leaders to 

work in a system where we all have to give our opinion and 

where we have to fight for what we believe in.  But those are 

the kind of systems that are going to last.  And I can tell you 

when we look globally at the structural changes that are taking 

place in the world today, we have to be leaders.  Whether we 

are working in a hospital in Maidstone, whether we are an 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 267 

MLA sitting in this House, whether we are a cabinet minister, 

we all have to work together if we're going to have the kind of 

economy, the kind of society, that we believe in. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Ms. Stanger: -- Now I can tell you that taking responsibility 

for your own health means more than just going to a doctor 

once a year and popping a few pills now and then.  Often we 

hear great criticisms against doctors and the system.  I can tell 

you that many doctors that I know personally want health 

reform to happen.  Many times people have pressured them to 

act in the way that they did.  Now working together, all of us 

can come up with a better system. 

 

As has been said many times before, wellness extends far 

beyond check-ups and hospitals and a spoonful of sugar to 

make the medicine go down.  Wellness cuts across every aspect 

of our lives, from occupational health to school lunch programs 

for undernourished kids.  As a former teacher, I can tell you it's 

very difficult to teach a hungry child.  In fact, it's almost 

impossible. 

 

Who better to decide what is needed in a particular region than 

the people of that area?  And who better to elect members of 

district boards than citizens of that district?  This program is 

exciting because it puts responsibility where it should -- right 

in the hands of the people. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, reform is necessary because frankly the 

present system is pricing itself out of existence, not being very 

effective at the same time.  But more importantly, reform is 

necessary because it returns power to people. 

 

Of course there would be problems to iron out.  Mr. Speaker, I 

can't think of a single program or a single project that a 

government takes on that runs perfectly from day one.  What 

you need is total commitment and cooperation from the people 

that are initiating the program and that are involved in the 

program.  And I have enough confidence in Saskatchewan 

people that this health reform is going to work. 

 

In fact 10 or 15 years from now people are going to be 

discussing the Minister of Health and lauding her for the 

courage that she has had to put this program into place.  I don't 

think anybody understands the personal costs when people 

become committed to something that they believe in.  But 

people are willing to do that because they are doing it for the 

greater good, not for themselves personally. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, reform is necessary because frankly the 

present system, as I said before, is pricing itself out of 

existence.  And remember, as I was saying -- I got kind of 

carried away here, but that's all right too -- remember we are 

going to have some problems in health reform.  But we can 

iron these out.  I mean you can never put in a system that 

answers all the questions initially. 

Meeting with some of my health workers, some of the RMs 

(rural municipality), some of the town councils, there were 

questions that they were concerned about.  Some of them, you 

can answer.  But some of them you can't answer until you're 

half-way through the system.  A lot of these will have to be 

worked at, and people are going to have to cooperate.  But if 

they're determined to the philosophical framework, it's going to 

work. 

 

Members on our two sides of the Assembly never tire about 

talking about cooperation.  It's all you hear from our side of the 

House and the opposition side of the House. 

 

Well okay.  If we're all talking about cooperation, how about 

having some cooperation from members opposite?  I mean, 

they didn't have the courage to start this health reform.  It isn't 

easy for us.  Now that we're biting the bullet, let's all do it 

together. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

Ms. Stanger: -- I have faith in Saskatchewan people.  I have 

faith in their vision and their ability to work together for the 

common good.  And I have faith in their determination to make 

this program work, because it is a good program and because it 

is their program. 

 

I feel sorry for the members of the opposition who can only 

say, at least we brought in the health card.  Wow.  I feel even 

more sorry that all they can say about this program is only 

designed to pit urban people against rural people -- their old 

plan.  That bothers me more than anything.  Because for the 

restructuring that is going to have to take place in the '90s we 

are going to have to have urban and rural people working 

together, not pitted against each other. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I am excited about the wellness model and this 

first necessary step.  I support it.  My constituents support it.  

My health care workers support it.  We all are confident we 

have picked the right path to take us into the health care of the 

next century. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to read something from a man that 

would have been a constituent of mine if he was still alive.  He 

lived from 1842 to 1886 -- Chief Poundmaker.  And I think that 

in these words he sums up what we must do as leaders and 

what we must do as people of Saskatchewan: 

 

 "It would be so much easier just to fold our hands and not 

make this fight . . . to say (we) can do nothing. 

 

 I grow afraid only when I see people thinking and acting like 

this. 

 

 We all know the story about the man who sat beside the trail 

too long, and then it grew over and he could never find his 

way again. 

 

 We can never forget what has happened, but we cannot go 

back nor can we just sit beside 



268 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

the trail." 

 

And those were words spoken by Poundmaker many years ago.  

But they apply to the spirit and the essence of what we are 

trying to do.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

(1615) 

 

Mr. Neudorf: -- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker.  I've been 

listening with a great deal of attention and interest to the 

members that have been speaking over the last hour or so. 

 

With one opinion that has been stated I would certainly concur, 

and that is that the piece of legislation before us is an extremely 

important piece of legislation.  There's no doubt about it 

because of the monstrous potential impact that it is going to 

have on the people of Saskatchewan. 

 

We hear a great deal of talk, Mr. Speaker, about the 

consultative process.  And I would just like to remind members 

opposite that if they are so involved in the consultative process, 

then I would just assume that after having consulted with 

SUMA, after having consulted with SARM, that they would 

see fit that indeed they will abide by the requests of these 

organizations and others for some dramatic amendments to the 

Bill as it is before us now. 

 

I trust also that they will listen to the front-line troops out there 

delivering the health care services and the concerns that they 

have, and that the government members will see fit to agree to 

amendments that they are recommending. 

 

Mr. Speaker, we just heard a request by a member opposite that 

all people of Saskatchewan should join together and bite the 

bullet in this particular problem.  And I would suggest to you, 

Mr. Speaker, that if you bite a bullet too hard it explodes, and I 

caution members opposite on that particular aspect. 

 

Now having listened carefully, Mr. Speaker, to sundry 

back-benchers strutting forth on the stage here for a brief 

moment of glory as they recite the lines written by the Minister 

of Health, that indeed I would urge them to give some serious 

thoughts to the implications of this Bill.  And as we go through 

it, Mr. Speaker, in further speeches in second reading, that they 

listen carefully, that they do give it careful thought, and that 

they are going to be open-minded to the point that they would 

recognize that not just that we as the opposition members but 

the people who we represent, and the views of the people in the 

province that we are representing, that indeed they do have 

some good ideas and that they will be prepared to accept some 

amendments that we will be bringing forth as we progress in 

this debate. 

 

But with those few remarks at this time, Mr. Speaker, I beg 

leave to adjourn debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

Bill No. 11 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 

motion by the Hon. Mr. Calvert that Bill No. 11 -- An Act to 

amend The Wakamow Valley Authority Act be now read a 

second time. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  We have some 

concerns about the intent of this legislation but we feel that at 

this time that concern can be dealt with in committee and we're 

prepared to let it move to committee. 

 

Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and referred to a 

Committee of the Whole at the next sitting. 

 

Bill No. 12 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 

motion by the Hon. Mr. Tchorzewski that Bill No. 12 -- An 

Act to amend The Wascana Centre Act be now read a 

second time. 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  As my colleague just a 

moment ago indicated, we really do not have any fundamental 

problems with the present Bill.  And the concerns and 

questions we will be raising, we're more than prepared to raise 

in committee, and we're willing to allow this Bill to go to 

committee. 

 

Motion agreed to, the Bill read a second time and, by leave of 

the Assembly, referred to a Committee of the Whole later this 

day. 

 

Bill No. 7 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 

motion by the Hon. Ms. Atkinson that Bill No. 7 -- An Act 

respecting Social Workers be now read a second time. 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I would 

like to spend a moment on Bill No. 7, a Bill that's An Act 

respecting Social Workers.  Mr. Speaker, there are many 

elements contained within this Bill that the official opposition 

will endorse and that we look forward to endorsing. 

 

Social workers provide very important services to many, many 

people in Saskatchewan.  Most social workers are overworked 

and strive each and every day to get through the many cases 

that they have on their desks.  Recently, Mr. Speaker, I had the 

pleasure of talking with a few social workers who find that the 

case load that they are facing is certainly increasing, especially 

in the area of abuse, child and parental abuse, and they find that 

it's not within their ability to leave the office at 5 o'clock and 

go home and be able to sit down and enjoy their families 

without having the phone ring maybe at 7 o'clock or maybe at 9 

or even 11 o'clock being called out to address a situation. 

 

So we here on this side of the House certainly  



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 269 

recognize the problems that many social workers face and we 

want to compliment them for their endeavours and hard work.  

Each and every file folder on a social worker's desk is 

important -- important because every file folder represents an 

individual, an individual with very serious problems, problems 

that social workers across this province are asked to and must 

work to resolve. 

 

I admire the dedication and untiring efforts of people in this 

field.  The work that they perform is quite often overlooked 

and unrewarded.  Society relies on social workers, like Mr. 

Pekrul who was recently recognized as outstanding in his field 

by the Canadian Association of Social Workers. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this Bill will enable the 

Saskatchewan Association of Social Workers to establish 

standards of practice.  I have had an opportunity to consult with 

some of the members of this association on this Bill and we 

intend to keep in touch with members of the association 

regarding this Bill's passage. 

 

I understand, Mr. Speaker, from news articles and the 

minister's remarks, that the association endorses this legislation 

and had a part in developing it.  Although the opposition at this 

point does not plan on holding this legislation up, I do have 

some concerns and questions on this Bill that I plan on 

addressing when the Bill is in committee. 

 

For example, yesterday the minister said that this Bill was 

necessary in order to prevent individuals who call themselves 

social workers from using the title to attract clients.  This is 

understandable, Mr. Speaker, yet exceptions will be made for 

anyone with five years of experience as a social worker.  

Exceptions will be made for those with five years employed in 

the practice of social work.  I am interested in what the 

definition of this area of work will be. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I know a number of people currently employed as 

youth workers and corrections officers who may consider 

themselves to be employed in the practice of social work.  Will 

the association also consider this social work? 

 

I know that some individuals who work with the handicapped 

and other special children and adults consider themselves 

social workers.  These people may have some schooling, 

whether it be a university or SIAST (Saskatchewan Institute of 

Applied Arts and Technology) training, but ultimately they 

consider their profession to be that of a social worker.  Will the 

association share this view? 

 

Who is going to designate who will be allowed into the 

association?  Will those who work in shelters for battered 

women be allowed entry into the association but those who 

work with the handicapped be denied? 

 

I also question why the five-year time line is being enforced.  

Why does five years experience allow you to become licensed 

as a social worker?  Is this an arbitrary cut-off?  Will 

exceptions be made?  What 

happens to those who will fall through the cracks?  Where do 

you draw the line? 

 

However I will get into this issue during committee and look 

forward to hearing the answers to my questions at that point. 

 

Another issue that I and my colleagues will spend some time 

on during committee is how the fee structure will be enforced.  

Is there or will there be provisions in the Bill to ensure that no 

qualified member will be denied access to the association 

because of inability to pay the fee?  I think that a provision like 

this is important. 

 

Of course I will clarify the matter during committee, but I am 

thinking of new graduates from the Faculty of Social Work 

who may not be able to afford the entrance fee to the 

association.  New graduates, Mr. Speaker, do not have the 

ready cash.  A lot put themselves through school by holding 

down a job and have a batch of student loans to pay off as well 

-- student loans which can amount, many university students 

find, to numerous and a lofty amount of dollars when they get 

out of school.  In order to earn money they will need money to 

join the association.  It is a catch-22, Mr. Speaker.  Will these 

people be denied access to the association? 

 

Another question in this regard deals with social workers 

employed by the government.  Who will be paying the 

association fee, the employee or the taxpayers of 

Saskatchewan? 

 

The minister mentioned in her remarks that the standards and 

ethics established by the Saskatchewan Association of Social 

Workers will be reviewed and approved by the Minister of 

Social Services and the Legislative Assembly to ensure that 

they are in the best interests of the public.  I am encouraged 

that the standards will be brought to the Assembly for 

discussion and approval.  I want to confirm this fact as well in 

committee. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to note that this Bill 

enforces that the governing body of the association will be duly 

elected, and this is indeed good.  The Bill provides that only 

one member of the five will be appointed.  I recall, Mr. 

Speaker, that the member from Riversdale, the Premier of this 

province, I recall when he promised that all government 

appointments would be approved by a committee of this 

legislature.  He promised that all appointments would be 

scrutinized by members of this Assembly. 

 

This Bill allows the government to appoint a member of the 

governing body of the association of social workers.  This 

breaks the Premier's promise.  We will be asking why.  We will 

be asking if indeed the government will allow this Assembly to 

have input into that appointment.  I am not surprised by this, 

but it is something that I will be questioning the minister on in 

committee as well. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I will also be asking the minister who was 

consulted in the formation of this Bill, and what 



270 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

impact the Bill will have on the social workers across the 

province.  I would be remiss if I concluded my remarks on Bill 

7 without pointing out the irony of the NDP government 

introducing this legislation.  This Bill will essentially legitimize 

social work as a profession, a helping profession, a profession 

that assists the unemployed, the impoverished, the physically 

and emotionally unhealthy. 

 

Social workers help those people who were forced into this 

very fate by the NDP government and their policies of today.  

The NDP government has forced so many people into the 

welfare rolls that they had to use special warrants to obtain 

additional funds.  They had to use special warrants, something 

they claim to abhor, something they swore they would never 

use, in order to obtain money to help the increased levels of 

people on social assistance.  This is a fact and this is something 

that social workers must deal with daily. 

 

This government is creating more work for social workers.  Mr. 

Speaker, social workers will have even more unemployed, and 

even more distraught, and even more downtrodden people to 

deal with after next week's budget, I am afraid.  I believe that 

the lack of vision of this government and pessimistic nature is 

driving people out of the province and into a position where 

social workers are going to find that the workload that they are 

finding difficult to carry today is even going to become greater 

tomorrow. 

 

(1630) 

 

Mr. Speaker, it's been my pleasure to address some of these 

important issues.  I also know my colleagues would like to 

raise some of the issues and I will allow them to enter debate, 

but I will assure you, Mr. Speaker, that we will raise these and 

other questions as we get into committee as well.  Thank you, 

Mr. Speaker. 

 

Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  Why is the member on her feet? 

 

Hon. Ms. Atkinson: -- Mr. Speaker, I'd ask for leave to 

introduce some guests. 

 

Leave granted. 

 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 

Hon. Ms. Atkinson: -- Mr. Speaker, it's indeed a pleasure to 

introduce to you, and to all members of the legislature, 42 

people who are in the west gallery who are here with the 

Saskatoon Open Door Society.  The 42 citizens are people 

who've recently arrived in Canada from around the world, as I 

understand it.  It's not unlike the situation that many of our 

grandparents or parents found themselves in when they first 

came to our country.  And so I'd like to welcome the new 

citizens to the legislature and to Saskatchewan and to Canada. 

 

Along with the 42 people are their teachers: Donald 

Campbell, Jeanette Dean, Barbara Petrie, and Kurt Stang.  

Welcome to the legislature and I hope you have a safe ride 

home. 

 

Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 

 

ADJOURNED DEBATES 

 

SECOND READINGS 

 

Bill No. 7 (continued) 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  The member 

from Moosomin brought forward many good points concerning 

this Bill.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, the opposition member 

responsible for Social Services is in the hospital at the present 

time, and hopefully he will be able to join us next week.  I 

know that he's anxious to take part in the debate, talking about 

Bill 7.  I hope that at such time he will have the opportunity to 

deal with it. 

 

Because of that, Mr. Speaker, I would move at the present time 

we adjourn debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 4 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 

motion by the Hon. Ms. Carson that Bill No. 4 -- An Act 

respecting Local Improvements in Urban and Northern 

Municipalities and to Effect Certain Consequential 

Changes be now read a second time. 

 

Mr. Goohsen: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I want to say a few 

things about this Bill, Mr. Speaker.  The comment made by my 

colleague about the member from our caucus responsible for 

Social Services, was it?  I met with him and visited with him 

yesterday, and I can assure you that he's feeling much better.  

The bone that was pressing on the nerve in his back has been 

removed.  And he says he will be able to kick the dickens out 

of the NDP when he gets back. 

 

Mr. Speaker, I have a number of concerns regarding the 

principle of this Bill, particularly in light of recent events 

surrounding local government and local government finance.  

The minister in her remarks explained that allocating costs and 

supporting local improvements financially is central to the 

principle of this Bill, and I agree.  I agree that that is true. 

 

The minister in her remarks specifically said, and I quote: 

 

 The Bill offers some municipalities more choices as to how 

the costs may be (better) allocated to achieve greater equity 

and better reflect the degree of benefit received. 

 

Well, Mr. Speaker, let me tell you that what the Bill does not 

do, because it is . . . in its own missions it undermines the very 

principles the minister claims to be promoting.  The Bill does 

not prevent the provincial government from offloading its 

financial 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 271 

responsibilities onto local government.  Every time the NDP 

government offloads onto our municipalities, local 

improvements pay the price. 

 

And I want to explain something to the minister that will be 

explained in this Assembly many, many times during this 

session.  The central principles of all Bills regarding municipal 

governments should be a recognition that revenue raised from 

the property should be used to service property.  Revenue 

raised from property should be used to provide services to the 

property.  And that in particular is what local improvement 

legislation should embody. 

 

But we do not see that principle in this Bill, Mr. Speaker.  We 

do not see in this Bill any measure to fend off the many 

ministers of Finance on the government side who are trying to 

say money that local governments need to use for local 

improvements must be used to fund social services.  There is 

no resistance on government benches to that political agenda, 

and therefore there is no resistance to that agenda contained 

within this Bill. 

 

Local improvements are the lifeblood of any municipality, Mr. 

Speaker.  They are the lifeblood of the urban municipalities and 

they are the lifeblood of rural municipalities.  And this Bill 

stands in direct contradiction to the government's actions 

almost across the board -- the government's actions in cutting 

off the supply of that lifeblood. 

 

For example, Mr. Speaker, how can this Bill speak to principles 

of local improvement in rural municipalities when the Premier 

is preparing to completely destroy the Department of Rural 

Development?  How can this minister stand up on behalf of 

that Premier and pretend that she cares about local 

improvements, when the department that does the most to 

make the provincial contribution to such improvements is on 

the chopping block?  The chopping block, Mr. Speaker -- that 

means cutting it out altogether and eliminating it. 

 

Well, Mr. Speaker, this Bill, with whatever benefits it contains, 

shows the fundamental characteristics of the NDP government.  

And those fundamental characteristics can be summarized as 

follows: an unwillingness to keep commitments; an 

unwillingness or an inability to be truthful; an uncompromising 

need to blame others and avoid responsibilities; a deep, 

reprehensible pattern of unfairness; a complete abandonment of 

compassion and caring; an unrelenting campaign of despair, 

and finally, Mr. Speaker, an inability to come to terms with the 

genuine financial economic management. 

 

These principles are all present in the presentation of this Bill, 

Mr. Speaker, and I propose to show you how they are present.  

Let us start at the first characteristic of this Premier and his 

government and how these characteristics are reflected in the 

presentation of this Bill. 

 

The first is an unwillingness to keep commitments or what 

more plainly is called breaking promises.  The 

NDP, in opposition, made direct commitments to local 

government, and particularly made promises regarding local 

improvements which is what this Bill is all about.  The now 

Premier stood on many occasions before the local government 

representatives and gave his word that if he were to become 

Premier their worries would be over. 

 

Even more directly and even more shockingly, Mr. Speaker, 

the woman who is now the minister, the member from Melfort, 

repeatedly and clearly committed to the increased support for 

local improvement and spent a great deal of time condemning 

the previous government for providing insufficient support to 

local improvements this Bill contemplates.  She made 

speeches, the like of which would never indicate any concern 

about deficits or fiscal responsibility. 

 

Yes, both the Premier and the minister made direct, clear, and 

unequivocal commitments that touch on the principles of this 

Bill. 

 

And what is interesting, Mr. Speaker, is the self-delusion going 

on on the government benches.  Undoubtedly the Premier will 

have one of his back-benchers stand up and wave the little 

NDP card and say, we never made any promises and we never 

made any. 

 

And while they may not have printed the promises to local 

government leaders on the card, municipal leaders know that 

this was said to them in a very direct way.  The people who had 

all of these promises made to them, they don't really care 

what's been printed on anybody's card. 

 

What they want to know is where this promised support for 

local improvements is.  Where does this Bill embody the 

principles enunciated by the NDP leader when he was so 

desperately seeking the premiership?  It's like the television 

commercial: if you come up short, use the card.  Well that's the 

slogan for the American Express, Mr. Speaker, and now 

apparently the Leader of the NDP used the card.  But the card, 

Mr. Speaker, does not help local government waiting for the 

promises of the NDP to be kept. 

 

And this Bill does not deliver on the NDP promises about local 

improvements.  So that's the first principle, the first 

characteristic of the NDP as it applies to this Bill -- an 

unwillingness to keep commitments. 

 

The second characteristic is very much related to the first, and 

that second characteristic has to do with the misinformation, 

untruths, and unwillingness to be truthful.  When local 

governments ask the province, where is your share of local 

improvements, where is your share, the Premier of 

Saskatchewan answers, I have no choice.  Now that is not true, 

Mr. Speaker, not true at all. 

 

The Premier tells local government it has a huge debt, so you'll 

have to take on all the province's responsibility in this regard.  

And that is not true either, Mr. Speaker.  Local government 

would be content if 



272 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

this government simply stopped siphoning off local funds. Just 

stop taking their money and they'll be happy. 

 

You know, Mr. Speaker, this government claims that its 

predecessor, the previous PC (Progressive Conservative) 

government spent too much money on municipal capital 

projects and local improvements.  But that's just ridiculous, Mr. 

Speaker.  Municipalities were cut back dramatically by the 

previous government.  Their funding was reduced year after 

year, no question about it, but there was some real commitment 

to local governments, not a complete abandonment. 

 

In fact we heard at the SARM convention the day before 

yesterday, Mr. Speaker, that the Department of Rural 

Development is now receiving less money than it did in 1982.  

This was the presentation of figures by the president himself. 

 

And even retaining the modest commitment this Premier and 

this government says was too much now, how the tune has 

changed, Mr. Speaker, how the tune has changed.  So local 

governments know because they lived through it, they know 

that they have not been getting huge amounts of money from 

the province, but now they find not only are they being cut 

back, they now have a provincial government that is directly 

taking money that is municipal money, directly taking money 

that's money out of the municipalities and putting it into the 

provincial kitty -- fine revenue, for example, Mr. Speaker. 

 

The government is absconding with the towns' and the cities' 

fine revenue, and every dollar they rip out of the towns is a 

dollar that must be replaced with one that could have paid for 

streets or rebuilt water works. 

 

This Bill is almost a farce coming from this government, 

almost a farce, Mr. Speaker, because while the Bill itself has 

benefits within it, it is being presented by a government with 

no commitment to the principles inherent in the Bill itself, a 

government with no commitment to local government, let alone 

local improvements. 

 

Now what about the third characteristic that is reflected in the 

presentation of this Bill, the need of compulsion to blame 

others, Mr. Speaker.  Now how is that reflected in the 

principles presented in this Bill?  Did the minister stand in this 

House and announce that central to the introduction of this Bill, 

she knows that a key principle is that the province accepting 

responsibility for its share of local government improvements, 

needs, and local improvement policy? 

 

Did she announce that the government recognizes the 

municipal revenues should be used for municipal purposes 

such as local improvements and not for health care?  Did she 

announce any of that, Mr. Speaker?  Not on your life and not 

on mine, not likely. 

 

Instead of presenting this Bill, this government is at the same 

time offloading responsibilities for all manner of things onto 

local governments.  You know, it is passing 

strange that we have a Premier who gets an overpayment from 

the Government of Canada and the national government says, 

we understand; you are in tough times.  They said, we 

understand and so we are not going to make you pay it back all 

at once, and you don't even have to start paying now.  And I 

think that's a pretty good deal for them to get.  We all knew that 

it was likely these overpayments were developing, but despite 

that, in recognition of your important responsibilities, we are 

going to adjust things so that you can accommodate the 

financial situation. 

 

(1645) 

 

And the Premier in response, Mr. Speaker, declared this to be 

-- his words -- fiscal terrorism.  He cries about Ottawa 

offloading responsibilities and talks about fiscal terrorism, and 

then he goes to the local government in this province and he 

says, well it's up to you guys; don't expect me to take the 

responsibility.  Fiscal terrorism, indeed. 

 

Specifically in regards to local improvements, the federal 

government offers a cost sharing program to build roads and 

infrastructure, and this government turns its nose.  The towns 

and the cities and the RMs of this province would give their 

eye-teeth if this province and this provincial government were 

to offer them a major cost sharing program to pave the streets 

and rebuild the water and sewer systems.  But what do we see 

instead?  A complete abdication of responsibility.  It's not up to 

us, says the Premier. 

 

What about the next principle, Mr. Speaker?  What about the 

unfairness we see not in the Bill itself but in the principles of 

the Bill in its presentation to this Assembly? 

 

We see a government that is pitting one local government 

against another -- a government that is set on a 

divide-and-conquer strategy that is worse and most harmful 

kind of policy that can be imposed on the province much in the 

need of community spirit and hope.  Instead we have a 

government that represents Bills and operates policies based on 

a creation of second-class towns and third-class municipalities 

-- a government that has completely lost any concept of 

compassion for fairness. 

 

You know, Mr. Speaker, that local improvements do not spring 

from the ground and build themselves.  They need an economic 

base and a policy base upon which to grow. 

 

Where do we see the supporting principles in the presentation 

of this Bill that would provide that economic base and those 

sound policies?  We do not see them.  Instead we see the 

government creating winners and losers, those with a modest 

future and those facing only doom.  We see a campaign of 

despair designed to drive the people into submission -- and 

submission of course it will be, Mr. Speaker.  And from despair 

can come no streets and no fire halls and no police stations.  

From this despair comes decaying infrastructure we experience 

in almost every community in this province. 



March 11, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 273 

It does not have to be this way, Mr. Speaker.  The government 

does have choices, lots of them, but they are unwilling to make 

the choices that would give meaning to this Bill.  They are 

unwilling to make the choices that would give life to the words, 

local improvements.  They are unwilling to engage in a genuine 

financial or economic management, and would rather engage in 

blame and disaster. 

 

The choices this government is making in regards to local 

government, as in regard to all of the areas of public policy, are 

designed only to maximize the interests of the NDP and have 

nothing whatsoever to do with the well-being of our people. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, while I say the specifics of this Bill are pretty 

sound, it is presented on the basis of an unacceptable principle.  

I know that my colleagues will have some comments to make 

on the principles on this Bill in the future, so I therefore move 

adjournment of debate. 

 

Debate adjourned. 

 

Bill No. 5 

 

The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 

motion by the Hon. Ms. Carson that Bill No. 5 -- An Act to 

amend The Planning and Development Act, 1983 be now read 

a second time. 

 

Mr. Toth: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, it's again 

a privilege to stand in this Assembly and to speak to Bill No. 5, 

The Planning and Development Amendment Act. 

 

And as we have indicated earlier, Mr. Speaker, a number of the 

Bills that have been brought forward, we certainly have a 

number of questions, a number of concerns, although in many 

cases most of the Bills before the Assembly, other than two or 

three, really aren't that controversial.  But it is incumbent upon 

us as an opposition to indeed take the time to look into the 

Bills, to review the Bills, and review the matter of the Bills 

before we allow them to proceed through this House. 

 

And regarding Bill No. 5, An Act to amend the Planning and 

Development Act, 1983, I would like to just make a few 

comments prior to allowing more of my colleagues or other 

members of the opposition to as well raise questions and direct 

some of our thoughts on our second reading speeches regarding 

the Bill before we would proceed to committee. 

 

In its specifics, Mr. Speaker, this Bill is really not 

objectionable.  The minister said that the amendments were 

requested by SUMA and that the Bill has been reviewed by 

SUMA as well.  I'm sure that my colleague, the member for 

Kindersley, responsible for urban affairs will have contacted 

and certainly, if he hasn't had the chance of really consulting 

with SUMA, will take the time, and would like to take some 

time, to review with SUMA representatives the contents of this 

Bill so that indeed, as we allow the Bill 

to proceed, we are indeed following some of the wishes and the 

guidelines in making certain that any concerns that would be 

out there are being addressed. 

 

The reason we do that, Mr. Speaker, is because on many 

occasions we have been led to believe by ministers of this 

government one thing and, on the other hand, a few days later 

another concern has been raised.  Or indeed one thing that was 

said in the House may not have really been acted upon; that in 

fact the other took effect. 

 

I wish I could just take the minister's words for it and quickly 

allow the Bill to pass into committee.  And having been on the 

government side of the House, certainly as government 

members and as ministers, it was a lot more appropriate and a 

lot easier just to allow Bills to come to the Assembly and hope 

that the opposition would just . . . wouldn't take a lot of time in 

speaking to the Bills or even raising questions, but allow them 

to proceed. 

 

But that's not exactly the reasons for the House to sit here and 

discuss matters such as this.  It's our responsibility of all 

members in this Assembly, not just opposition members, but all 

members of the Assembly to conscientiously address the 

questions and the decisions of this House because the decisions 

made in this House affect all people across Saskatchewan.  And 

certainly Bill No. 5 in its effect may have more and greater 

concern to SUMA and SUMA delegates, but indirectly it 

affects each and every one of us as taxpayers.  And therefore 

it's just not that simple for us as members of the opposition just 

to accept the minister's word as being truth. 

 

We want to do our research and make sure that indeed the 

minister has taken time to consult with the organizations that 

will be affected by the Bill.  For example, Mr. Speaker, I just 

want to remind the House of comments made by the Minister 

of Health recently in her introduction of Bill No. 3 and all the 

consultation process. 

 

What we have found, Mr. Speaker, is that as the minister has 

talked of consultation and my colleagues and I are aware of the 

fact that there have been many meetings around this province 

regarding health and regarding the regional health boards, but 

we have also found that as the minister may have led the House 

to believe that she had been, or had the ability to attend all of 

these meetings, indeed as we've talked to individuals the 

minister certainly wasn't able to attend all of these meetings. 

 

We trust that the Minister of Urban Affairs in her consultation 

process, if she indeed did not have the chance to personally be 

involved, indeed had representatives from her department and 

representatives from her office at these meetings so that they 

could indeed respond and get back to her on some of the 

concerns that were out there. 

 

Mr. Speaker, the minister has said a lot of things.  For example, 

prior to last year's budget the minister claimed to have 

consulted with SUMA about $11 



274 Saskatchewan Hansard March 11, 1993 

million in recreational grants that disappeared budget day.  And 

we all know the effect that that had on people across this 

province.  To our knowledge, Mr. Speaker, as we talked to 

SUMA we found that SUMA representatives were not aware at 

all of any consultation process.  They had no knowledge at all 

of the $11 million slash on their recreational grants.  And to 

rural communities, to small communities across Saskatchewan, 

that meant a severe handicap and hardship as they were then 

forced to put a greater onus on their patrons and on the 

property tax owners and on the taxpayers of those 

communities. 

 

The minister has said that she would be open and honest and 

that her government will run a tight ship with no waste and 

mismanagement.  It's therefore incumbent upon us that we 

indeed raise questions and raise any concerns that may be out 

there, so that we can be assured that the minister has been 

speaking truthfully about running a government that is not 

running under tight fiscal mismanagement with no waste. 

 

Yet we find, Mr. Speaker, the minister will not admit the real 

reason she made Carragana, Saskatchewan, the headquarters 

for SPMC (Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation).  

And we went through a fair bit of discussion in Crown 

corporations as to why Carragana was listed as the 

headquarters for Saskatchewan Property Management when the 

executive member was driving out of Regina to Carragana and 

back.  Why not have stayed in the city? 

 

So it's because of some of those concerns and some of those 

questions that were raised in other areas of discussion, Mr. 

Speaker, in other committees, that we are reluctant just to take 

the minister's word for granted.  She said she would not engage 

in patronage yet it ran rampant in SPMC when it was under her 

responsibility.  She hired the majority of her campaign team, 

Mr. Speaker, to work in her office. 

 

So, Mr. Speaker, you can see why I cannot take the minister's 

word for it when she says that SUMA was consulted on this 

Bill, and I know my colleague certainly wants to take a 

moment to be assured that SUMA was consulted, that SUMA 

had indeed the opportunity to address the Bill and address the 

input into the Bill and the ramifications of the Bill because they 

indeed will be the people that will be instituting the format and 

the requirements of the Bill. 

 

This Bill, Mr. Speaker, deals with municipal infrastructure and 

problems associated with servicing and the cost of upgrading 

municipal systems.  And all across Saskatchewan, not just 

urban Saskatchewan but rural Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker, 

many of our small towns and communities are facing major 

problems in dealing with the infrastructure and problems in 

servicing and the cost of upgrading their systems.  We see it in 

their sewer systems.  We see it in their street structures and the 

need that small communities have in arriving at the funding. 

 

And certainly, Mr. Speaker, as these communities are 

developing their budgets they're going to be watching 

with interest the government, even next week as it presents its 

budget.  And we are going to be wondering what effect this Bill 

will have on these communities as they endeavour to put in 

place the infrastructure that will build their communities for the 

future.  Redeveloping ageing systems is costly and there's no 

doubt about that. 

 

And just the other day I talked to a manager of one of our 

communities in northern . . . actually it's in the Yorkton area, 

Mr. Speaker.  A town foreman who was in here, had just spent 

I believe it was $17,000 on a piece of equipment that he was 

needing, or the town was needing, because of all the 

regulations that are now being put into place, Mr. Speaker, 

regarding safety, workers' safety.  And in their case, Mr. 

Speaker, they have a fair bit of work that must take place 

regarding the redevelopment, redesigning of their sewer and 

water system.  And he was in town to buy a cage so that indeed 

he would provide a safe working atmosphere and a place for 

the town workers as they were down digging out the streets and 

digging up the streets to redesign and re-fix the water systems 

and their sewer systems. 

 

Mr. Speaker, municipalities are struggling with funds to 

upgrade systems and this Bill allows for what the minister 

calls, development levies.  She says that development levies 

will be a new source of revenue for municipal governments, a 

new source of revenue for municipal governments. 

 

Before us today is, Mr. Speaker . . . rather than just a new 

source of revenue for municipal governments, but it would 

seem to me, as we've seen over the past number of weeks and 

over the past year and a half since the government was . . . the 

NDP party was elected to govern this province, we've seen a 

new form, and today we see this Bill bringing to play a new 

form of NDP tax, not just a new development tax. 

 

Their new creation is the development tax, and who is forced to 

collect it?  It is being put into the hands of local government.  

Mr. Speaker, the question we will continue to ask.  Okay, the 

minister will respond, well we've given it over to the local 

government to administer the collection of this tax. 

 

And, Mr. Speaker, what happens is local governments are 

again left with making decisions based on taxation revenue that 

the province has pulled out from underneath them -- the 

non-conditional grants that are being lowered, the reductions 

they are taking on non-conditional grants -- and they are going 

to have to go to the taxpayers. 

 

The Speaker: -- Order.  It now being 5 o'clock this House 

stands recessed until 7 p.m. this evening. 

 

The Assembly recessed until 7 p.m.
