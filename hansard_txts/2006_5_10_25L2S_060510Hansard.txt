INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 

 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Saskatoon Greystone. 
 
Mr. Prebble: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. It’s my pleasure to introduce several members of the 
lung association who are in the west gallery, Madam Deputy 

Speaker. 
 
We’re very fortunate this afternoon to be joined by five 
members of the lung association who are in the gallery. Starting 
on my left is Sharon Kremeniuk, who’s the staff person in the 
Regina office of the lung association; and seated next to her is 
the vice-president of the lung association for our province, 
Marilyn Reddy. And seated next to her is someone well known 
to all of us in this Assembly. A colleague, a former member of 
the legislature for Lloydminster, Violet Stanger, is in the gallery 
and she’s an active member of the lung association. We’re very 
pleased to have you here, Violet. And seated next to Violet is 
Gail and Lorne Procyshen. And Lorne is a board member from 
the Yorkton area on the lung association. 
 
So we want to welcome you here this afternoon and also to 
express special thanks for the excellent work that you do and 
that all members of the lung association do. As we know that 
there’s going to be a reception later in the day, and these five 
representatives will be joined by many other members and 
including board members and staff from the lung association. 
 
So welcome to your legislature. And I ask all members to join 
me in expressing our welcome and appreciation to these special 
guests. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I’d 
like to join with the member from Saskatoon Greystone in 
welcoming the people from the lung association to their 
Assembly on behalf of the official opposition. As the member 
mentioned, there will be a reception I believe from 5 to 7 that I 
know a number of our colleagues will be joining and learning 
some of the issues that you’ll be talking about at that reception. 
 
We know that the lung association has been instrumental in 
lobbying the provincial government and opposition on changes 
to legislation, and the most recent one of course is the banning 
of smoking in public places, which will go a long ways to 
bettering the health of our citizens in Saskatchewan. So I’d like 
to welcome you all here today. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Regina Rosemont. 
 
Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. Well today is pretty exciting. I have 26 students from 
St. Josaphat School accompanied by their teacher, Mrs. Elaine 
Pack. And you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I noted what a 
polite group of children they are. The guide was with them and 
instead of just jumping into the conversation, they put up their 
hand when they wanted to speak. And we’re going to see if the 
members of the legislature can behave as well as you can today. 
 
And I’ll be seeing you for drinks afterwards at 2:30. So could 
everybody please join me in welcoming St. Josaphat School to 
the legislature today. 
 



May 10, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1603 

Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for P.A. 
[Prince Albert] Northcote. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Thank you very much, Madam 
Deputy Speaker. I would like to today take this opportunity to 
introduce to you and through you to all members of the House 
27 grade 7 and 8 students from École Vickers School in Prince 
Albert. They’re accompanied by their teacher, Brandi 
Sherwin-Shields; chaperones, Cheryle Harris, Kerry Macintya, 
Lisa Robertson, and Ed Elliott. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I’ll be meeting with them in room 218 
after question period. I’m very much looking forward to 
meeting them on behalf of the Speaker. They may not know but 
they’re residents in the Speaker’s constituency. He’s 
unavailable today because he can’t speak. He’s got laryngitis so 
. . . But he’ll be with us shortly, I’m sure. So, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, I’d like you to join with me in welcoming these 
students from École Vickers School. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Regina Walsh 
Acres. 
 
Ms. Morin: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. It gives 
me great pleasure to introduce to you and through you and to all 
members of the Legislative Assembly four people that are 
seated in your gallery, Madam Deputy Speaker, who are very, 
very happy people that they get to live, work, and remain in 
Saskatchewan. They are workers with the Worldwide Pork 
plant in Moose Jaw and are anxiously awaiting the reopening of 
the plant. With us today, and perhaps they could stand as I 
mention their names, is Greg Tanner, Duncan McIntyre, Tim 
Andrews, and Lawrence Peverett. 
 
I would like all members of the Legislative Assembly to 
welcome them to the legislature today and wish them the very 
best in the reopening of their Worldwide Pork plant and much 
success into the future. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Moosomin. 
 

Prairie Valley School Division Heritage Fair 
 
Mr. Toth: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Recently 
the Prairie Valley School Division held its Heritage Fair in 
Wolseley. The event was hosted by Dr. Isman Elementary 
School with support from the town of Wolseley, the RM [rural 
municipality] of Wolseley as well as a number of local 
businesses. 
 
The purpose of the fair is to encourage the youth of our schools 
to learn about local, provincial, and national history. This year’s 
fair had more than 123 exhibits. Through the exhibits, students 
shared information on historic events such as First Nations 

culture, the working of a prairie elevator, agriculture then and 
now, many sporting activities such as hockey and curling, 
including an exhibit on Sandra Schmirler. 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed talking to many of the students about their 
exhibits and was amazed at the knowledge they had of their 
display, indicating the time and effort they had taken in 
planning their project. One student had a display on the War of 
1812. This young gentleman went so far as to sew his own 
uniform depicting the dress of the day. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, the organizing committee also 
arranged for tours of local historic centres such as the Banbury 
House and many historic homes and churches in the 
community. 
 
I would like to extend a special thank you to Mr. Tim Taylor, 
principal of Dr. Isman Elementary School, Dennis Fjestad, the 
staff of Dr. Isman Elementary School, and everyone who 
volunteered to help in making this year’s Heritage Fair such a 
tremendous success. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[13:45] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Saskatoon Massey 
Place. 
 

Saskatoon Achievement in Business Excellence Awards 
 
Hon. Mr. Cline: — Madam Deputy Speaker, last night I had 
the pleasure of attending the Greater Saskatoon Chamber of 
Commerce and Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan 11th 
annual Celebrate Success Awards Gala. 
 
It was a special evening for Les and Irene Dubé, founders of the 
Concorde Group of Companies, who earlier this year were 
nominated into the SABEX [Saskatoon Achievement in 
Business Excellence] Hall of Fame for their many business and 
charitable activities. And they were recognized last night. 
 
Business of the Year honours went to North Ridge 
Development Corporation. The New Business Venture award 
went to SandCastle Resort/J.E.M. Tours. In the growth and 
expansion category the award went to GC Teleservices Canada. 
The award for new product to Venmar CES Inc. For marketing, 
DSG Canada Saskatoon Diesel. In the export category, 
Container Port of Saskatchewan. For customer service, Merlin 
Ford Lincoln. 
 
The Saskatoon Blades Hockey Club won the award for 
community involvement. The Award of Innovation went to 
doctors Deborah Haines and Brian Chelack of the Western 
College of Veterinary Medicine. Marla Adams received the 
ATHENA International award, and Kent Smith-Windsor was 
recognized as Canada’s Chamber Manager of the Year. 
 
I ask all members to join me in congratulating the 2006 SABEX 
nominees and award winners on their achievements and their 
contributions to the Saskatchewan economy. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 



1604 Saskatchewan Hansard May 10, 2006 

The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Saskatoon Silver 
Springs. 
 

World Lupus Day 
 
Mr. Cheveldayoff: — Madam Deputy Speaker, today is the 
third annual World Lupus Day, a day set aside to increase 
recognition of lupus and to promote diagnosis, treatments, and 
research into a cure. 
 
On May 10 lupus organizations around the globe call for 
increases in public and private sector funding for medical 
research on lupus, targeted education programs for health 
professionals, patients, and the public, and worldwide 
recognition of lupus as a significant public health issue. 
 
World Lupus Day focuses on the need for improved patient 
health care services, a cure for lupus, enhanced physician 
diagnosis and treatment of lupus, as well as better data on lupus 
globally. A complex disease affecting many aspects of life for 
more than 50,000 Canadians, lupus is a chronic autoimmune 
disease that can strike any tissue or organ of the body including 
skin, muscles, joints, lungs, heart, kidney, and the brain. 
Symptoms of lupus can mimic other illnesses, making it hard to 
diagnosis. Therefore it is the early detection, diagnosis, and 
treatment that helps to slow the debilitating effects of the 
disease. 
 
Effective treatment can minimize symptoms, reduce 
inflammation, and improve overall quality of life. It is up to us 
to make a difference for those living with lupus by helping to 
increase awareness and understanding of the disease. Improving 
awareness of lupus symptoms will save lives. 
 
Betty Bellamy from the constituency of Saskatoon Silver 
Springs was honoured with a Centennial Medal for her tireless 
work with the Saskatchewan branch of the lupus society in 
educating people of all ages about the disease of lupus. 
 
Madam Speaker, I ask all members of the Assembly to 
congratulate Betty Bellamy for her work. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Regina Walsh 
Acres. 
 

Saskatchewan Party Position on Investment in Business 
 
Ms. Morin: — Madam Deputy Speaker, the Saskatchewan 
Party under the leadership of the member for Swift Current 
couldn’t find a consistent position on anything with two hands 
and a flashlight. Madam Speaker, a few weeks ago the member 
for Thunder Creek stood with the workers of Moose Jaw’s 
Worldwide Pork plant and called for government intervention 
to ensure the plant didn’t close. 
 
On April 26 in the Economy Committee, the same member 
questioned why Worldwide Pork couldn’t benefit from 
government investment in the pork industry, and then went on 
to say, I quote: 
 

. . . I wonder if the minister is aware that the employees 

have approximately $700,000 or 750,000 maybe in place 
for investment . . . and what they need from this 
government is some sort of backing for another 500,000. 
 

After the government announced $1.5 million to support 
Worldwide Pork, the member for Thunder Creek said this, and I 
quote: 
 

Well naturally I’m delighted the plant being close to my 
home has another shot at survival. 
 

Except he’s not delighted, or maybe he is. Who knows what he 
actually believes? After calling numerous times for the 
government to step in, now he is saying, and I quote from his 
website: 
 

We [meaning the Sask Party] don’t believe in equity 
investment or direct investment in business by . . . 
taxpayers . . . 

 
Madam Speaker, why the abrupt turnaround? Because the 
member was out of line with the Sask Party ideology, and under 
the current leader it’s politics over principle and my way or the 
highway. 
 
Madam Speaker, Brenda Bakken chose the highway. And now 
we know what the member for Thunder Creek has chosen to do 
as well. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Arm River-Watrous. 
 

Condition of Highways 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is with great 
concern I rise in the House today to again remind the Highways 
minister that Saskatchewan highways are a mess. Worse than 
that, they are now a menace to the safety of the motoring 
public. 
 
Last week I had the person from Regina that delivers 
newspapers to all the towns through my constituency stop me in 
the morning when I was picking up my newspaper to tell me 
that on Saturday he tore the gas tank off his van on Highway 
44. He says it’s a total mess. 
 
The next day I received an alarming call from a constituent who 
owns a freight business in Watrous. He said that Highway 2 
between Imperial and Watrous is now so full of large holes that 
it has become basically almost impassable, wrecking his 
vehicles as he delivers freight up and down. 
 
He also heard a story of a person near Young that lost their 
engine oil pan off their car on Highway No. 2. Also had 
numerous calls on Highway No. 20. Same thing, many potholes 
on that. The highways crews out there are basically busy just 
marking the holes. They’re so busy marking holes they don’t 
even have time to actually stop to fill them. That’s how many 
calls they’re getting at that. 
 
And what’s the response from this government, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, is to close the section shops in Watrous, take men 



May 10, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1605 

from there, take equipment from there, and cut funding to the 
Department of Highways. Madam Deputy Speaker, that is a 
shame out there in rural Saskatchewan as these highways keep 
deteriorating and this government is doing absolutely nothing to 
address that problem. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Saskatoon Eastview. 
 

Registered Psychiatric Nurses Day 
 
Ms. Junor: — Thank you. Madam Deputy Speaker, I’m proud 
to rise in this Assembly today to recognize that today is 
Registered Psychiatric Nurses Day. Madam Deputy Speaker, 
today gives us the opportunity to recognize the many 
contributions of registered psychiatric nurses. 
 
Across the province they play a key role in the delivery of 
quality mental health services in Saskatchewan. On the front 
lines of mental health services, RPNs [registered psychiatric 
nurse] are hardworking and talented health professionals 
dedicated to the people who need their care and compassion. 
And compassionate care is so vital to people living with mental 
illness and just as important to their families. 
 
At a very stressful time in their lives, patients and their families 
know they can count on registered psychiatric nurses and count 
on their competent, caring presence. Every day RPNs help their 
patients improve their coping skills and control the symptoms 
of their illness. They also provide emotional support. In short 
they help their patients achieve better mental health. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues and 
Saskatchewan citizens, I’d like to thank all registered 
psychiatric nurses for a job well done. We value their 
contributions and join them in celebrating this special day. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Cannington. 
 

Viewpoints Expressed in Letters to the Editor 
 
Mr. D’Autremont: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
The Saskatchewan people have spoken. I offer the Saskatoon 
StarPhoenix letters to the editor as proof. The first title, open 
quote: “NDP failures evident in contrast with Alberta,” aptly 
points out the results of 15 years of NDP [New Democratic 
Party] rule in this province. The writer says, open quote: 
 

I was travelling to Regina from Saskatoon on Good Friday 
and couldn’t help but notice the numerous vehicles from 
Alberta, all occupied by young people and young families. 
 
It saddened me because these were kids returning to visit 
their parents for Easter, back to the very province whose 
NDP government gave them no choice but to move away. 

 
Madam Deputy Speaker, this worn out, tired, old NDP 
government has hundreds of thousands of dollars for the 
Finance minister leadership ad campaign but no clear vision on 
how to keep young people in Saskatchewan. Speaking of that, 

Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to read from another letter to 
the editor. This one says, and I quote: 
 

The Calvert government’s broken PST promise continues, 
and the debt still rises by $285 million. The only “identity 
crisis” Cheveldayoff is having is that he’s acting like a 
responsible finance minister, unlike Andrew Thomson 
who is frittering away a half-million dollars of our money 
on an advertising campaign about the budget. 
 

Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 

Recruitment of Health Care Professionals 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
Yesterday the Minister of Health responded to how Ontario is 
now guaranteeing next year’s graduating class full-time jobs so 
that they will stay in the province. The minister said that the 
Saskatchewan graduating nurses would be guaranteed a job 
also. But he stopped far short of the commitment of Ontario 
guaranteeing them full-time, permanent positions, Mr. Speaker. 
When asked, the minister said that not all nurses want full-time 
positions. I think he’s incorrect when he talks about graduates, 
having student loans to pay back. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, will the minister commit today to 
guaranteeing full-time, permanent positions to our graduating 
nurses? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. I’ve just returned from the town of Hudson Bay where 
this morning I announced the expansion of the Hudson Bay 
long-term facility. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, the comments of individuals within 
that health facility — whether they were residents, 
administrators, doctors or nurses — were that they’re proud of 
the Saskatchewan health care system. They’re proud of the 
commitments that this government has made to support 
communities. 
 
And, Madam Deputy Speaker, that makes me very proud to be 
the Minister of Health in a government that’s made a significant 
commitment in this budget to support not only doctors and 
nurses but seniors in this province and citizens throughout 
Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Madam Speaker, we’re continually training 
nurses for export out of this province. The Saskatchewan Union 



1606 Saskatchewan Hansard May 10, 2006 

of Nurses has called on this NDP government to hire 600 
full-time positions to deal with the staffing shortages and to also 
bring the staffing shortages up so that nurses can practice at 
professional standards, so professional standards can be met. 
 
We see that other provinces are working with the nurses’ union 
to address staffing shortages and workplace conditions. In 
British Columbia the government has established a workload 
measurement system to determine the appropriate staffing level 
in their facilities. 
 
Can the minister commit today to start working with 
Saskatchewan Union of Nurses regarding their 600 positions 
and regarding workplace conditions? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. I remind the member opposite we’re already doing 
that. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, in December we issued a report 
indicating the points that we will follow dealing with workplace 
action. And we are committed to work with Saskatchewan 
Union of Nurses, Saskatchewan Registered Nurses’ 
Association, and the Saskatchewan licensed practical nurses 
association to ensure that we have more nurses working in this 
province. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, I was reviewing media reports this 
morning. I couldn’t help but find a piece printed today in The 
Financial Post printed in Canada. The quote I’d like to make 
from Lisa Little, human resource consultant with the Canadian 
Nurses Association in Ottawa, Madam Deputy Speaker: “The 
United States is going to be short one million nurses by the year 
2010, and the problem is global.”  
 
She goes on to say, Madam Deputy Speaker, “It’s not a matter 
of . . . numbers — we have to start using . . . [our] resources . . . 
more efficiently and effectively.” 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, the Canadian Union of Nurses knows 
that. The province of Saskatchewan knows that. And we’re 
going to go to work to ensure that we have more nurses 
working in this province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for Indian 
Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. On 
the issue of using people in the right places, we know that right 
now dealing with endocrinologists that there are no 
endocrinologists practising in Saskatoon. The solution of this 
government is to fly endocrinologists in from other provinces to 
deal with that. 
 
A letter written by Dr. Mohammed to the Regina Leader-Post 
. . . and he’s an endocrinologist here in Regina. On February 4, 
Dr. Mohammed goes on to say that when he sees patients, it’s 

only a one- to two-week wait; urgent cases may be seen in a 
few hours. 
 
My question to the minister is: does the Saskatoon Health 
Authority know this? Are patients from Saskatoon being 
referred to this endocrinologist in Regina? Or are they more 
content in flying people in from out of province to deal with the 
need in Saskatoon? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. The situation in Regina, as I’ve indicated previously, 
is regarded as stable. The situation in Saskatoon is described by 
individuals in the media yesterday . . . was one of being hit by 
the perfect storm. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, endocrinologists are an important part 
of the Saskatchewan system. There are many who work closely 
together. They understand where referrals need to be made at 
appropriate times. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, we leave the care decisions to the 
professionals. We don’t take responsibility for the work that the 
professionals do as politicians, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[14:00] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Member for Indian Head-Milestone. 
 
Mr. McMorris: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
Talking about the professionals, Dr. McNab, the Saskatoon 
endocrinologist who is now leaving for Edmonton, tried to get 
involved in the recruitment process for other endocrinologists in 
the area. We have heard similar stories from Dr. Boctor and Dr. 
Best who also tried to assist in recruitment of endocrinologists 
before leaving the province so their regions wouldn’t be left 
short . . . [inaudible] . . . Mr. Speaker, why is this government 
not listening to the professionals in the field when it comes to 
recruitment of other professionals? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Taylor: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. Over the years, the most recent years, Saskatchewan 
Health has worked very closely with the Saskatchewan Medical 
Association to set in place guidelines, practices, principles, and 
have assigned dollars to assist with specialists and physician 
recruitment and retention issues. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, in the next two days I will be meeting 
with the representative board and the membership of the 
Saskatchewan Medical Association. On our agenda will be this 
very subject. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 



May 10, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1607 

The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Batoche. 
 

Condition of Highway 368 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, I raised the issue of Highway 368 last week 
and received no answer from the Highways minister. This time 
I’m asking him again, and hopefully he will answer. When does 
he plan to fix Highway 368 between St. Brieux and Lake 
Lenore? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Highways. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I’ll answer the 
member opposite in this way. This fiscal year we have allocated 
$345 million for highways repair and upgrading. Obviously we 
have some challenges with the largest number of roads of any 
jurisdiction in Canada, much of it TMS [thin membrane 
surface] that is in some pretty serious strain based on the 
amount of traffic. The retention of the . . . or the Crow rate 
obviously caused more pressure on our highway system. And I 
want to say, Mr. Speaker, in light of the pressures that we’re 
facing, we’re doing the best that we can with the resources that 
we have. 
 
What I would say to that member is that perhaps he would 
speak to the leader of his party, the member from Swift Current, 
when he’s out raising funds in Ottawa, if he would maybe have 
a chat with some of his colleagues in the federal government to 
see if perhaps they would be interested in putting together a 
national infrastructure program that this province and this 
country needs very badly, Madam Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Member for Batoche. 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, I have in my hand a letter from Rita Bourgault 
which appeared on the popular website smalldeadanimals.com 
this morning. I’d like to read to you some of it, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. And I quote: 
 

You would swear you’re driving through a minefield. 
There have been 2 road accidents involving semi trailers 
that are . . . [attributed] to road conditions.  

 
Madam Deputy Speaker, Rita Bourgault said St. Brieux ships 
150 to 175 million dollars worth of equipment per year and 
pays between 70 and 100 million in taxes per year. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, you’d think the minister could fix the road. 
 
To the minister: does he believe Bourgault Industries and the 
people of St. Brieux should be forced to live with an unsafe 
highway when they contribute so much to the NDP 
government? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Highways. 
 

Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, highway safety is 
obviously first and foremost in the minds of the people who 
work . . . 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I would remind members asking 
questions, we would want to hear the answers as well. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, there’s no doubt that 
we do face some challenges here in this province. We have 
hundreds of kilometres, thousands of kilometres of thin 
membrane roads that were built in the 1950s, built in the 1960s, 
and weren’t designed to haul heavy loads that they’re forced to 
haul now because of rail line abandonment. And we do have 
some pressures. We obviously do, and no one will deny that. 
 
I want to say to that member that we have upgraded — since 
2000 — 1,100 kilometres of thin membrane roads, one of which 
he refers to. And we have more to go. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say to that member, that to upgrade all of 
the TMS roads in this province would cost just under $1 billion, 
and I want to ask that member if that’s another one of the 
commitments that the member from Silver Springs would make 
when he’s doing all of his expenditure promises in this 
province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Batoche. 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. This 
morning we heard the Minister of Industry and Resources 
announce that his department was going to spend 350,000 on an 
ad campaign promoting Saskatchewan. While we are supportive 
of this campaign, there is much work to be done here at home 
when it comes to infrastructure businesses rely on. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, Highway 368 is a disgrace. And this road is 
the heart of a multi-million dollar industry, but it stays in 
disrepair. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, can the Minister of Highways explain 
why his government is promoting how good Saskatchewan is 
for business when it hasn’t fixed the infrastructure businesses 
rely on? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Highways. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Madam Deputy Speaker, I will 
explain to that member exactly why we’re promoting this as a 
good place to do business: because we have got one of the most 
competitive tax regimes. We have got the richest resource base 
in terms of our people. We are a great place to do business, and 
it’s evidenced by our GDP [gross domestic product] growth on 
an annual basis. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Mr. Speaker, I would say to 
members on that side of the House, if they were to focus on 
what really is important in areas where they could be of 
assistance, perhaps they’d get on the phone, phone their federal 



1608 Saskatchewan Hansard May 10, 2006 

cousins and ask them why Saskatchewan isn’t getting a fair 
treatment on equalization. Maybe they would ask their federal 
cousins why they haven’t introduced a national highways 
program for this country. 
 
Mr. Speaker,  that opposition sees nothing but bad. There isn’t 
anything in this province that they ever see that’s working or 
that they ever see as good. They’re grouchy, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. They’re grouchy because they’re in opposition and 
they’re going to be grouchy for a long, long, long time because 
that’s where they’re going to stay. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Batoche.  
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The NDP 
government and the Highways minister has lost touch with the 
values and interests of Saskatchewan people. Here are some of 
the comments posted on smalldeadanimals.com about Highway 
368 and I quote: 
 

Typical of NDP gov’ts, waste millions on failed 
enterprises and neglect their areas of responsibility. The 
sooner Calvert gets the boot, the sooner people can start to 
return to Saskatchewan.  
 

Or how about: 
 

Fortunately there have not been any fatalities yet, but I 
believe the clock is ticking on that. Will it take a death or 
serious injury to get some [action] . . . ? 

 
Madam Deputy Speaker, is the Highways minister waiting for a 
fatality to happen before he takes action? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Highways. 
 
Hon. Mr. Lautermilch: — Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
small dead animals indeed — small dead political parties. 
Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a group of men and women 
who took the name of their political party and they swept it 
under the mat because of the disgrace of the 1980s led by, Mr. 
Speaker, Grant Devine, like the member from Swift Current. 
 
I want to say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that we’re well 
aware of the pressures on the infrastructure, on the highway 
system in this province. And I tell you how we’re going to fix 
all of that. It’s going to be with the resource wealth that we’ve 
been creating in oil and in gas and in potash. And I tell you, 
Madam Deputy Speaker, we’re believing that there is a future in 
agriculture as well. 
 
And I want to say in closing, Madam Deputy Speaker, that 
members on this side of the House are very upbeat about this 
economy. We’re very upbeat about our province. And the 
grouchy old men and women on the other side can just sit there 
and stew. That’s where they deserve to be, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 

The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Canora-Pelly. 
 

Appointment at the Labour Relations Board 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, for the last five days I have raised allegations 
made by former Labour Relations Board Vice-Chair, Walter 
Matkowski, that there had been political interference in his 
duties on the board. Matkowski alleges the deputy minister of 
Labour called him and told him he should resign because 
unions were not happy with his decisions. 
 
Yesterday Mr. Matkowski said he was willing to pursue 
mediation to get to the bottom of this dispute instead of going to 
court. The Labour minister told reporters that mediation is not 
an appropriate process to go through. Can the minister tell this 
Assembly why mediation is not appropriate in this case? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you very much, Madam Deputy 
Speaker. Well let me repeat this yet again. There was no 
political interference. No one was forced to resign or pushed out 
of their jobs. The term expired. 
 
Now the member for Canora-Pelly seemed to understand this in 
the past. Just last year in the spring in this Chamber, the 
member for Canora-Pelly said that it caused him tremendous 
concern to allow members of the LRB [Labour Relations 
Board] to stay on the payroll following the completion of their 
term. Well I’ll tell you, I’ll tell you this, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, what’s tremendously concerning is the Sask Party is 
. . . 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Order. Order. I would mention to all 
hon. members . . . Order. I would mention to all the hon. 
members, both with the question and the answer, we would 
want to be able to hear the response and respect the member 
who is on their feet. The Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Thank you. Well I’ll repeat that because I 
want to make sure the member for Canora-Pelly has this right. 
It caused him, and I quote “tremendous concern” to allow 
members of the LRB to stay on the payroll following the 
completion of their terms. 
 
But I tell you this, Madam Deputy Speaker, what causes me a 
lot of concern is the Sask Party has yet once again changed their 
tune, is now supporting this culture of entitlement in which 
five-year terms seem to stretch into automatic lifetime 
appointments. Madam Deputy Speaker, the opposition is just 
not credible on this. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — I recognize the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, yesterday the minister told reporters that 
mediation was not necessary because as far as he was 



May 10, 2006 Saskatchewan Hansard 1609 

concerned, there is no dispute. And yet he is aware that there 
are two sides to the story. 
 
On one side the former Vice-Chair of the Labour Relations 
Board says he was contacted by the deputy minister and told 
and to resign because his decisions were unpopular with the 
unions. On the other side the deputy minister says his 
recollections of that conversation are quite different. 
 
Clearly there is a dispute. Again to the minister: why is he 
refusing to deal with this dispute through a mediation process? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is 
quite interesting that two sides of the story seem to be coming 
out of the member opposite’s mouth. But even Mr. Matkowski 
has stated publicly that he was never interfered with in the 
course of his duties. 
 
Now clearly the issue is not political interference or bias. The 
issue is whether the government is obligated to automatically 
reappoint anyone to a position after their term has expired. But 
the fact of the matter, Deputy Speaker, that no one should 
expect that their term will be automatically reappointed. 
 
Now perhaps the member for Canora-Pelly should ask the 
member for Thunder Creek how this all works because just last 
spring the member for Thunder Creek said, and I’ll quote again, 
“. . . it is obvious to any member of the public that people in 
any job must leave their duties when . . . their mandate expires.”  
 
That’s what he said. Now . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member from Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, going through mediation as Mr. Matkowski 
has suggested could save the taxpayers of this province a lot of 
money. Yet yesterday the Minister of Labour told reporters he 
was quote, “comfortable going to court.” 
 
Can the Minister of Labour tell us why he’s comfortable going 
to court and spending taxpayers dollars instead of using an 
in-house conciliator to deal with this issue through mediation? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[14:15] 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — Well, Madam Deputy Speaker, I’ve made 
it clear, made it clear over several days that there was no 
political interference. No one was forced out of their job. The 
term simply expired. 
 
But if the members opposite want to talk about political 
interference, I’ll gladly do that, Madam Deputy Speaker, 

because I’d like to quote again from the Thunder Creek member 
just last spring, as I said yesterday, he, quote: “No amendment 
. . . should be considered . . .” 
 
Now members over there laugh, but this is what they said: “No 
amendment . . . should be considered unless the government is 
willing to remove all current members of the Labour Relations 
Board . . .” Last spring the opposition wanted to politically 
interfere with the LRB by firing every single member. And yet 
today, Madam Deputy Speaker, here they are calling for a 
culture of entitlement. Well . . . 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Time. The member for Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, yesterday, after question period, reporters 
asked the Labour minister if he was aware that his deputy 
minister had met with Mr. Matkowski’s lawyers last summer. 
The minister said he was not aware of such a meeting. Then 
later in the afternoon, the minister met with reporters again and 
said he was mistaken, and that he was indeed aware of the 
meeting his deputy minister had with Mr. Matkowski’s legal 
counsel. He said that he was confused. Well the minister need 
not worry about being confused; we’re just as confused by his 
answers. 
 
Madam Deputy Speaker, why did the minister say he was not 
aware of such a meeting when clearly he was? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — You know, let me continue here. You had 
the Thunder Creek member here saying that everybody was 
biased and they should be fired, and the member from 
Canora-Pelly telling the media a couple of days ago that he 
didn’t think the LRB was biased. 
 
And what did the Leader of the Opposition have to say? Well 
he was very clear, Madam Speaker. He wasn’t sure what he 
thought. He wasn’t sure what his thoughts were. The only thing 
he was sure of was he would change the mandate at the LRB 
and politically impose a growth agenda on them. Now if they 
appear to have any credibility whatsoever, Madam Deputy 
Speaker, I would suggest that instead of throwing out baseless 
allegations, the Sask Party needs to sit down and finally figure 
out where they stand. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — The member for Canora-Pelly.  
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Madam 
Deputy Speaker, in an article in The Star Phoenix this past 
Saturday, May 6, under the heading “Political interference 
denied,” there’s a quote from the Minister of Labour, and I want 
to read it into the record. It says: 
 

“Anyone within a department . . . if they were to . . . 
favour one way or the other trying to influence, unduly 



1610 Saskatchewan Hansard May 10, 2006 

influence a decision or a series of decisions or punish 
anyone for past decisions by some . . . reward or some sort 
of punishment, I would consider that political 
interference.” 
 

Madam Deputy Speaker, yesterday the minister has admitted 
that he knew that the deputy minister, Mr. Craik, had indeed 
contacted the lawyers. Is that not political interference? Will the 
minister stand and say that he made a wrong statement in this 
article? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Deputy Speaker: — Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Mr. Forbes: — You know, Madam Deputy Speaker, I’ve 
been very clear about this. There’s been no political 
interference. The term has expired. 
 
But I want to talk a little bit about the opposition, what they talk 
about fairness and balance in labour legislation. You know the 
opposition spouts off there has been political interference when 
clearly there hasn’t been. And based on their previous 
comments, the Sask Party would clearly political interfere with 
the LRB if ever given the opportunity. Now how’s that for fair 
and balanced? 
 
Now the Sask Party has also said they would declare war on a 
very important segment of our society — the working people 
here. Now how is that fair and balanced? The Sask Party 
opposite said they would fire every single member of the LRB 
because they don’t agree with their decisions. How’s that fair 
and balanced? 
 
And finally, how is dragging the name of yet another civil 
servant through the mud fair and balanced? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

INTRODUCTION OF BILLS 
 

Bill No. 206 — The Bio-diesel Fuel Act
