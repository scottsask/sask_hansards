 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 1063 
 May 11, 2004 
 

EVENING SITTING 
 

ADJOURNED DEBATES 
 

SECOND READINGS 
 

Bill No. 1 
 
The Assembly resumed the adjourned debate on the proposed 
motion by the Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen that Bill No. 1 — The 
Financial Administration Amendment Act, 2004 be now read 
a second time. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the member for Thunder Creek. 
 
Mr. Stewart: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This Act, Bill No. 1, 
An Act to amend the Financial Administration Act, 1993, and 
to make consequential amendments to other Acts — Mr. 
Speaker, I’m pleased to speak to this Bill. 
 
This Bill allows for summary financial statements in the 
budgeting process, and by making reference only to up-to-date 
accounting practices and budgeting and accounting processes 
that can be changed in future without amending this legislation, 
which may be a concern when it comes to openness and 
accountability. 
 
In this Bill, section 7 removes references to what must be 
included in the financial statements, and refers instead to and I 
quote: 
 

“ . . . accounting . . . (practice) established by the board”. 
 
We assume this will mean summary financial statements, as is 
the case in other provinces, and which is recommended by our 
Provincial Auditor. But there is nothing in this Bill that states 
that. 
 
In this Bill, Mr. Speaker, section 16 directs that the Provincial 
Comptroller prepare a summary financial statements in 
accordance with accounting policies of the Treasury Board. But 
the legislation, Mr. Speaker, doesn’t say what the accounting 
policies of the Treasury Board are. It’s not laid out anywhere in 
this legislation. 
 
The Bill makes changes that takes away some of the ability of 
the legislature to provide oversight and question the 
government prior to passage of the budget. 
 
In this Bill, Mr. Speaker, clause 5 allows for so-called net 
budgeting in some circumstances — revenues received that 
relate to the provision of goods or services to pay for the cost of 
those activities as cost may exceed revenues at the beginning of 
the year, of a fiscal year. Treasury Board at that time under this 
legislation may appropriate additional revenues to cover the 
difference until sufficient revenues are generated. 
 
Interim supply Bills in April may be a thing of the past if clause 
6 is implemented. If passed, it’s my understanding that 
one-twelfth of the previous year’s estimate for each department 
will be appropriated on April 1, and that will happen, Mr. 
Speaker, without any need for an interim supply Bill. It appears 

the only thing that might possibly necessitate an interim supply 
Bill would be new program funding, under this legislation. And 
this legislation also states that sums appropriated cannot exceed 
one-twelfth of the previous year’s estimate. It appears interim 
supply may still be necessary in subsequent months. This is 
unclear, however, in the legislation. 
 
The Bill makes some changes regarding electronic 
documentation and allows one department to charge another 
department for a provision of a service. 
 
Mr. Speaker, with the ambiguities that are glaring in this Bill 
and the need for more clarification, I move to adjourn. 
 
Some Hon. Members: Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the member for 
Thunder Creek that debate on Bill No. 1 be now adjourned. Is it 
the pleasure of the Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. 
 
Debate adjourned. 
 
The Speaker: — I recognize the Government House Leader. 
 
Hon. Mr. Van Mulligen: — Thank you. Mr. Speaker, I move 
the House do now adjourn. 
 
The Speaker: — It has been moved by the Government House 
Leader that this House do now adjourn. Is it the pleasure of the 
Assembly to adopt the motion? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Agreed. 
 
The Speaker: — Motion is carried. This House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. 
 
The Assembly adjourned at 19:10.
