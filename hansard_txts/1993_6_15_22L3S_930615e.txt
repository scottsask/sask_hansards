 LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY OF SASKATCHEWAN 2549 

 June 15, 1993 

 

EVENING SITTING 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I would ask for leave to return to 

private members' motions. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I understand it's motions for returns 

(debatable). 

 

Leave granted. 

 

MOTIONS FOR RETURNS (Debatable) 

 

Return No. 3 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Mr. Speaker, I move that an order of the 

Assembly do issue for a return showing: 

 

 Regarding the Crown Investments Corporation of 

Saskatchewan, the number of people that had their 

employment terminated for any reason in the month of April, 

1992, and provide: (a) the name, (b) salary, (c) title, (d) 

severance and other payments made by reason of the 

employment termination, (e) vote under which the salary and 

other payments were made to the terminated employee, and 

(f) the name of the replacement employee, if any, and the 

vote under which that employee is paid. 

 

I move, seconded by the member from Wilkie. 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I would like to 

move an amendment to this motion, and that: 

 

 The amendment read to delete the words "in the month of 

April, 1992". 

 

I would present this motion, Mr. Speaker, seconded by the 

member from Kindersley . . . the amendment, sorry. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- The government will be voting 

against the amendment.  The reason, simply put, is that there 

are 188 of these motions.  An enormous amount of our staff 

time has gone into preparing for these.  We're simply 

unprepared for this.  We don't know if it's available, and at this 

stage in the session, we're going to vote against this 

amendment.  It is open to the members to file new motions if 

they so wish.  But we are prepared to deal with this as we have 

it, but we are not prepared to deal with it as we've amended it.  

We've not had the time to do that so we are going to vote 

against this amendment. 

 

Mr. Martens: -- I suppose that it wouldn't be in order for me to 

ask the minister a question as to whether they're going to vote 

for or against the motion.  I would assume though, however, 

that they're prepared to move to the point where they will 

accept the motion as it has been presented.  And what we'll do 

is go through the first one to find out where the game plan is 

and then deal with it from there on.  Thank you. 

 

Amendment negatived on division. 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- Technically I'm not sure if I need 

leave or not to speak again.  I'm not sure if it was concurrent 

before.  Let me just say very . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- Let me check for a minute.  I'm not sure 

whether you have spoken or not.  I don't believe the member 

has spoken to the main motion, therefore he may speak again. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- We have just provided to the official 

opposition an amendment.  At the conclusion of my remarks, 

which will be extremely brief, we're going to delete parts (3) 

and (4) and make (5), (3) and (6), (4) and so on.  The basic 

reason we are doing this is that the information is provided in 

answers (1) and (2) and is not compiled separately.  So in just a 

second here . . . It's not precisely as we've given it to the 

opposition, and it's just to see if you're going to read this or not.  

Actually what I'm going to do is delete part (c) and (d), make 

(e), (c), and (f), (d).  I just inserted the numbers to see if you're 

following closely. 

 

An Hon. Member: -- Yes, which ones were you going to 

delete? 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- We're going to delete part (c).  Now 

that may be simpler.  With apologies to the page, I am going to 

now move we: 

 

 Delete parts (c) and (d) and make (e), (c), and (f), (d). 

 

I so move, seconded by the member from Moose Jaw 

Wakamow. 

 

The Speaker: -- I will have to ask the member, somebody, to 

explain this to me because I . . . 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- . . . but perhaps not that clearly.  We 

are deleting (c) and (d); renumbering (e) as (c) and (f) as (d).  

The comments under "rationale" have been stroked out and are 

not part of the motion. 

 

The Speaker: -- If the member . . . Order.  If I can maybe be of 

some assistance to the House in making an intelligible 

amendment out of this by simply saying the following: 

 

 That the amendment will delete (c) and (d), and renumber (e) 

and (f) as (c) and (d). 

 

Is that what the member . . . 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- Yes, that's right. 

 

The Speaker: -- Will the members therefore take that as the 

amendment: 

 

 To delete (c) and (d) and renumber (e) and (f) as (c) and (d). 

 

Does everybody understand the amendment? 

 

Amendment agreed to on division.

the salary and other payments are made to the terminated

Mr. Speaker, I would move that motion, seconded by the

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I wonder if we might save ourselves 

some time here.  It is our intention to give assent to the motions 

leading up to No. 74.  I think therefore it's really unnecessary 

for the members to read them.  I just ask the Speaker's advice 

on this, but I think if the member stood up and said, I move, 

seconded by the member from Wilkie, or whatever, that this 

Assembly do move an order for Return 37, and leave it at that 

without reading it, I don't think it's necessary to read them, and 

we'll speed through this process a little quicker. 

 

The Speaker: -- Just give me a moment.  Certainly that can be 

done by leave.  It's up to the members.  If they wish to expedite 

the matters faster, they can certainly do that.

Return No. 77 



June 15, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 2553 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I move, 

seconded by the member from Kindersley, that an order of the 

Assembly do issue for return no. 77 showing. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- For reasons previously given, I will 

move, seconded by the member from Saltcoats: 

 

 That we delete parts (b) and (c) and add to (a) the following: 

 

 "within the minister's responsibility." 

 

Amendment agreed to. 

 

Motion as amended agreed to on division. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- For the assistance of the House, there 

are going to be similar amendments to the next series of them.  

And I wonder if it's necessary to poll the members.  I wonder if 

we could just agree.  I'm trying to speed this thing up a little.  If 

we could just agree that the amendments, if they say on 

division, they don't need to be polled separately.  So you'd just 

call it . . . 

 

The Speaker: -- If members are moving amendments to these 

motions, would you please put the return no. on these 

amendments so that we can distinguish which amendments 

apply to which order. 

 

Now would the member . . . Order.  Would the Government 

House Leader repeat what his request was. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I'm just trying to speed this process 

up.  We have a lot of these motions and it's not very productive 

use of this Assembly time to be ritualistically going through 

them.  I was suggesting when you call the vote, if the Speaker 

wanted to just call the vote and if he hears yeas and nays, don't 

need to poll the sides separately.  It's just wasting time.  It was 

just a simple suggestion.  I don't know. 

 

The Speaker: -- Order, order.  I think we will follow the order 

that we've been doing.  I think we've had enough trouble 

already to keep the amendments in order, and if the members 

cooperate, I think we will get through this in no time. 

 

Return No. 78 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I move, 

second by the member from Kindersley, that an order of the

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I'm going to be deleting . . . I'm going 

to be moving a motion at the end of my comments which will 

delete parts (3) and (4) and renumber (5) as (3) and (6) as (4). 

 

The reason for this is that this information is not kept by SGI 

(Saskatchewan Government Insurance) and we do not have it 

on file, so we will have to delete that.  But we are providing the 

members with such information as we have. 

 

I therefore move, seconded by the member from Nipawin:

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I'm going to be deleting parts (1), (2), 

(3), (5), and I'm going to be moving some substitutions 

therefor.  I think members will agree when they've had an 

opportunity to read it.  It provides them with largely the same 

information; it simply words the questions in a better fashion 

and words them in a way in which we can provide the 

information.  We're not always able to provide the information 

as it was originally asked. 

 

I therefore move, seconded by the member from Indian 

Head-Wolseley: 

 

 delete parts (1), (2), (3) and (5) and substitute therefor: 

 

 (1) What coverage exists for Saskatchewan residents under 

the prescription drug plan? 

 

 (2) What type of coverage existed for diabetics who use 

insulin in 1991? What type of coverage exists today for 

diabetics after they changed the drug plan? 

 

 (3) What is the total cost of all types of oxygen in the year 

ending March 31, 1992? 



2562 Saskatchewan Hansard June 15, 1993

opposition have been provided with a copy of this.  We'll be 

deleting parts 3(b), (c), and (d).  The information simply isn't 

available.  No logs and no proper records were kept.  I 

therefore move, seconded by the member from Saskatoon 

Eastview-Haultain: 

 

 delete (3)(b), (c), and (d). 

 

Amendment agreed to on division. 

 

Motion as amended agreed to. 

 

Return No. 208 

 

Mr. Britton: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I move, 

seconded by the member from Morse, that an order of the 

Assembly do issue for a return no. 208. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- Again a slight wording change here. 

There were no bed closures at the Regina Wascana.  We're 

going to provide you with a bed complement there.  I therefore 

move, seconded by the member from Saskatoon Wildwood: 

 

 delete everything after "Wascana Rehabilitation Centre" and 

substitute therefor: 

 

 "What bed complement changes have the Regina health 

board approved for the Wascana 

Rehabilitation Centre during 1993-94?" 

 

Amendment agreed to on division. 

 

Motion as amended agreed to. 

 

Return No. 212 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move, seconded by 

the member from Wilkie, that an order of the Assembly do 

issue for a return no. 212. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- There is a typo here.  There's a 

double negative.  I'll therefore be moving, seconded by the 

member from Saltcoats: 

 

 That in part (2) we delete the word "not". 

 

Amendment agreed to. 

 

Motion as amended agreed to. 

 

Return No. 213 

 

Mr. Martens: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I move, seconded 

by the member from Wilkie, that an order of the Assembly do 

issue for a return no. 213. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- We're going to have an amendment.  

There's one wording change.  We're not able to give copies of 

the correspondence.  Some of the correspondence was 

confidential.  Letters to us were confidential and our responses 

were confidential. 

 

I'll therefore move, seconded by the member from 

Assiniboia-Gravelbourg: 

 

 in part (1) delete the word "workmens'" and substitute 

therefor: "workers'"; 

 

 in part (1) delete the words "any member of the Government 

of Saskatchewan" and substitute therefor: "the Department of 

Labour"; 

 

 in part (1) delete the words "business community" and 

substitute therefor: "all organizations"; and 

 

 delete parts (2), (3), and (4). 

 

Amendment agreed to on division. 

 

Motion as amended agreed to. 

 

Return No. 215 

 

Mr. Boyd: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I move, seconded by 

the member from Wilkie, that an order of the Assembly do 

issue return for motion no. 215. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I'm going to be urging the Assembly 

to defeat this.  Members . . . the opposition caucus is provided 

with copies of the order in councils on a weekly basis, so there 

appears to be little reason to accumulate this all over again.  



June 15, 1993 Saskatchewan Hansard 2563 

They're already in your files.  So I will be -- with those 

comments - urging the Assembly to defeat this motion. 

 

Motion negatived on division. 

 

Return No. 217 

 

Mr. D'Autremont: -- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I move, 

seconded by the member from Kindersley, that an order of the 

Assembly do issue for return no. 217 showing. 

 

Motion agreed to. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I move that we move to Committee 

of Finance.  I would advise members there may be some delay 

while we bring on the Department of Executive Council. 

 

The Speaker: -- I need to have someone else move that 

motion. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I'd ask for leave to withdraw the 

motion placed before the House.  Apparently the matter to 

which the Premier and members of the opposition . . . is 

running very late and they're not expected to be back in 

anything like a sensible hour. 

 

I will therefore ask leave to withdraw the motion to go to 

Committee of Finance, and if I've got that, I'll make another 

motion. 

 

The Speaker: -- That wasn't a motion.  The member may 

proceed. 

 

Hon. Mr. Shillington: -- I therefore move the House adjourn. 

 

The Assembly adjourned at 9:10 p.m.
