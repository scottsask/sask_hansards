To the Minister of Learning: how many foreign students 
were enrolled in each semester in each faculty at the 
University of Regina in the year 2004? 

 
And, Mr. Speaker, I have similar questions for the years 2003 
and 2002. I so present. 
 

INTRODUCTION OF GUESTS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Elphinstone. 
 
Mr. McCall: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. It is my 
pleasure to introduce to you and through you to the members of 
the Legislative Assembly, 19 students from Thomson 
Community School, seated in the western gallery. They’re in 
grade 6, and they’re accompanied by their teacher, Heather 
Walton, and teacher assistant, Wendy Cowan. 
 
And I think it’s important to note that Thomson Community 
School was one of the first schools in the city of Regina, Mr. 
Speaker. It’s one of the most diverse, certainly. It embodies our 
provincial motto, “from many peoples, strength.” For history 
buffs in this place, it’s interesting to note that Clarence Fines 
was once a vice-principal there, Mr. Speaker; M.J. Coldwell 
was a principal there, Mr. Speaker. And they keep up that 
excellent tradition to this day. 
 
The Minister of Learning had opportunity to visit there last 
week, and he informs me it’s one of the most favourite schools 
for him in all the province. So good work to them. I look 
forward to meeting them later, Mr. Speaker, and I ask all 
members to join me in welcoming them to their Assembly. 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Meadow Lake. 
 
Hon. Mr. Sonntag: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would ask 
colleagues in the legislature to join me in welcoming two young 
gentlemen seated in the west gallery. 
 
First of all I would like to introduce Nicholas Stulberg. Nick’s 
mother, Carol, works in the deputy minister’s office in the 
Department of Highways and Transportation. Nick is currently 
attending the college of Lethbridge, taking environmental 
sciences, and he will be returning to Regina next year to finish 
his biology degree here at of course the University of Regina. 
 
I should also add that his mother tells us that she’s quite 
worried about his interest in politics and fears she may have an 
aspiring politician on her hands. I can tell his mother that our 
province would be in very good hands if he actually decided to 
enter into politics, and I encourage him to do that. 
 
With Nick is Ken Prokopetz. Ken is a friend of Nick’s who has 
joined him here this afternoon to watch the proceedings. He’s 
also a student and is currently finishing up his second year of 
studies at the University of Regina as well. 
 
So please, colleagues, join with me in welcoming Ken and Nick 

to the Assembly here today. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Rosemont. 
 
Hon. Ms. Crofford: — Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. In 
your gallery today, I’d like to introduce Alyssa Fullerton, a 
friend again of our Page, Arielle. We’re getting the impression 
that she has lots of friends and family. 
 
Alyssa is a theatre student at the U of R [University of Regina]. 
And I’d like you all to join me in welcoming her to the 
legislature today. 
 
Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Saskatoon Meewasin. 
 

Saskatchewan Volunteer Recognition Awards 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, last night I, along with 
the Premier, had the privilege of attending Saskatoon’s third 
annual Volunteer Recognition and Awards celebration. This 
event was sponsored by Volunteer Saskatoon and presented by 
SaskEnergy. 
 
Mr. Speaker, these awards celebrate individuals who have made 
a significant contribution to their community and whose time, 
talent, and energy have helped make Saskatchewan a better 
place for everyone. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this year’s recipients are: in the arts, Jeanne 
Walters; for community development the winner is Sergeant 
Keith Briant. The award for cultural diversity went to Barbara 
Spurr. In the family category, the winner is Del and Rosella 
Grise. For human services, Miko Hirose. The Spirit of 
Volunteerism Award went to Ron Brown. For sports and 
recreation, the recipient was Garry Harder. 
 
The Workplace Volunteer Program Award went to Sandy 
Wasylyniuk. The winner of the Youth Award is Roxanne 
Bilodeau. The President’s Award of Distinction went to Lisa 
Lambert. And the first ever recipient of the Environment Award 
is Dr. Lynn Oliphant. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating all the nominees and winners. Their benevolence 
and dedication have contributed to the quality of life we all 
enjoy, and for this we are most appreciative. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Humboldt. 
 

Undefeated Season for Humboldt AA Bronco Midgets 
 
Ms. Harpauer: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, it 



2610 Saskatchewan Hansard April 21, 2005 

gives me great pleasure today to stand and congratulate the 
Humboldt AA midget Broncos for their undefeated season of 44 
wins and 1 tie. This team of great athletes between the ages of 
15 and 17 years are from Humboldt and the surrounding 
communities of Guernsey, Lanigan, LeRoy, Jansen, and 
Watrous. 
 
The AA midget Broncos were the champions in the midget 
hockey tournaments held at Edmonton and Regina, as well as 
capturing the championship for the Centre Four League 
playoffs. No doubt, however, Mr. Speaker, the greatest 
accomplishment this season came when they were declared the 
AA midget champions for the province. 
 
I want to extend a congratulations to all the players and a huge 
thank you to their coach, Tim Klimosko; assistant coaches, Roy 
McNally and Floyd Bartel; and their manager, Shelly 
Klimosko. 
 
This team are great ambassadors for the Humboldt and 
surrounding area, and they have done their community proud. 
Congratulations to the Humboldt AA Bronco Midgets. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
[13:45] 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Yorkton. 
 

Yorkton Terriers Win 
Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League Final 

 
Hon. Mr. Serby: — Well thank you very much, Mr. Speaker. 
I’ve had this member’s statement prepared for a couple of days 
now. I want to say this, that all of Saskatchewan is talking about 
the Yorkton Terriers defeating the North Battleford North Stars 
in the seventh and deciding game of SJHL [Saskatchewan 
Junior Hockey League] final last night, Mr. Speaker, in 
Yorkton. And as I told my colleague, the member from North 
Battleford, yesterday that the North Stars had their work cut out 
when they went into Yorkton last night and that he would need 
to have his chequebook ready as well, Mr. Speaker. 
 
And as the Hounds and the Bruins and the North Stars can 
attest, it was very difficult to take a bite out of the Terriers on 
their home turf. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the Terriers were 
victorious in 10 of 11 post-season home games. And as a result 
of their territorial instincts, the Terriers have claimed the 
Credential Cup, the symbol of supremacy in the Saskatchewan 
Junior A Hockey. 
 
And what’s next for the Terriers, Mr. Speaker? Well let me tell 
you. On Friday the boys are off to Portage la Prairie to muzzle 
the eastern Terriers in what I anticipate to be a hard-fought, but 
very short series. And from there our Terriers will advance to 
the Royal Bank Cup Tournament which will be held in 
Weyburn from May 7 to 15. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, I ask all members and the member from 
North Battleford to make his donation and all hon. members to 
extend their congratulations and best wishes to the Yorkton 
Terriers as they continue to demonstrate to the nation that the 

best hockey players are found in Saskatchewan, Mr. Speaker. 
Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Rosetown-Elrose. 
 

Tribute to Rosetown-Elrose Centenarians 
 
Mr. Hermanson: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Today I want to 
pay tribute to the final two of six centenarians from 
Rosetown-Elrose. 
 
Helen Erickson was born in Russia in 1902. Her father passed 
away just before she was born. Helen’s family immigrated to 
Canada and settled in Manitoba. She married in 1921 and with 
her husband and daughter, Loretta, moved to Yorkton. Helen’s 
first husband passed away in 1924, and in 1926 she, Loretta, 
and a second daughter moved to Sanctuary, near Kyle. Here she 
met Leity Erickson, and they were soon married and had a son 
in 1927. 
 
The Ericksons lived in Sanctuary and Saskatoon before Leity 
passed away in 1954. Helen then proceeded to travel the world, 
often living out of a suitcase, until she settled in Vancouver in 
1966. Her daughter, Loretta, moved her back to Kyle in 1988. 
 
Helen Erickson has lived in the Kyle Health Centre since 1992, 
and I was pleased to present her with her medallion and 
certificate on March 4. 
 
Myra Berndt of Lucky Lake passed away on February 20. She 
would have been 100 years old on July 19, so she was the sixth 
person from Rosetown-Elrose to live into our province’s 
centennial year and qualify for a medallion and certificate. 
 
Myra came to Canada from England in 1906. In 1931 she 
married Carl Berndt and they raised five children on their farm 
near Lucky Lake. Carl passed away in 1949 so Myra moved 
into town, and in May 2000 she moved into Lucky Lake Health 
Centre. 
 
I invite all members to join me in paying tribute to two special 
people, Myra Berndt and Helen Erickson, centenarians who 
have contributed greatly to our province over the past 100 
years. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Elphinstone. 
 

Regina Police Service Half Marathon 
 
Mr. McCall: — Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday in Regina over 
900 participants took part in the Regina Police Service Half 
Marathon and it was my extreme pleasure, Mr. Speaker, to have 
been one of them. I completed the 21.1-kilometre run and I am 
very pleased to be able to stand in the House today, period. 
 
Mr. Speaker, this is the second year of the RPS [Regina Police 
Service] Half Marathon. It is organized by volunteers from both 



April 21, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2611 

the community and the police service. The race offers half 
marathon distance to both competitive and recreational runners, 
and it is also open to people who wish to walk the course or 
complete it as part of a relay team. It promotes healthy and 
active lifestyles and, Mr. Speaker, it promotes positive 
engagement between members of the Regina Police Service and 
the community. As a friend of mine observed, Mr. Speaker, it’s 
always better to be running with the police. 
 
Participants were also encouraged to take part in a Walk a Mile 
in My Shoes program. There was a booth where gently used 
runners were collected for donation to Souls Harbor Mission. 
 
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate all participants but in 
particular Gilles Demers, who had the fastest time among the 
male runners at just under one hour and 20 minutes, and Jorja 
French, who was the first among female runners with the time 
of one hour and 28 minutes. 
 
I thank the hard-working volunteers, the race sponsors and 
partners for putting on a very enjoyable and successful event. 
And I can say unequivocally that I am looking forward to 
participating in the RPS Half Marathon again next year, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Batoche. 
 

Birch Hills Man Completes Roman Marathon 
 
Mr. Kirsch: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this 
evening both sides of the House have been invited to a 
reception by the Diabetes Association of Canada, so today I 
would like to relate the story of a constituent of mine from 
Birch Hills. 
 
On March ’04, David Newhouse at age 52 was diagnosed with 
type 2 diabetes. He decided he had to do something, so he 
started to run and run. Now Newhouse has just returned from 
Italy where he travelled with Team Diabetes to participate in the 
Roman marathon. The 26-mile course started and ended at the 
coliseum. Dave hoped to finish the race in under six hours. His 
official time — five hours, 59 minutes and 29 seconds. 
 
Newhouse has once again proved diabetes is not a life ending 
disease, just a life changing disease, as many in this House 
already know. Congratulations to Dave on a job well done. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Regina 
Wascana Plains. 
 

Pilot Butte School Heritage Fair 
 
Ms. Hamilton: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Celebrating our 
heritage is a big part of celebrating our provincial centennial. 
Last week I had the privilege of attending a heritage fair at Pilot 
Butte School where students displayed the results of months of 
research, writing, and project development on a heritage topic 
of their choice. 

Mr. Speaker, the fair was both informative and entertaining. 
There were 48 volunteer judges representing the community, 
parents, the school board, central office, and school staff — and 
they had their work cut out for them. There were over 150 
projects on display representing the work of almost 250 grade 4 
to 8 students, and they were exceptionally well done. 
 
The heritage fair organizers also brought in people from outside 
the school to speak with students about Saskatchewan’s rich 
cultural history. Bill Barry spoke to students about 
Saskatchewan place names. Elder Isadore Pelletier did a 
presentation for the grades 6 to 8, and Ian Brace and Eunice 
Tanner of the Royal Saskatchewan Museum presented to the 
grade 4s and 5s. 
 
I want to offer congratulations to the participants and the 
organizers of the Pilot Butte School heritage fair. It was a 
wonderful event and a great learning experience for both the 
students and members of the public who had the good fortune to 
attend. Thank you. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

ORAL QUESTIONS 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 

Crystal Methamphetamine 
 
Mr. Wall: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, my 
question’s for the Premier. When will his government establish 
a specific treatment program with specific treatment beds for 
addiction to crystal meth? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, in the budget this year 
there’s a plan for the building of the Hantelman facility in 
Saskatoon. That is going to have 12 specific beds to deal with 
youth addictions, and that’s intended to be used for crystal meth 
and other related kinds of problems. In Regina we’re also 
working on a project there as well. 
 
So those are the plans, Mr. Speaker. We do have 200-plus beds 
across the system for addictions in 13 different facilities, and 
those beds do provide services for adults and for youth. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, we would ask then the minister to 
provide some more details, both to this Assembly and to the 
families in the province of Saskatchewan who have been 
waiting for some months. You’ll remember, Mr. Speaker, this 
official opposition has been raising the issue of meth for a year 
now — well over a year. 
 
When we first raised this issue, the current Minister of Learning 
and even the Minister of Health said there didn’t need to be a 
separate program. There didn’t need to be special attention paid 



2612 Saskatchewan Hansard April 21, 2005 

to crystal meth. It looks like we’re making some progress in 
that regard. But we also know from those on the front lines of 
addictions in this province that, because of the uniqueness and 
the insidious nature of crystal meth, the 28-day intake period 
that’s normally available isn’t long enough. 
 
So we want to ask the minister this question: do these beds that 
he speaks of anticipate the unique nature of crystal meth 
addiction? And give us a date, please. Will he give us a date in 
terms of when these beds will be available to Saskatchewan 
families? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, what the member said about 
us only being involved in this recently is not true. What we do 
know, I as the attorney general . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Might I suggest the words as contrary 
to the facts. Would the minister continue. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — I accept the Speaker’s wording; they’re 
contrary to the facts. 
 
Mr. Speaker, as attorney general quite a number of years ago, 
this problem was identified to me and to our officials and to the 
people in Saskatchewan. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we have a system for addictions in Saskatchewan 
that has 244 alcohol and drug treatment beds. There’s 160 
in-patient beds, 75 detox beds, and another 9 long-term 
residential beds. And these are provided at 13 facilities. We 
have 50 intake positions, places across the province where 
people can go for addictions help and talk to addictions 
professionals. 
 
Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with crystal meth as a specific 
problem, and we’re continuing to work with this. We will be 
working with all of the people, and we have been and are 
providing services now. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, for a year we’ve been hearing from 
community leaders, the mayor of Prince Albert, the chief of the 
FSIN [Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations]. Yesterday 
the mayor of the city of Regina, joined by the Regina Police 
Service, indicated that this drug is gaining in popularity, that 
this drug is getting cheaper. It’s driving the cost down of other 
drugs. 
 
Now it’s important for the people interested in this issue, and 
there are many across the province. Many of them have a lot at 
stake. For example their children are at stake for many of the 
families that we’re taking about. It’s important for them to 
know when. Right now parents are having to send their kids out 
of the province for treatment for this crystal meth addiction. So 
we need a specific date as to when. 

And again we would ask the minister to clarify whether or not 
whatever number of beds he’s highlighting for Saskatoon will 
provide for a longer intake period. Twenty-eight days isn’t long 
enough, if he’s been listening to those on the front line. Will he 
confirm those facts for the Assembly today? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, I’m very pleased to be 
working with many competent professionals across this 
province. And as this crystal meth problem has been identified 
over quite a number of years, they have been working to 
redesign and make sure that our programs do meet those needs. 
What we have is . . . Working together, DCRE [Department of 
Community Resources and Employment], the community 
resources, and Sask Health working with Ranch Ehrlo Society 
to service high-risk children and youth, where they do have that 
long-term treatment and also where they require specialized 
treatment services for addictions in other provinces. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the Calder Centre in Saskatoon, working together 
with the psychiatric in-patient mental health services, are 
continuing to make sure that their effective integrated treatment 
that can deal with these complex health issues that relate to 
crystal meth and other challenges. Mr. Speaker, we will 
continue to provide services for Saskatchewan people with the 
advice of the professionals. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
 
Mr. Wall: — Mr. Speaker, I don’t know if the minister or this 
Premier is hearing what Saskatchewan people are saying. 
They’re saying they need some action, and they need it 
immediately. 
 
We know that treatment facilities in places like Lloydminster 
are having to turn significant numbers of people away because 
there simply are no beds. We know how long it’d take for this 
Premier to deliver on his promise for mattress detox, Mr. 
Speaker. We know it was this government years ago that closed 
down the only youth addictions treatment facility that we had in 
the province of Saskatchewan. So I think they will forgive the 
people of the province if the people are a little bit skeptical 
about when this government will take action. 
 
Yesterday we heard from moms who are very concerned. 
We’ve heard from families. Again to the minister, this is an 
unique addiction. We finally appreciate the fact that this NDP 
[New Democratic Party] government understands it, something 
we’ve been saying for a year. It’s an unique addiction. 
Twenty-eight days isn’t long enough. What kind of treatment, 
what kind of specific treatment is the minister talking about? 
When will it be available in the province of Saskatchewan. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Health. 
 



April 21, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2613 

Hon. Mr. Nilson: — That member’s comments about us 
coming onto this whole problem in the last while is absolutely 
contrary to the facts. Mr. Speaker, in 1998 when I was in 
Durango, Colorado, with the Conference of Western Attorneys 
General of the United States, looking at this problem, I don’t 
know where that member was. I think he was out with some 
country western hall of fame kind of operation or something 
like that. 
 
But, Mr. Speaker, we have been working at this very carefully. 
We are working with the professionals. We’re making sure that 
we provide the services that are needed across . . . 
 
[14:00] 
 
The Speaker: — Order. Order, please. I just was unable to 
hear. And I asked for order, please. I ask for order. The Minister 
of Health. 
 
Hon. Mr. Nilson: — Mr. Speaker, the members ask about the 
duration of these programs. Mr. Speaker, they are extended to 
deal with the particular challenges around crystal meth. We 
brought in one of the world experts to Saskatchewan, Dr. 
Rossen, to talk about his sort of leading treatment program. And 
that is the kind of advice we’re getting to make sure we do this 
properly. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 

Amendments to Labour Legislation 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, once 
again we have an NDP government that says one thing and does 
another. On October 24, 2003, during the last election 
campaign, the Premier wrote the Saskatchewan Chamber of 
Commerce. He wrote this, and I quote: 
 

Our New Democratic government is always open to 
considering the concerns raised by the business 
community. However no legislation changes would occur 
without extensive consultations. 

 
Mr. Speaker, if what the Premier wrote was indeed the case, 
then why is the NDP pushing through with legislation to give 
expanded powers to the director of labour standards and the 
Chair of the Labour Relations Board? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, I don’t know where the 
member has been for the last number of months, but we have 
gone through some very public consultations on various pieces 
of legislation. 
 
He refers to two in his question. One of those is labour 
standards, and we’re looking to address some definitions within 
the Act, and section 74 of labour standards which has been a 
fairly public case that is now being decided upon by the 

Supreme Court of Canada. Mr. Speaker, that’s appropriate to 
address this situation which has been commented on, that it is 
inadequate and not fully described or articulated in the 
legislation or the regulations. 
 
And, Mr. Speaker, there is a variety of issues that are also being 
addressed with The Trade Union Act. And consultations have 
been going on, Mr. Speaker, and we have received much 
feedback from people right across the province. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, in a 
letter to the Premier dated yesterday from the Saskatchewan 
Business Council, they have some serious questions about the 
proposed amendments, and they do suggest that there has not 
been the consultations with them regarding Bill No. 86 and Bill 
No. 87. Their questions are these: why are they needed? What 
problems will they fix? 
 
These amendments would give the Labour Relations Board the 
same powers as a court. The board could make its own rules. 
They could make their own regulations. There has been no 
demonstrated need for such powers. Mr. Speaker, why are these 
powers needed? 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, we have had various 
communications with representatives from the Business 
Council. There were three meetings that were set up and three 
meetings that were cancelled by the representative of the 
Business Council. Mr. Speaker, this was ample opportunity to 
provide some feedback and we have since sent a letter, Mr. 
Speaker, saying that if they do have comments please get them 
in as soon as you can. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, the 
NDP government says one thing and does another. The Premier 
promised in this letter under New Democratic stationery that 
says there will be no legislative changes without consultation. 
Then it proposes massive new powers for the director of labour 
standards and the Chair of the Labour Relations Board. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why on earth would the Labour Relations Board 
need the authority to enter a place of business and conduct a 
search for evidence? Mr. Speaker, what kind of police state is 
the NDP government trying to create? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, here we go. The member 
one day is almost standing in his seat singing “Solidarity 



2614 Saskatchewan Hansard April 21, 2005 

Forever”, criticizing 0, 1, and 1 and talking like he is there to 
save the lives of working people. The next day he’s up on his 
feet criticizing The Trade Union Act, criticizing the changes 
and improvements to whistleblower’s legislation. Mr. Speaker, 
when you talk about saying one thing and doing another, well, 
Mr. Speaker, the opposition has said something different, said 
something different, said something different, depending on 
who the audience is. 
 
We can go from The Way Up, just believe, Mr. Speaker. Then 
we go into Enterprise Saskatchewan. Then we go into the 100 
Ideas, Mr. Speaker. These opposition, Mr. Speaker . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order, please. Order. Order. 
Order. Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, this opposition had said on 
one thing, said another thing, said another thing, said something 
different. Mr. Speaker, this government is taking action and 
improving things. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, one need only look at the news 
release of the Government of Saskatchewan dated February 18 
to see how the NDP can say one thing and do another. Reminds 
me, Mr. Speaker . . . with any luck this minister will have the 
same revelation she had on February 18 and forget the whole 
idea. 
 
While we’re on the topic of section 13.4, Mr. Speaker, the 
commitment to repeal this section is now two months and two 
days old. If this government can write miles and miles of new 
labour regulations in short order, why is it taking over two 
months to draft a one-clause amendment? Has the minister lost 
her resolve, or is she going to say one thing and do another? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, I know the member may 
have lost his sense of time, but I will remind him that we aren’t 
even two years into a four to five-year term. And we still have 
two months, we still have two months probably sitting in this 
legislature, Mr. Speaker. As I said to him the other . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order. Order, please. Minister 
of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — Mr. Speaker, I will say to the member 
opposite, we are normally here till June, sometimes into July. 
It’s early April. Mr. Speaker, we’ve still probably got two 
months left in this session, so there’s plenty of time. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for 
Canora-Pelly. 
 

Mr. Krawetz: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, 
businesses and employers across this province and the workers 
as well will be pleased to hear this minister say we’re here for 
five years. We’re here for five years. We might make those 
changes in five years, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Mr. Speaker, the letter . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. Order. Order, please. The 
member for Canora-Pelly. 
 
Mr. Krawetz: — Mr. Speaker, I will read from the letter to the 
Hon. Premier, cc’d to the Minister of Labour. It is dated 
yesterday, and I’m sure she has had a chance to read it. From 
page 2 it says this: 
 

It is our fear that if your government proceeds with Bill 86 
& 87, you will undoubtedly confirm Saskatchewan’s 
reputation as an anti-business jurisdiction. 

 
Mr. Speaker, that’s the kind of belief that there is outside of 
Saskatchewan, that this minister and this NDP government have 
produced a situation where we have an anti-business climate. 
When will the minister introduce her proposed legislation? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister of Labour. 
 
Hon. Ms. Higgins: — It’s amazing how the member forgets the 
words to “Solidarity Forever” that quickly. A couple of days 
ago he’s supporting workers. He’s criticizing the mandate, he’s 
criticizing the way collective bargaining is going because, Mr. 
Speaker, good news for the province, good news for the New 
Democratic government, bad news for the opposition. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Carrot 
River Valley. 
 

SaskPower’s Profits and Dividends 
 
Mr. Kerpan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well, Mr. Speaker, 
they just can’t help it. They say one thing and then they do 
another. The NDP government promises the people of 
Saskatchewan the lowest bundle of utility rates in Canada. Now 
the Minister Responsible for SaskPower says he’s not ruling out 
a rate increase. So why do we need a rate increase, Mr. 
Speaker? Well I’ll tell you why, Mr. Speaker, it’s . . . 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please members. Order. Order. Order. 
The floor is . . . Order. I recognize the member for Carrot River 
Valley. 
 
Mr. Kerpan: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Well I’ll tell you 
why we need a rate increase. Mr. Speaker, it’s because this 
government continues to play politics with our Crowns. And I 
want to ask the minister, Mr. Speaker, why does this 
government keep stripping money away from our power 
company for their own political purposes and then raising the 
rates? 
 



April 21, 2005 Saskatchewan Hansard 2615 

The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister 
Responsible for SaskPower. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, the return on equity for 
SaskPower in the last year as put in today’s annual report 
released today was 4.8 per cent. The return on equity is spent by 
any business in three different ways: a dividend to the 
shareholder, in this case really to the people of Saskatchewan, 
to be spent on health and education; secondly to pay down debt; 
thirdly to make new investments. Those are all good purposes; 
that’s what’s done. 
 
Now how we balance those three, Mr. Speaker, on the revenue 
of the company? Well, Mr. Speaker, I’ll tell you what we don’t 
do. We don’t take over 100 per cent like they did in the 
second-last year of the previous administration, and we don’t 
take over 200 per cent like they did in the last year of the 
previous administration, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Carrot 
River Valley. 
 
Mr. Kerpan: — Well, Mr. Speaker, let’s talk. Let’s talk about 
the debt for SaskPower. And here’s a coincidence, Mr. Speaker. 
The long-term debt for SaskPower’s up by $252 million. Mr. 
Speaker, the coincidence is that dividends paid over the last two 
years were almost $230 million. And last year this government 
forced SaskPower to pay more dividends than it could afford. 
Now ratepayers are likely going to have to pay more. 
 
Mr. Speaker, why is this NDP government running Crown 
corporations into the ground to try to balance its own books? 
Why is this government playing political games with the 
Crowns, and then they leave the ratepayers to clean up the 
mess? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
SaskPower. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, SaskPower continues to 
make investments. They make investments in refurbishing 
generation of plants, cogeneration of plants. There’s a major 
wind facility being built this year south of Swift Current, Mr. 
Speaker. That’s at a cost of the $250 million that the member 
mentions, Mr. Speaker. 
 
The debt/equity ratio of SaskPower is the best for any Crown 
utility in the country, Mr. Speaker. It’s far better than in 
Manitoba. It’s far better than New Brunswick, Mr. Speaker. The 
debt/equity ratio of the Crown corporation under this 
administration is of assistance to the debt rating of this province 
or the credit rating of this province, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Carrot 
River Valley. 
 
Mr. Kerpan: — Well, Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about the fact, the 

idea that the minister had a minute ago about a previous 
administration that actually took more than 100 per cent of 
profits out of SaskPower one year. 
 
Last year, Mr. Speaker, SaskPower made over $100 million in 
foreign currency exchanges. And what did this NDP 
government do with that paper gain, Mr. Speaker? It’s not a net 
profit. It’s a paper gain. They took it out and borrowed cash. A 
one time unexpected foreseen windfall and they took it out in 
cash. 
 
Now the minister says he’s concerned about the balance sheet, 
and he’s concerned about SaskPower’s debt, Mr. Speaker. So 
when is this, when is this government going to start to translate 
that concern into some sort of positive action? 
 
The Speaker: — Order, please. I would ask members to allow 
the hon. member to put his question. Member for Carrot River 
Valley. 
 
Mr. Kerpan: — Mr. Speaker, thank you. When is this 
government going to stop playing political games with 
SaskPower and all the Crown corporations? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the Minister for 
SaskPower. 
 
Hon. Mr. Quennell: — Mr. Speaker, again the facts are one 
thing, and what the members opposite want to say is something 
else. 
 
[14:15] 
 
The total public debt of this province is the lowest, and that 
includes Crown corporation debt, Mr. Speaker, is the lowest it 
has been since 1982. The Crown corporation debt, Mr. Speaker, 
the Crown corporation share of that is lower than it was in 
1982, Mr. Speaker. 
 
This administration has not played politics with the Crowns. 
This administration has not charged over 100 per cent, 200 per 
cent dividends on income in the Crowns, Mr. Speaker. That 
administration, the administration that the opposition 
represents, that they’re the inheritors to, they did that, Mr. 
Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the member for Carrot 
River Valley. 
 
Mr. Kerpan: — Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, this government 
across the way took over 100 per cent of the net profits out of 
SaskPower last year as a dividend to Crown Investments 
Corporation in order to balance a budget that they claim is 
balanced and is nowhere near balanced. They continue to 
hamstring Crown corporations like SaskPower and SaskTel and 
SaskEnergy in order to try and meet their overspending habits. 
 
Mr. Speaker, here’s a suggestion, and it’s idea no. 56 from the 
Saskatchewan Party’s 100 ideas. Why wouldn’t the government 



2616 Saskatchewan Hansard April 21, 2005 

implement a Crown dividend policy that establishes net return 
levels adequate to meet reinvestment requirements and then 
dedicate excess profits to infrastructure renewal? 
 
Mr. Speaker, will the minister stop the asset stripping that just 
hurts customers and it hurts the people at SaskPower? 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 
The Speaker: — The Chair recognizes the minister for CIC 
[Crown Investments Corporation of Saskatchewan]. 
 
Hon. Ms. Atkinson: — Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to report to the House that the Crown debt 
in this province, the overall Crown debt in this province has 
been reduced by $2.026 billion since 1991. Mr. Speaker, as 
well, as well, Mr. Speaker, consolidated net income from our 
Crowns has been $3.478 billion since 1991. And, Mr. Speaker, 
net profits have been three point four two seven point one 
billion dollars. 
 
The Crown corporations in this province have been able to 
provide good jobs, Mr. Speaker, good dividends to the people 
of this province to pay for important public services like health 
and education. And, Mr. Speaker, and Mr. Speaker — the 
Crowns have been able to lower the debt that was rung up by 
members opposite, Mr. Speaker. 
 
Some Hon. Members: — Hear, hear! 
 

INTRODUCTION OF BILLS 
 

Bill No. 205 — The Water Quality Recognition Day Act 
 
Mr. Brkich: — Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I move that Bill No. 
205, The Water Quality Recognition Day Act be introduced and 
read the first time.

River-Watrous that Bill No. 205, The Water Quality
